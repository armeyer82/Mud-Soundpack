track
An image of Kajva's surroundings come to mind...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
The incredibly large and ornately decorated pub known as Cheers.  The bar
itself is oddly positioned at the center of the room.  Tall stools surround
the bar and there is a cozy booth in each of the four corners of the pub. 
A hallway is east, a lounge north, the adventurer's guild south, and the
main exit back outside is west.  A sign hangs on one wall and an empty
chair sits next to the bar.
   There are four obvious exits: west, east, north and south.

You begin concentrating on a manor...
Your surroundings spin madly!
The cave is octagonal in shape and made of a smooth granite.  There are
several statues sitting in front of the north and west walls.  In the
center of the room there are nine busts sitting on pedestals.  A large
mural has been painted on the south wall.  In the middle of the east wall
there is a door, with a large phoenix resting above it.  Several banners
seem to float throughout the room.
   There are no obvious exits.
