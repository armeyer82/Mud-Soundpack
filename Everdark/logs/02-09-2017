The cave is octagonal in shape and made of a smooth granite.  There are
several statues sitting in front of the north and west walls.  In the
center of the room there are nine busts sitting on pedestals.  A large
mural has been painted on the south wall.  In the middle of the east wall
there is a door, with a large phoenix resting above it.  Several banners
