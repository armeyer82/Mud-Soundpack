A dank, warm room at the base of the tree beneath the earth in its root
system. A massive metal heater occupies much of the center of the room and
a wide workbench curves around the western, southern and eastern walls. A
smooth chute juts slightly into the room from the northwest and narrow
steps lead out of the room to the northeast.
   There are two obvious exits: northeast and northwest.

You plant your feet firmly on the ground and push hard upon it, launching
yourself up into the lowest branches of the great oak tree.
You reach up and pluck an acorn from the nearest branch.
You pop the acorn into your mouth and crunch down on it hard, swallowing
all the little bits.
Your head and shoulders pass in among the oak tree branches and the leaves
flutter violently in the breeze you have caused.
As the pieces of the acorn slide down your throat a sweet taste lingers in
your mouth.
Your feet gracefully touch back down upon the ground.
A wave of liquid warmth passes through your body as your hands begin to
tingle.
The scenery surrounding you begins to blur in vivid downward streaks and
you have the strangest sensation of falling.
The tingling ceases and you blink, suddenly realizing that you are no
taller than three apples high.

You tell Katra: But I never had to use the clay.
Katra tells you: no, it's ok, don't be sorry. I like trying to figure things
   out. Just frustrating at times is all, and sometimes I work things out by
   talking it out.

A pyrotechnic display of fire and ice spells out the name ``Magor'' high up
in the sky.
A guttural, troll-like voice echoes through rolling thunder:  Magor has
bought you human ilk a little reprieve from invasion and pillage.  But that
is all it is, a *little* reprieve.  You shall all suffer again at the hands
of my minions soon enough!  As for you, Magor, we shall meet again!
A gale of frigid air gusts across the realm carrying Flurandel's booming
voice in magnificent honor of Magor!
Flurandel shouts : GO GO GO GO GO GO !

   discovered rl things will take me away shortly.
19:18 You tell Katra: Ok, no problem. See you later. *cheek*
19:18 Katra tells you: *blush* thanks
19:21 Katra tells you [2m]: though I did discover with the clay I can shape
   it. But need (another!) part of a quasit to form it into his shape.
19:21 Katra tells you [2m]: hence, I see, you you wisely knew it wouldn't be
   done in 30mins or less.
19:22 You tell Katra: It's ok. I can't fault you for trying.
19:22 Katra tells you: but I suspect someone in the tree can tell me about
   this clay, or shaping. yalish, perhaps
19:22 You tell Katra: Perhaps.
19:22 Katra tells you: oooh, so enigmatic again. *grin*
19:23 You tell Katra: Heh, sorry. I don't want to give you too much info.
19:23 You tell Katra: But I never had to use the clay.
19:23 Katra tells you: no, it's ok, don't be sorry. I like trying to figure
   things out. Just frustrating at times is all, and sometimes I work things
   out by talking it out.
19:23 You tell Katra: I know the feeling.
19:23 Katra tells you: it's a girl thing. perhaps. *wink*
19:24 You tell Katra: I understand. Really. It helps me to talk about things
   too.
22:05 You tell Katra: Hey beautiful.
22:05 Katra tells you: hello again. You know where I am, even with rangering
   skills, I bet. *wink*
22:05 You tell Katra: Yep.
22:06 You tell Katra: Unfortunately, It's about my bed time. *ooc it's
   almost 7:20 in the morning for me.*
22:07 Katra tells you: gosh, we're 11 hours apart. You must be in Europe?
22:07 You tell Katra: I am. and where are you?
22:07 Katra tells you: Hawaii
22:07 You tell Katra: Heh, I was going to guess that or Alaska.
22:07 Silk tells you: are you helping her or confusing her?
22:07 Katra tells you: *nod* Not much else in this timezone.
22:08 You tell Silk: Helping her, of course.
22:08 You tell Katra: True.
22:08 You tell Silk: But not trying to give too much away.
Silk tells you: is that the voodoodoll clay shes talking about? is that why
   she wants to use it with his bits?

track
An image of Katra's surroundings come to mind...
----------------------------------------------------------------------
A dank, warm room at the base of the tree beneath the earth in its root
system. A massive metal heater occupies much of the center of the room and
a wide workbench curves around the western, southern and eastern walls. A
steps lead out of the room to the northeast.
   There are two obvious exits: northeast and northwest.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
You lose the image momentarily...
OK, no longer tracking.
Silk tells you [3m]: I know we have tobe careful but sometimes if jkiing
   around a bit talking too we acccidently encourage them to think more
   about the funny ideas so I wasnt sure

Yeah, it was, but I specifically told her I didn't have to use it for the quest.
