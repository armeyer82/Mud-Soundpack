01:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

01:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:32 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

01:32 For a top, you are wearing a plaid button down shirt.  For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of black cargo pants over a pair of cotton briefs.  You have on some black leather boots.  You are also wearing a backpack, a leather briefcase, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, an asteroid hauling supply kit, a strawberry ring pop, a stun power cartridge storage container, a concealed hip holster, a small palm-size metallic blue personal lore computer, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the outside, and a yellow two-way FTL communicator.

01:32 You are carrying nothing.

01:32 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

01:33 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a drifting cloud of tritium.

01:33 You see nothing special.

01:33 It is open.
Inside it you see a title of ownership, a copy of "Zion 1st Edition Complete Guide To Modern Spaceflight Vol. 3: Basic Systems", a copy of "Zion 1st Edition Complete Guide To Modern Spaceflight Vol. 2: The Pilot League", a title of ownership, a copy of "Zion 1st Edition Complete Guide To Modern Spaceflight Vol. 1: Modern Starships", a copy of "Zion 1st Edition Complete Guide To Modern Spaceflight Vol. 4: Flight Basics", a copy of "A Pilot's Guide To Shopping in the Sixty", a teleoperator card, a portable currency converter, a small payment slip, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, a temporary wormhole drive, a standard starship flightbag, a pair of plain white spacesuit gloves, a metafrequency FTL transmitter, a hardcopy print of "I love you Rolando!", a heart-shaped box of chocolates, a photo of Lileah Rose, and a fuzzy stuffed bear.

Teleoperated Mining

Teleoperated mining consists of controlling a mining drone from a remote location, using it to drill into asteroids to find precious materials.  It provides a way to make money without having to use a ship.  The startup prices are rather expensive, however.

Starting Out:
First, locate a teleoperated mining center.  There is one present on each capital.  The first room you enter is the store.  Before you may do anything, you must REGISTER and receive a card.  (You may later UNREGISTER, though it is not necessary and you will lose everything.)  Then check out the MENU.  You will need to purchase the following:
	-a mining drone
	-a sensor system
	-some drill bits

Mining Drone:
While very expensive, you will only ever need to buy one drone.

Sensors:
As expected, the more expensive sensor systems are better.  Better sensor systems enable drone to find mining sites more easily.  This means it can find closer sites, reducing drone travel time.

Drill Bits:
The more expensive drill bits are stronger.  The stronger a drill bit, the more material it is able to locate at a mining site.  This means less travelling to new sites.

Controlling the Drone:
Go into the next room, which is the control room.  Card in hand, type START.  You will be presented with a menu.  From this point on, you can type MENU to see your current options.  Activate the drone, and then l
05:37 oad it with bits.  It can only hold four at a time.  Send it to a new location, and then begin drilling.  If a bit breaks, fit it with a new one.  If your drone can't find any more material at a location, move to another.  And finally, if your storage fills up, return to base and transfer.  When this is done, you may go back to the first room and type PAYMENT for your money.

05:38 You receive the 5050000.00 AEU credits stored on your card.

05:38 I don't understand that.

05:38 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

05:38 Current overall point level: 198
Current combat point level: 0

You see a group of sleeping people here.
You can go north, west, and down.

17:46 Some lights on the two-person light freighter "Sandbagger" suddenly flash several times.

17:46 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Airlock]
You see an internal stun turret here.
You can go out and into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

17:46 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

17:46 You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, a large leather lounge couch, and an internal stun turret here.
You can go south and out.

17:46 I can't find "chiar."

17:46 You sit down on a large beanbag chair.

17:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:47 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

17:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

17:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:22 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

18:22 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

18:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

18:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

18:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:23 I don't understand that.

18:23 I don't understand that.

18:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water. Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the Spaceport.
The one-person flitter "Clarity", the eight-person heavy merchant ship "Invincible", the one-person flitter "Freaking Out", and the two-person light freighter "Sandbagger" are landed here.

18:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

18:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
