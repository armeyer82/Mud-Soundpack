stormy: attention, the first founder of this pack, snappp blue scale used to gather some music files for the pack, since they were so big, they got removed a while ago. now if you want to download the larger versions of the music files, you can do it from this link, https://www.dropbox.com/s/8nog5urm2hm1ddb/music.zip?dl=1
Stormy: Attention, the VIP 1 version of the pack no longer beeing supported anymore do to the limitations of it. As an other fact, we no longer have the pack, thus can no longer host a link anymore, for this reason, all the information about vip1 has been removed.
Stormy: if you know someone playing any instrument, have a decent mic and want to help the pack, please contact stormy, or any VIP experience dev through inGame mail, thanks
Angelica: Attention. I am writing this to make sure everyone is aware. There is a slightly new administration team for the VIPMud Experience. We have deleted all prior announcements. The 3 of us working the most on it are Frederick, Stormy, and me, along with others. Please check the info for the VIPMud Cosmic Rage Experience for more information. Credit for the lion's share of work, especially in the 2 prior years to this, does go, and will always go, to Snapp Blue Scale. We are keeping it alive and updated for your use. If you're not already part of the soundpack folder, please get in touch with either myself or Lara Stardust, and we can get you added. Thank you for your time, and I now return you to your normal Cosmic Raging!
