653. Several changes have been made to ship combat code today. Firstly, upon changing the alert status, all sound is no longer required to stop. See, I said I'd work on a fix eventually. Second, code should no longer throw errors if something isn't toggled correctly. Thirdly, if you are in a room other than the control room when the ships status changes, the code will see this and start playing combat music and other related things assuming you have them enabled. Fourthly. If you decide to change the currently playing combat music, all sounds are not required to stop. And lastly. Thanks to Jason, we have two new aliases for ship combat. WS will fire a warningshot, and hsig will check your ships heat signature.

545. I don't know why I didn't think of this sooner. I was just sitting here and the idea came to mind last night. What if I could use different soundpack and buffer settings across different characters? Well friends. Now you can! If you actually make new character entries in VIP for each of your characters and don't just log in using 1 entry for all chars on the mud, then this will work for you! For example. I have two chars right now, and each one has a totally different buffer list, and different soundpack settings. I have for example, ambience enabled on one char, but not on the other. Do you see how this works? I am of course happy to help in any way possible.  ***Note. Upon first running of the pack for each of your char entries within VIP, you *Must* either type SaveBuffers or use the save buffers key. Failing to do this will throw a few huge errors at you. Upon saving the first time, then you can go and do what you will with your buffer list.
Copy Cosmic Rage.set, Cosmic Rage/misc/Buffers.set, ConfigurationManager.set and Soundpack.set.

You can now go from 0 percent to 100 percent, rather than the 5 percent to 90 percent you could before.  The second change is, seeing as many people were complaining about it, I've gotten rid of all the okay dialogues that would pop up when you'd toggle something. The message will now only be spoken, and not stored in your output window.
Copy Cosmic Rage/misc.
517. I have removed the socials toggle as it was causing issues with a few things.

514. You may now use alt-shift page up and alt-shift-page down to jump by twenty items in each buffer. In addition, alt left and right arrows will now tell you how many items are in the buffer you move to. There is a VIPMud bug that will say one item when there are actually none, but this will correct itself once at least one item comes into that buffer. Also, Flight control is now 100 percent fixed.
Copy Cosmic Rage/misc/Buffers.set and Cosmic Rage/ships/FlightControl.set.
513. As it was creating a few issues, the pack is no longer auto-saving your settings. Instead, the pack will save when you disconnect from the moo, or upon use of the control-S key.

New sounds have also been created for adding, and deleting buffers, A new sound will also play if you already have a buffer active. With this change, we believe all errors with buffers are fixed. If you find more, please let Snapp or Kavi know and give them as much info as you can that would help them to test and recreate the error.

499. In order to get rid of the parsing errors some people were getting, we've modified how saving and loading the list of active buffers works. Now, once you remove and add buffers to your liking, type savebuffers. When you reload vipmud or the soundpack, simply type loadbuffers to get your preferences back! Remember, messages will save in buffers whether you have them active or not. Do note, If you try to load buffers before you've saved your list of buffers, it might throw an error at you. Also, if you get rid of all the buffers in your list and try using alt-left and alt-right to move to another buffer, that also throws an error.
Copy Cosmic Rage.set and Cosmic Rage/misc.

491. Added the flight control buffer.
Copy Cosmic Rage/misc/Buffers.set and Cosmic Rage/ships/FlightControl.set.
490. Good news! We have completely recoded how buffers work, from scratch. Alt plus left or right arrows will still switch between added buffers. Alt 1 through alt 0 also still work as expected, but you will be told no item if the selected buffer doesn't have enough items for the key you press. Alt home moves you to the earliest item in the selected buffer, while alt end moves you to the most recent. Alt up and down arrows move to the previous and next buffer item, respectively. Don't want all those buffers? Use alt shift left arrow to choose one to remove, and alt shift right arrow to choose from a quite large master list to add into your buffers. More buffers coming soon! Note that when changing from one buffer to another, you will always be put at the earliest message. Your choice of active buffers will save when the soundpack settings save. If you add a buffer, even prievious text will show up in it right away! Buffers do reset their contents when you reload the pack. This was coded by Faylen and tested and modified by Snapp. Other developers, while you are welcome to borrow ideas, please do not copy code directly. Thank you and enjoy!

When you change the volume of something, There is a sound that will play to let you know how loud or quiet that volumes setting has become.

You will now hear the boarding and disembarking sounds for ships even with ambiance disabled. When you connect to the moo, all Ambiences are enabled ready to play unless you've toggled them off and either saved the settings manually, or let the auto-save feature do it for you. If you use either the #pc 0 stop command, or if you use the control-F11 key to stop all playing sounds, you will need to reenable planetary ambiance and music. This is an issue with VIPMud and can not be fixed by me. As far as I have been able to test, all Ambiences are working as they should and no longer giving errors.

240. Added sounds for old earth cars!
Copy Amb.set, cars.set, Cosmic Rage.set, vehicle.set, and sounds/ambiences/OldCar.wav, and sounds/general/Cars.
239. This isn't a change to the soundpack necessarily, but it is a change to how the soundpack reacts with VIPMud2.0.  Included in the root of the soundpack folder, you will see a file called Sounds.ini.  This file tells VIP how to handle the playing of audio files. For example. Ever been on a mission and had error after error thrown at you because you were blowing up tons of ships? This is do to the fact that by default, VIP2.0 can only play 35 sounds at a time before it gives up.  I have changed it so now VIP can play up to 100 sounds at a time.
Do note however, if you have limited RAM, I'm not sure how this will effect your machine. If you have say under 2gb of memory, I don't advise copying sounds.ini.  If however you do wish to copy the file it goes in your documents/vip Mud directory.  So for example, C:\Users\Snapp\Documents\VIP Mud/sounds.ini, and answer yes to the rplace file prompt.
