00:39:01 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What we do to ourselves is irrelevant if the alliance doesn't remain in the Accord. You fferring to rent out your transport was honestly a blatent insult to what we were trying to accomplish.

00:40:39 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's just gonna cause headlines that downplay what they are trying to do. Which, it did."

00:41:01 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling, you are certainly entitled to your opinion. However, a firm statement needed to be made about our refusal to gather resources for our alliance in the immediate future. If that statement happened to cost our alliance several billion credits in the process in order to start driving the point home, we will do what we must."

00:41:07 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anyway, that's my view. I am done."

00:42:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. First, my apologies to the AEU pilots. I actually totally agree with what you're doin...I told ya awhile back that you needed to do somethin...I'm proud of ya. No jokin here.

01:05:32 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Preferrably a kitten."

01:05:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. I'll check later."

01:09:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:09:39 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:09:40 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:09:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

01:09:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:09:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:09:59 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:10:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:10:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:10:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:10:20 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:10:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:10:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:10:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

01:10:22 You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:10:24  You are wearing a pristine white sports jacket, a short-sleeved navy and white madras plaid cotton shirt, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:10:24 You are carrying nothing.

01:10:27 You exit the ship.

01:10:27 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The augmented explorer "Oracle", the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 149", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a personal hoverpallet, and Chuck the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

01:10:36 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

01:10:36 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Aisling and Nissi Valdaire are standing here. Melinda Michaels and Ali Candan are sitting on a cushy booth seat.
You can go out.

01:10:48 Aisling waves.

01:10:53 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:10:53 You wave.

01:11:09 Ali Candan takes a sip of an icy-cold glass of strawberry milk.

01:12:32 Ali Candan takes a sip of an icy-cold glass of strawberry milk.

01:14:12 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 10,869,531.25 credits from a xenology submission.

01:14:26 Ali Candan takes a sip of an icy-cold glass of strawberry milk.

01:14:38 Ali Candan finishes off an icy-cold glass of strawberry milk.

01:14:41 Ali Candan stands up from a cushy booth seat.

01:14:42 Ali Candan puts a glass in a small red trash can.

01:14:44 Ali Candan strides out.

01:17:44 Aisling glances down at her matte orange oxide wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

01:18:07 Aisling says to you, "I am going to assume you will be doing most of the speaking?"

01:19:01 You say to Aisling, "I'm not sure who is going to be doing most of the speaking."

01:19:01 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Magnetic Fields". The organization has earned 1,931,980.98 credits.

01:19:16 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person cipactli "Rainstorm" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

01:19:19 Aisling asks, "Who is confirmed to be going?"

01:19:43 You say to Aisling, "But anything you tell m, can definitely help. Lily, Evangeline and myself."

01:19:49 Aisling nods.

01:20:21 Aisling says, "From my understanding there will only be one Council member attending."

01:20:28 You nod. "Ok."

01:20:35 Aisling says, "The Council itself is not too pleased with all of this."

01:20:42 You say, "I understand."

01:20:59 Aisling says, "I do not know who it will be."

01:21:15 Aisling says, "My guess is probably Ryland, or Frolov."

01:21:17 You say, "Ok, that was goig to be my next questionm, but you answered."

01:21:22 You say, "Answered it."

01:21:50 Aisling says, "Members of the Ninth will be there to witness. But we are not part of negotiation."

01:21:58 You nod.

01:22:09 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person medium transport "Magnetic Fields".

01:22:12 Aisling asks, "What are you planning to offer?"

01:22:28 Emily Ford just arrived.

01:22:33 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a cushy booth seat.

01:22:43 Emily Ford says, "Evening."

01:22:44 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

01:23:14 Aisling says, "Council is going to need something serious, I think. They feel that this is not being taken seriously by AEU."

01:23:24 Aisling says, "That is going to be hard for you."

01:23:38 Aisling says, "Because a serious offer to us is not going to be a good offer for Best."

01:23:48 You say to Aisling, "We have discussed a few things to offer, but we would have to make sure the ggovernment would back us up. I definitely understand. And no, it wouldn't be."

01:23:52 Emily flashes a quick smile as she wanders over to a booth and settles herself.

01:23:56 Emily Ford sits down on a cushy booth seat.

01:23:58 Aisling nods.

01:24:15 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:24:50 Nissi Valdaire says, "You might wanna decide who's gonna speak though. Or like, prepare at all."

01:24:51 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:25:09 Aisling says, "Indeed."

01:25:33 You nod.

01:25:34 Emily Ford gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:25:39 You say, "I will be right back."

01:25:45 Emily Ford asks, "They're not sending someone trained to negotiate?"

01:25:53 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]

01:31:28 You peer out...

01:31:28 
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The augmented explorer "Oracle", the three-person clipper "Firestorm", and the two-person Accord gemini "Family Jewels" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a personal hoverpallet, and Chuck the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

01:31:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Morris just has to land his ship."

01:31:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "It's ok i'm just still trying to understand all of this."

01:31:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, ""Ok."

01:32:01 I don't understand that.

01:32:03 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:32:07 You say, "I understand."

01:32:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What ship shule?"

01:32:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Were you required or coersed into destroying your ships?"

01:32:33 Starship "Firestorm" unlocked.

01:32:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Firestorm, I just unlocked the ship."

01:32:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. Morris is<coming?"

01:32:50 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:32:53 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

01:32:54 Starship "Firestorm" locked.

01:32:57 You wave to Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

01:32:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:32:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No."

01:32:59 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:33:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I see. You guys were just clearing the pad."

01:33:29 You glance around at your surroundings.

01:33:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good luck you three. Do us proud."

01:33:59 You say to Lily, "It was strictly voluntary, but nowwe need to talk about the meeting with the council."

01:34:26 Shule takes a deep breath and looks around, "I just met with Aisling.

01:34:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Huh we're not to talk about anything with the council?"

01:34:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So we're not going?"

01:34:58 You say, "We are."

01:35:12 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So... what is going to happen?"

01:35:15 You say, "That's why we're meeting right now. I just met with Aisling."

01:35:20 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:35:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Ok then what did Aisling want to relate?"

01:35:31 You say, "There will be oe council member there."

01:35:38 You say, "One, I mean."

01:35:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Oh none?"

01:35:43 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident asks, "One? Who is it?"

01:35:48 You say, "We don't know."

01:35:53 You say, "Who it's going to be."

01:35:59 "And what are we to say or are you going to speak for us?" Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:36:10 You say, "Memebers of the ninth fleet will be there, but only as witnesses."

01:36:15 You say, "Members."

01:36:22 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods. "All right..."

01:36:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok then I want to stress that we don't speak of what we won't get by losing access to the skims."

01:36:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know it kinda got sprung on you folks. We would have had more time to discuss it but the council was starting to think we weren't taking it seriously."

01:36:43 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Eli, hush for a few while I try not to pound my face in the wall."

01:36:54 You say, "We need to offer them something serious as they feel this whole thing is not being taken seriusly by the AEU."

01:37:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I said before this is more to do with our not supporting what happened with the flotilla."

01:37:16 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:37:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You both can disagree though and take it in any direction you want but if we mention what we're losing, they will just look at us as whiners and being selfish."

01:37:51 You say, "As for who is speaking for all of us, I don't know. We need to decide. I can, but I need to know what we can offer them."

01:37:57 "If you don't know what to say, say nothing." Evangeline says quietly.

01:38:28 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I don't know. The revo battery is about the only thing I can think that they'd want, though I don't know if Ather would like us negociating that, but he isn't going, is he?"

01:38:32 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "No, I agree with you."

01:39:24 Lily says to you, "Ok it's up to you."

01:39:32 You nod to Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

01:39:41 You say to Evangeline, "It's just us three."

01:39:52 Lily says to Evangeline, "W aen't able to do that."

01:39:56 Evangeline nods her head and sighs. "All right, so now we have to decide who is speaking for us."

01:39:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We aren't."

01:40:18 "All right, well what else could they want from us?" Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:40:52 [MTTS] Ulias: I secretly love how the Squidmind just won't let the AEU pilots have a win, it's hilarious and so much fun.

01:40:57 You say, "About the only thing I cn say about any offer we make is that we will approach our government and strongly urge them to accept the offer, but I cannot finalize the offer."

01:40:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We can certainly ask them for what they would want though."

01:41:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

01:41:11 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:41:13 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I see."

01:41:19 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Alright."

01:41:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But we can't tell them that we will give them anything."

01:41:28 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "No, we need to make it a concrete thing."

01:41:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're not the AEU government."

01:41:38 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "And we can't make a stupid deal either that won't fall through."

01:41:48 [MTTS] Squidmind: We aren't intentionally stopping anything, we're having the game world react to what's being done!

01:41:50 [MTTS] Ulias: Everyday, I wake up just waiting to see what crazy headlines are coming next.

01:41:55 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods. "This is true, but since the government clearly doesn't care..."

01:42:09 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh I know. I didn' tmean it like that.

01:42:23 You ask, "So, either of you want to be the mai speaker?"

01:42:27 You say, "Main."

01:42:38 [MTTS] usfolks: I think the only thing I've been surprised by thus far is the privatization if the corps. Everything else was eluded to back as far as I think September.

01:42:38 Lily says to you, "Well we need to let them know that we will also make a strong statement against any future military acitons towards them."

01:42:41 Evangeline coughs and looks at you.

01:42:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Actions."

01:42:52 I don't understand that.

01:42:54 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:43:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is very important."

01:43:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Of, not if.

01:43:17 [MTTS] Ulias: I suppose a better way to say it, is just that I love how the AEU pilots just can't get a win, not that the Squidmind is doing it specifically.

01:44:34 You ask, "Ok, so. I can offer to talk to the goverment about the Rvo battery, what else?"

01:44:48 [General Communication] People's Defense Commissar Aisling transmits, "Would AEU delegates please meet in Old Earth Lounge? I would like to leave shortly so we are a little early."

01:45:02 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We will be right there."

01:45:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well as pilots we will issue a statement concerning the incident with the flotilla unless you two disagree on that. I believe this is at the crux of this though."

01:45:41 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I think we should issue a statement."

01:45:49 You ask, "Ok, you both ready?"

01:45:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes."

01:46:04 Shule takes several deep breaths.

01:46:07 You hold Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident's hand, taking her into your group.

01:46:10 You hold Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's hand, taking her into your group.

01:46:13  You are wearing a pristine white sports jacket, a short-sleeved navy and white madras plaid cotton shirt, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers.

02:05:25 --

02:05:26 I missed the HypAc European Grand Prix for this, so it better be good.

It took over a grand cycle to get authorization to attend.

02:05:50 Shule reads a white index card and then looks up.

02:05:57 Evangeline nods her head quietly, though still stands up, hands at her sides. She looks at the index card, leaning forward to read.

02:06:09 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Sooner we begin, sooner I can make many apologies to my lady."

02:06:18 Lily considers the index card ... noding slowly.

02:06:59 Shule looks around at the people at the table and turning to the coucil members, he says, "Greetings, I would first like to thank you for meeting with us."

02:09:56 Shule looks around at the council members, making eye contact and waiting patiently.

02:10:03 Aleksei makes a small gesture across the table. "Yes. Was short notice, but here we are."

02:11:21 Shule nods respectfully to Aleksei.

02:13:23 Aisling glances down at a matte orange oxide wrist-mounted chronometer and then to you.

02:14:00 Evangeline stares at you, fidgeting in her standing position.

02:14:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

02:14:46 Anfisa of Marzore props her head up with her fist as she looks at the motley crew of AEU in the room.

02:14:59 Shule takes a deep breath and making eye contact with each person around the table, he says, "I'd like to say that the pilot corps is very upset about what happened with the Third Flotilla of the AEU."

02:15:59 You say, "I can assure you that we will be writing to our government expressing our deep displeasure for what happened."

02:16:20 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "And?"

02:16:52 Chairwoman Candida Doyle helps herself to a white index card from a compact hip pouch.

02:16:59 Candida scribbles on a white index card.

02:17:19 Chairwoman Candida Doyle puts a white index card on a large ebony table.

02:17:21 Aisling grimaces and rubs her face with her hand.

02:17:32 --

02:17:32 I missed the HypAc European Grand Prix for this, so it better be good.

It took over a grand cycle to get authorization to attend.
--

02:17:33 Councilman Brandon Ryland nods to Chairwoman Candida Doyle.

02:17:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Chairwoman Candida Doyle.

02:17:46 --

02:17:46 Stern letters clearly solve all problems.
--

02:18:33 Anfisa of Marzore stifles a laugh by covering her mouth and coughing.

02:19:58 Turning to the council members, Shule asks, "Is there anything else we can do or you would suggest we do?"

02:22:02 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Do about what? This is not live version of famous Dear Aleksei advice column. You are here to tell us what you can do."

02:23:37 You nod to Councilman Aleksei Frolov.

02:26:11 Councilman Brandon Ryland sighs.

02:26:17 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "Let me make this simple for you. We were willing to renegotiate the agreement we had with your alliance prior to it ending just as we did with the others, even with your increased hostility towards us. Your government declined to do so and the agreement ended.  You pilots then demanded we give you a free extension to skim usage until you were willing to enter into negotiations with us and when we rejected that ridiculous demand you made another one: that we meet with representatives immediately.  We have tried to meet you halfway here, and at every step you have thrown our good will into our faces, as you have repeatedly over the past trade cycle.  What exactly are you trying to accomplish here?  Is this your best, or are you merely doing his work?"

02:28:01 You say, "We are here to try to negotiate AEU's access to the skim. Since our government declined to send anyone, we have come ourselves to represent the pilot coprs."

02:28:08 You say, "Corps."

02:28:22 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Yes, thank you for repeating part what I just said."

02:28:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident frowns.

02:31:45 You say, "But we cannot finalize any offer on behalf of the government. We can only tell the government what we feel is best and do everything we can to persuade them to accept an offer."

02:32:30 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "How do you plan to do that?"

02:36:32 You say, "Well, first we need something to propose to the government. As to how we can try to persuade them, we would need to work with our Voice and other AEU pilots to put pressure on the government."

02:37:10 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "You have just said what you said a few moments ago. How exactly will you put pressure on them?"

02:39:01 Aleksei sighs and shakes his head. "Is stage fright, perhaps. Is natural." He gestures at Evangeline. "How about you? You are spokesperson now. Speak, speak."

02:39:06 You say to Brandon, "At this point in time, I am not sure how exactly we will do that. That will take some plainng."

02:39:11 You say, "Planning."

02:40:16 Brandon pinches the bridge of his nose.

02:40:54 Aisling sighs heavily and shakes her head.

02:41:12 Anfisa of Marzore leans close to Aisling and whispers something in her ear.

02:41:12 You overhear Anfisa of Marzore whispering to Aisling, "Choking without even chanting. Impressive."

02:41:22 Aisling nods to Anfisa of Marzore.

02:42:29 Blinking, Evangeline blushes and says, "I was thinking that if letters didn't work we could call our government and demand that they help us, though I don't know how that will help anything in the long run, since demands have fallen on deaf ears. I am not certain how the pressure will be put on, but I think the letters, phonecalls, something to get the government to pay attention?" She looks embarrassed.

02:42:51 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

02:43:03 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

02:43:06 Blinking, Evangeline blushes and says, "I was thinking that if letters didn't work we could call our government and demand that they help us, though I don't know how that will help anything in the long run, since demands have fallen on deaf ears. I am not certain how the pressure will be put on, but I think the letters, phonecalls, something to get the government to pay attention?" She looks embarrassed.

02:43:38 Chairwoman Candida Doyle helps herself to a white index card from a compact hip pouch.

02:43:47 Aisling leans close to Anfisa of Marzore and whispers something in her ear.

02:43:47 You overhear Aisling whispering to Anfisa of Marzore, "I even told Shule all he needs to do is come in and tell them what they are prepared to try to offer."

02:44:11 Chairwoman Candida Doyle puts a white index card on a large ebony table.

02:44:17 Read what?

02:44:21 --

02:44:21 I missed the HypAc European Grand Prix for this, so it better be good.

It took over a grand cycle to get authorization to attend.
--

02:44:27 --

02:44:28 Stern letters AND phone calls clearly solve all problems.
--

02:44:35 With some trepedation, Evangeline leans forward and reads the card.

02:44:56 You can't read a deck of Horrible People cards.

02:45:02 --

02:45:02 Stern letters clearly solve all problems.
--

02:45:09 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "I thought we were here to discuss accelerator access. Did not know I would be teaching political activism one oh one."

02:46:00 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Are you certain this is the best use of your time? I am starting to wonder if it is the best use of ours if neither of you have an idea on how to convince your own government to agree to something."

02:46:12 Councilman Brandon Ryland gestures vaguely at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:46:23 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "What about you, what do you have to say?"

02:47:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am willing to l listen to your preferences and help Shule and others prepare whatever it takes to communicate sternly and effectively to our Government that they need to adhere."

02:48:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We are here in good faith and although we are not skilled negotiatiors, we w want to help to make this work."

02:48:34 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "Your colleagues have already said that. Our question is how?"

02:49:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well the how part is fullfilling what you want from the AEU to satisfy this agreement."

02:49:35 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "What we want? We did not insist on this meeting."

02:49:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:49:42 Councilman Brandon Ryland nods to Councilman Aleksei Frolov.

02:50:21 Chairwoman Candida Doyle sighs.

02:50:30 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "We have sat before you for many mincycles now and barely established why you are here. Is time for forward progress. What is your offer to us? Speak of practicalities."

02:50:58 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Any of you."

02:51:21 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "You wanted this negotiation to take place.  You demanded we come here at this time with no real preparation.  You are now saying that any agreement we make here has no guarantee of being upheld by your government, but would be upheld by us.  This is not a negotiating tactic that engenders a desire for us to continue negotiating."

02:51:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How can we satisfy you then? What would enable you to be comfortatle that we could follow through though?"

02:51:36 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "By telling us how you actually plan to follow through."

02:52:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I personally will do whatever it takes to go to our Government if it risks my license to do so. What happens is unacceptable and if I can do anything about it it will never happen again."

02:52:53 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "Whatever it takes?  Like what?"

02:53:01 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "You must either convince us the government will uphold your agreement, or make an agreement you will be able to uphold in spite of your government."

02:53:16 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "This 'doing whatever it takes' and 'saying whatever you want us to' you people keep saying has no meaning."

02:53:27 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Vague aphorisms do not actually tell us what you will do."

02:53:29 Councilman Brandon Ryland nods to Councilman Aleksei Frolov.

02:53:58 Anfisa of Marzore leans close to Aisling and whispers something in her ear.

02:55:07 Aisling leans close to Anfisa of Marzore and whispers something in her ear.

02:56:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Ok so you know we've attempted to hear you more than one time. Again, my question is what specifically do you want from the aEU?"

02:57:21 Aleksei says slowly, "What. Is. Your. Offer?

02:57:32 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "A guarantee that any agreement made here will be upheld.  We keep asking you what you are offering."

02:57:52 Lily turns to shule and asks what did we agree to offer?

02:58:12 Aleksei holds his head in his hands.

02:58:17 Aisling shakes her head.

02:58:35 Brandon covers his eyes with his hand.

02:58:56 Aleksei murmurs softly, "Forgive me, Annabelle. Will not believe me when I tell story, I know it."

03:00:00 Aleksei looks up and spreads his hands. "Let us speak of hypothetical."

03:00:10 Aleksei says to Lily, "You have favorite ship, yes? Everyone has favorite ship."

03:00:21 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "You like favorite ship. You see no reason to sell favorite ship."

03:00:32 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "I come up and say, 'I want this ship. Your favorite ship.'"

03:00:40 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "I say, 'What do you want for ship?'"

03:00:57 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "You say, 'I have no reason to sell ship. What is offer? Is it good enough that I should consider it?'"

03:01:11 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "I say nothing for mincycles. Perhaps I nod to companion for some reason."

03:01:20 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Then I say, 'I want ship. What do you want for it?'"

03:01:23 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "This is where we are."

03:01:31 Chairwoman Candida Doyle nods to Councilman Aleksei Frolov.

03:02:08 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Is time for convincing offer."

03:04:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wish I could offer you the tech you want form us but the best I can do here is to demand that our government cease and desist with any future encroachment into Mutuality territories."

03:04:45 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "So your offer is that the AEU will not attack us?"

03:04:47 Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "What? What is tech we want? Did we say we want tech?"

03:04:54 Aleksei says to Brandon, "Did we say we want tech?"

03:04:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You haven't but other pilots have."

03:05:05 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "We haven't said anything beyond asking for clarification."

03:05:14 Aleksei says to Candida, "Did we say we want tech?"

03:05:16 Lily nods slowly.

03:05:46 Candida glances over to Aleksei and shrugs with her palms facing towards the ceiling.

03:06:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok then the best we can offer is that we do whatever it takes to gain the attention of our Government through our Liaison or otherwise to demand that they cease and desist with any future encroachment into Mutuality Territories."

03:06:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "However if there is anything else, we want to know what you need from us."

03:06:59 You say to Brandon, "And I, for one, will respond to defend your pilots should you come under attack."

03:07:05 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "As will I."

03:07:06 Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "Offer is that if we agree to accelerator access, you will ask government not to attack us?"

03:07:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I would as well."

03:07:14 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "So you are saying that you want access to the skims and in return you will perhaps ineffectually demand that your government not attack us."

03:07:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I would risk my license to do so because I have the utmost respect for Mutuality."

03:07:33 Chairwoman Candida Doyle helps herself to a white index card from a compact hip pouch.

03:07:56 Chairwoman Candida Doyle puts a white index card on a large ebony table.

03:08:04 --

03:08:04 Watch out, they might get a papercut from the sternly-worded letters.
--

03:08:06 Brandon says to you, "Wonderful. You agree to go to war against your own alliance?"

03:09:15 Lily says to Brandon, "Yes this is what we are offering."

03:09:35 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "We can lose our licenses over this."

03:09:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'it's worth it Eva."

03:09:59 You nod to Councilman Brandon Ryland. "It's the offer I can make that I know I can uphold."

03:10:04 Evangeline is about to say something, but shuts her mouth when Lily just pipes up.

03:10:36 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Agreement is... let me find the words..."

03:11:10 Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "AEU pilots offer defensive pact pledged to Mutuality? They promise to attack own government if government attacks Mutuality?"

03:12:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No we won't eventually. We will demand that our Government will not attack Mutuality."

03:12:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And do it now."

03:12:39 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Hold on, we are not suggesting we START a war."

03:12:48 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "I see. Then without accelerator access you would be in favor of attack against Mutuality."

03:13:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No we will never been in favor of any attacks on Mutuality I know Iwon't be."

03:14:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Even without access to the QSA."

03:14:13 You say, "Neither would I."

03:14:29 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head. "We want to stop attacks not escolate them to a higher level."

03:14:45 Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "So you say you will oppose attacks regardless of accelerator access?"

03:14:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ues."

03:14:59 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes, exactly. We don't want you to be attacked."

03:15:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes definitely."

03:15:07 You nod.

03:15:15 Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "Appreciated then. Now back to discussion of accelerator access. What is offer?"

03:15:50 Anfisa of Marzore belches loudly and says, "I am sick of whispering snark of this farce. Look. Words do not mean anything now. Actions do. Fucking say what you will do and actually do it."

03:16:10 Councilman Brandon Ryland stares at Anfisa of Marzore.

03:16:17 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "You are here as an observer only."

03:16:22 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Another outburst and we will ask you to leave."

03:16:28 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Right, right."

03:16:35 Brandon turns to the three members of the AEU.  "The point, however, is valid."

03:16:58 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Yes, I too agree with sentiment. I say again, speak of practicalities."

03:17:16 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Anyone. Perhaps first one has found his voice."

03:19:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That we abide by the Free Port Doctrinein the least."

03:20:05 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "That is not something up for negotiation."

03:20:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:20:38 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "You will, or you will be fired upon on sight in our sovereign space. Is not offer."

03:20:44 Councilman Brandon Ryland nods to Councilman Aleksei Frolov.

03:24:04 You say, "With or without skim access, the very least we can do is not be in favor of the mutuality being attaked. If the mutuality is attacked on this side of the skims, we would not be able to bring our ships to defeind you. What I'm offering is to defend you on either side of the skims. Without skim acess, that limits our ability to help fight if you do become attacked on this side of the skim."

03:24:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

03:25:57 Chairwoman Candida Doyle helps herself to a white index card from a compact hip pouch.

03:26:12 Chairwoman Candida Doyle puts a white index card on a large ebony table.

03:26:20 --

03:26:21 But it also allows your navy to attack us more easily as well.
--

03:26:50 Aisling glances over at the card and nods.

03:26:52 Aleksei nods gravely. "Yes, I agree with whoever has written these cards that Candida keeps handing out."

03:26:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Can you restrict the QSA to not allow AEU Navy?"

03:28:00 Evangeline shifts on her feet and stares at Lily, saying, "Lily, we have nothing else to offer but what we offered earlier. Nothing."

03:28:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stares at Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

03:28:12 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

03:28:33 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

03:29:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes this is a risk though and if they don't abide by our stern demand that they not attack, this is all that I can suggest."

03:29:54 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

03:30:04 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

03:30:36 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Only if we manually allowed ships through on a case-by-case basis, which is not realistic and not how the accelerators work.  In order to have the entire AEU navy stopped we would need to give the AEU access to the accelerator controls, and we are unwilling to do that."

03:30:57 Lily looks around at the other gracious cCouncil members and apologizes for her fellow aEU pilot.

03:31:07 "That makes sense." You nod to Councilman Brandon Ryland. "I wasn't sure how the skim accelerators worked."

03:31:19 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "And now you say that if they attack you would simply sternly ask them to stop?"

03:31:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Councilman Brandon Ryland.

03:31:43 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "Is this some sort of bad taste joke?"

03:31:45 Aleksei laughs quietly.

03:31:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.

03:32:42 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "I am afraid to ask. I am afraid for the time I will never get back. I am afraid for the woman I may have offended for no good reason to come here. But my conscience drives me."

03:32:47 Aleksei takes a deep breath.

03:33:00 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Is there anything that you have come here prepared to offer? Practically speaking."

03:33:32 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Stern letters and even phone calls do not count."

03:33:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then the counter is that should the AEU Navy perform any action which indicates tht their intentions are hostile, then this would nullify this agreement."

03:34:07 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes, but he said practical Lily. Like a trade or something."

03:34:08 Aleksei pounds a fist on the table. "Of course it would! We would be at war!"

03:34:28 Lily glances at evangeline sternly.

03:34:55 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Out of pure morbid curiosity I have my own question."

03:34:58 Evangeline looks so tired. She just looks down as she is sternly glanced at.

03:35:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Councilman Brandon Ryland.

03:35:07 "Let her speak! I am trusting her grasp on this situation more!" Councilman Aleksei Frolov gestures vaguely at Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

03:35:37 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "Did you discuss these negotiations beforehand?  Did you decide anything before telling us you wanted us to give you access to the accelerators?  Did any of you, did any of the entire group of your pilots, have any plan whatsoever with these negotiations?"

03:35:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes she is more interestedin sleep though than resolving our differences and I do apologize for her."

03:36:30 Lifting up her head, Evangeline says, "If we traded with you, would that accomplish something? Perhaps something you need. We can't trade anything technology wise and I know I know... you didn't say tech..." She stares at Lily, eyes widening as she turns back to Aleksei. "We could give you supplies you need. Perhaps medical. Something that you can use."

03:38:46 Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "Perhaps it would. Perhaps it would not. What is offer?"

03:39:52 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I want to give you medical supplies to help in mutuality space. We can trade them to you for use of your skims. It is a safer bet than what we were talking about with the almost war. Plus, it would help you."

03:41:36 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Better supplies than what EAOS and League and Fringe will be trading to us, or that we can produce ourselves? We are not living in isolated primitive space huts."

03:44:16 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "So far you have offered to do things you would do regardless of any agreement, things you wouldn't do regardless of any agreement, told us that if your alliance declares war on us that you would graciously allow us to have the agreement become null and void, and now you offer us basic medical supplies as if we are in desperate need of help?  This isn't a negotiation, this is a farce."

03:44:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well restoring trade with us would certainly bring you more of an opportunity of commerce???"

03:44:50 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "That would be better for you, not us."

03:45:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "All right then."

03:45:11 Shule glances around at everyone and turning to the council members, he says, "I do apologize. It's elar that we did not adequately prepare  for this meeting."

03:45:19 You say, "Clear."

03:45:22 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Yes, it is."

03:45:51 Councilman Aleksei Frolov exclaims, "Restoring trade? You have had GRAND CYCLES to do that already! That came with diplomatic relations you made no serious attempt at restoring! Now you attempt to attach accelerator access to it!"

03:46:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No sir was just an offer that if our goods were beneficial to you, the it could be amended to the offer."

03:46:33 Chairwoman Candida Doyle helps herself to a white index card from a compact hip pouch.

03:46:38 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Ah yes, the diplomatic relations meeting where your colleagues called us evil psychopaths, if I recall correctly."

03:46:47 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "Or was it supervillains?"

03:49:15 Shule then turns to his fellow AEU pilots and says, "Before wwe waste anymore of these good people's time. Let us go back and if they are kind enough to allow us to meet with them again, we will need to prepare much better."

03:49:37 Chairwoman Candida Doyle puts a white index card on a large ebony table.

03:49:54 Chairwoman Candida Doyle flips a discreet switch on the desk.

03:49:57 Brandon glances at a white index card.

03:49:57 Chairwoman Candida Doyle stands up from a metal conference chair.

03:49:57 Councilman Aleksei Frolov shakes his head.

03:50:01 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "I have to agree with the card."

03:50:05 Councilman Brandon Ryland stands up from a metal conference chair.

03:50:13 Chairwoman Candida Doyle scowls.

03:50:21 --

03:50:22 This was a waste of time. Let's go.
--

03:50:33 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "I guess now I will return to my teams and tell them they do need to continue their work after all."

03:50:39 --

03:50:40 This was a waste of time. Let's go.
--

03:51:03 Chairwoman Candida Doyle helps herself to a white index card from a compact hip pouch.

03:51:09 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Pah. Is good meeting is ending. These people must be tired of standing on feet."

03:51:10 Councilman Aleksei Frolov stands up from a metal conference chair.

03:51:23 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "Yes, that set the tone, didn't it."

03:51:32 Chairwoman Candida Doyle gives a white index card to Councilman Brandon Ryland.

03:51:59 Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "Maybe since you did all the work to get permission for it, it'll be easier to go to the next one?"

03:52:11 Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "But let's go."

03:52:27 Brandon nods curtly at everyone, discarding the card.

03:52:28 Councilman Brandon Ryland puts down a white index card.

03:52:29 Aisling sits quietly and just shakes her head and gives an apologetic look to the council members.

03:52:31 Councilman Brandon Ryland walks down.

03:52:32 Candida sighs and frowns sadly.

03:52:34 Chairwoman Candida Doyle walks down.

03:52:35 Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Come prepared for negotiations, is advice from Uncle Aleksei. Especially ones you have called for urgently. I hope this advice helps in future dealings with others."

03:54:05 Anfisa of Marzore begins clapping slowly.

03:54:12 Evangeline just stands there for a moment, looking as if she may just cry, frustration in her eyes. "Can we go home now?" she asks after a moment, her voice surprisingly steady, "I want to go and shred my face with a paper shredder."

03:54:23 [MTTS] me: No problem.

03:54:35 Aisling says, "Yes. We can leave."

03:54:38 Anfisa of Marzore says, "I have not seen someone choke so hard since that pie eating contest I went to a few grand cycles ago."

03:54:52 Aisling stands up from a metal conference chair.

03:55:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll grab a haul and head home, I suppose."

03:55:25 [MTTS] me: I tried to make it fun. And panicky, but fun, all the same.

03:55:47 Anfisa of Marzore stands up from a metal conference chair.

03:56:05 Anfisa of Marzore braces herself agains the table as she stands.

03:56:21 [MTTS] kaite: Frustrating when one feels as they are going in non-ending circles whereby there is nothing that the opposite side will ever concede to.

03:56:31 Aisling says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Will you be okay? I must take them back."

03:56:53 [MTTS] atherj: Keep it IC!

03:57:23 Anfisa of Marzore says, "Yeah, yeah. Will be fine."

03:57:29 A black digital felo game emits a beep that slowly descends in tone as the felo goes to sleep.

03:57:34 Aisling nods.

04:10:48 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:10:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:10:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:10:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:10:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:11:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:11:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:11:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:11:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:11:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:11:20 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:12:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:12:15 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:12:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Kalina. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:12:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:12:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:12:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:12:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:14:17 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:14:23 Lily rubs your back and comforts you.

04:14:28 You say, "I just had nothing concrete to offer them."

04:14:33 You frown.

04:14:52 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:14:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "What did I do wrong? You don't like me to rub your back anymore?"

04:15:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We needed something from the entire Corps or as many as possible."

04:16:04 You nod.

04:16:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They put the whole issue on our shoulders."

04:16:18 You say, "Yeah, I know."

04:16:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Everything alright Evangeline?"

04:16:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ather didn't even offer anything."

04:16:26 You say, "That wasn't very fair."

04:16:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It truly wasn't."

04:16:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So they will likely blame us that the QSA isn't restored."

04:17:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline through tears, "no it's not all right! What would make you think it was all right? Nothing is all right! You should have been there Eli. You should have. We didn't know what we were doing! We had no idea."

04:17:17 You say, "Oh I'm sure they will."

04:17:19 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:17:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wanted to smack Evangeline. She was so fucking rude."

04:17:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I jsut gave it back to her."

04:17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gasps. "I'm so sorry, Oh no, I was told it was a bad idea for me to come."

04:17:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If you commit to a meeting, you need to commit to its duration."

04:17:57 You nod.

04:18:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh man, I'm sorry Evangeline, are you ok?"

04:18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline continues, "We didn't even have the whereiwthall to prepare for the meeting in question because we were told about it yesterday. Yesterday. Yesterday. Yester fucking day.."

04:18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm sorry. I felt so unprepared."

04:18:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I hope she will never volunteer again."

04:18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I doubt I would have fared much better, but I'm sorry you guys. This sounds like things went really bad."

04:18:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do seriously doubt though that trading with them is more beneficial to us but they have a lot of foolish pride."

04:19:00 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "May I say again, yester fucking day? I... I just.. I... I have no words. I can't... I can't even talk right now. I... I'm just so... I'm so embarrassed. I just... No words. Nada, nothing."

04:20:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's always a show for her and if she can't have her drama..."

04:20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I had nothing concrete to offer them. I'm so sorry I let you all down."

04:20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh man, I'm so sorry, we should have just called the whoel thing off until later."

04:20:36 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:21:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli well you know how they are as I'm sure you've attended their meetings before where they want us to offer and nothing we offer is acceptable yet they never come up with anything concrete in return?"

04:21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline gasps and just sobs, sniffing, "Oh fucking Goddess it was a blood bath and I'll be dreaming about index cards with phraises like... Stern letters are best. And... Stern letters and phonecalls are best. Oh my Goddess. I... I feel like... a piece of paper that has been washed in a washing machine... With scribbled writing on it that is every comment from the mutuality ninth fleet."

04:22:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline takes a deep breath, "But ... I haven't. And they asked me to speak! To speak. I didn't know what the fuck to say but stupid things. I think I insulted the guy who was talking about his lady friend. I was trying to help. I can't do deplomacy..."

04:23:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "However, we do need to sternly request that our navy will not attack the Mutuality and that confirmation be submitted to them. This is about all we could agree on but I do not think this will restore the QSA to us but still, we need to do this."

04:23:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It was when they were asking about trade. I thought if I traded medical supplies it'd be ok... Oh Goddess I'm so dumb... I have not a deplomatic bone in my body and if you ever make me do that again eli I'll cut off your cock and shove it down your throat all the way to the back of your asshole."

04:24:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whoa, I didn' tnkow you felt like I made you do it. You guys volunteered. I'm truly sorry if you felt like I made you do it."

04:24:42 Lily says to you, "Nor you I'll kill her if murder was ever in my bones... if she ever touches you..."

04:25:04 You say to Lily, "No worries. She'll never touch me."

04:25:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And there's no need to apologize Shule, there was little chance that we'd come to an agreement."

04:25:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There was no one else. I... *takes a breath and tries to control the flood of words, but can't*. There was no one else. Everyone else was rogued, constant face was busy."

04:26:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh crap."

04:26:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:27:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's that?"

04:27:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constnatine was going to go by himself, I would have never let you go if I'd known you felt you had no choice Eva, I'll make it up to you.. somehow."

04:27:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:27:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Dakhal you have an interesting sort of humor there."

04:27:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Lily, Shule, you guys alright? You at least don't sound like you are in as bad of shape as Eva."

04:27:52 You say to Lily, "Yeah, Eva will probably offer to have him pay her back in nature."

04:27:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Of course!"

04:28:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:28:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm glad that you approve, Lily."

04:28:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That's how she gets around and always has."

04:28:40 You say to Lily, "Good thing she's never been attracted to me."

04:28:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] After a few breaths in which Evangeline tries to calm down, she says, "It's fine Eli. Truly. Just... I was so embarrassed, and panicked. And they called on me to speak and I don't speak politics well. If it had been art, I would have been all for it, but it was politics. Negociations. I would have given them the fucking red sea if they'd asked of me. I would have given it to them just so they wouldn't ever call on me again. Ever."

04:28:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:28:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well... I always feel rather beatten up when I leave them but each time, it's a little duller feeling because I have learned to never go in with expectations."

04:29:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh so you actually did have some idea of what to expect Lily? At least there's that."

04:29:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:29:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They hate the aEU and always will and they believe they have the upper hand. When there is ever a time someday that they are not so able to be as boastful, we'll see now won't we?"

04:30:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:30:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As I say, I've been down this road before."

04:30:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline nearly gasps, "Well I haven't! Why didn't you warn me! I felt like an insect being analyzed."

04:30:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I truly hope you didn't crash and burn nearly as bad as I did when you went down that road."

04:31:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:31:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We did put tech on the table and only because you guys insisted on it but I knew they could have cared less but you all had to learn for yourselves."

04:31:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well we don't have much to really offer them, not really. We're the ones that want access so they seem to hold the cards there."

04:31:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We don't have shit to offer them. If we did we would have gone in there prepared, but as it stands, I can't shut up now. Goddess Evangeline shut up."

04:32:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:32:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's what I am saying. However the card we do hold is that we need to affirm that the aEU Navy will not attact them during non-aggressive times."

04:32:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:32:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Only if this is to merely save our face."

04:32:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Do you think they'll listen? I don't. I wanted to say something but I couldn't. I was just that freaked out. I... just... I... I'm going to drink now. Like wine. Wine is good. And we aren't saving our face. We're cutting it to pieces."

04:33:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:33:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wine is good and as I have said to you Evangeline, I've been there before and I knew what to expect and if we don't affirm that we son't attack, we're doing nothing at all."

04:33:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:33:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Won't that is."

04:34:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok maybe I shouldn't keep trying to talk on comms right now, I keep miscomming the worst things."

04:36:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

04:36:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's true."

04:36:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm just.. at a loss here. I didn' tthink it would go well, but I wasn't expecting you guys to be so upset."

04:36:24 You say, "Well, at least they didn't rake my name over the coals."

04:36:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is one time when I agree with the media."

04:36:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or for it to be that bad."

04:37:35 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:37:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline sounds a little calmer now. "It is all right. If Lily can convence the government that no attacks are good attacks, perhaps I can stop sounding like a sarcastic prude. In any case, I'm done blowing up the communicator. I think I got all my anger and humiliation out all in one channel."

04:37:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:37:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I won't make any apologies here."

04:38:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:38:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "'Laughs wryly."

04:38:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."

04:38:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:38:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Laughs wryly

04:38:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, OOCly, "I always screw those up."

04:38:58 You say, OOCly, "Yeah, me too."

04:39:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If things are not worse than before, then it sounds like you guys did fine to me."

04:39:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:39:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh I appreciate your always looking to the brighter side Eli!"

04:39:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I sure as hell don't feel like I did fine, but thanks."

04:39:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:39:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also Eli I have some things for you and Constantine. I will catch up with you soon I hope."

04:40:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline laughs softly. "It's fine Eli. We are fine, I suppose, though I think my pride suffered more than anything. Next time, I want to bring my own index cards."

04:40:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They had index cards?"

04:40:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:40:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eriously and dump them all over the table filled with jokes."

04:40:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:40:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Seriously."

04:40:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup... Yup... candita... yup."

04:40:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:40:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I was so tempted to sweep them into the nearest waste basket."

04:41:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:41:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But no I would never be that disrespectful but talk about rude?"

04:41:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No comment. I'm just... gona calm down now."

04:42:50 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:43:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

04:44:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

04:44:55 Lily says to you, "Was the quilt on your mat ok?"

04:45:30 You say to Lily, "Oh,m it was great! Thank you so so much!"

04:46:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You're welcome. It was hard to chose the colors for the quilt as I jsut wasn't sure."

04:46:57 "You chose well!" You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:47:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

04:48:18 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:48:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I didn't want to cut Evangeline off as I felt she had to have the opportunity to offer something but just shows how little she knows about the Mutuality."

04:48:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

04:48:30 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:48:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know she wanted to keep quiet too so it's not her fault."

04:48:51 You nod.

04:50:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I think that I'm pretty screwed."

04:50:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What happened?"

04:51:43 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Mutuality."

04:51:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "My controls locked up and some IFS got a good fair number of potshots on me. Currently my hull is at 96% and everything else is totaled."

04:52:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Where are you?"

04:52:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "All the way out in 777."

04:52:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh dear. It'd take me a while to get out there."

04:52:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Tr 1 can you land on anything or go out of the sector you should be able to as they do not interdict."

04:52:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:52:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Can you land on anything or go out of the sector you should be able to as they do not interdict."

04:52:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Can you at least dock?"

04:53:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He should just go out of the sector and stay put so we can go take care of it."

04:53:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's dumb to allow that to happen but they panic."

04:53:43 You say, "I know."

04:53:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

04:54:04 You say, "I should probably head out there. You're welcome to come if you'd like."

04:54:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will."

04:54:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:54:17 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:54:21 You hold Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's hand, taking her into your group.

04:54:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:54:24 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

04:54:25 You exit the ship.

04:54:25 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

04:54:28 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

04:54:28 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:54:29 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

04:54:29 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

04:54:30 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

04:54:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:54:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:54:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:54:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:54:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:54:45 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 642" has jumped into the sector.

04:54:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:54:48 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 642! Welcome to home space!"

04:54:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh for fuck's goddamn mother fucking... god... fucking christ."

04:54:57 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:54:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:55:00 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

04:55:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:55:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:55:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:55:05 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

04:55:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:55:11 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to Mir."

04:55:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So go out of the sector or dock Ifs do not interdict so always do either and don't allow yourself to be blown up."

04:55:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Can I get oe gunner?"

04:55:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "One."

04:55:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Hmm?"

04:56:06 You say, "Was just asking for one gunner, but never mind."

04:56:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Never mind."

04:56:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I can gun repairs will just have to wait."

04:56:17 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 5,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

04:56:17 [Enter `yes' or `no']

04:56:18 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

04:56:18 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 694,217.69 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 777. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

04:56:19 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:56:29 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:56:30 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:56:31 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:56:32 You say, "Nah, I can gun. I may need you to keep laser resists up."

04:56:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ouch."

04:56:40 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

04:57:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:57:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It will take over a half hour for us to get out to 777 so go out of the sector and stay put if you haven't docked."

04:57:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We're on our way."

04:57:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Oh you don't have a rift drive on this?"

04:57:52 You say, "I do."

04:57:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh hmm."

04:58:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Can you tell ushow amny IFS were there?"

04:59:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I mean, tell us how many IFS were there?"

05:12:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "You just did and that is not what I said."

05:12:17 [Starship "Firestorm"; Weapons Room]

05:12:17 You see a swiveling dark gray leather gunner's chair here.
You can go down.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

05:12:19 You turn general communication on.

05:12:21 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

05:12:21 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

05:12:30 You say, "Oops."

05:12:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You know I didn't say that."

05:12:40 You say, "Forgot you were still following me."

05:12:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I never said anything aabout vengance."

05:12:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's not qu~te what wa|+_a=[, I'" just going to stop try%n> &? offer [n &xplanation before they end u: twisting my ?or@s too and just/making things worse."

05:12:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Did I?"

05:12:54 You say, "I know."

05:13:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I did say they have the upper hand."

05:13:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And there's nothing wrong with that but I am not into vengance at all."

05:13:42 I don't see that here.

05:13:49 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What the fuck, who want#d th% m_)ti.g;in!the first $lace?"

05:13:58 "I know." You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "It's just what the news has been doing to us."

05:14:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Shut the fuck up cheri you don't know the real truth behind that."

05:14:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course I know none of you will back me up."

05:14:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

05:15:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Mostly m@ and {onstant*ne, wi,h a suggestio* from Ather."

05:15:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We ;ere ,pset whe^"we read the headl)n* ab=ut th; coun\ilwoman bei?g supr-ied and saying the AEU di=n'* even$b;t*er to send=anyo.e+"

05:15:53 You say to Lily, "I know you didn't say anything about vengeance."

05:15:53 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So t|en the meeting }app#n^, a(d let's just g$? t_?the im($rt'nt*%:rt. >ou weren') |eady, you d+dn't have : deal to put on the table."

05:16:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "What I said was They hate the aEU and always will and they believe they have the upper hand. When there is ever a time someday that they are not so able to be as boastful, we'll see now won't we?"

05:16:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That did not say anything about vengance."

05:16:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "D:d you guys*tr~ offering the battery?}The> didn't wan{}th/t?"

05:17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "_e can't?ma>e offers like that if ]ur governm\/t #oes^'t want",t."

05:17:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And it was sug="st~d we di-*+t,-bu@ I wanted to {ffer the r'vo."

05:17:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So ar eyou just going to sit back and let them beat me up?"

05:18:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I sure do not want vengance and I have no reason to."

05:19:02 You say, "No, I'm justwaiting until our comms are clearer."

05:19:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "As I said, I'm not trying to toss blame around as has been stated, only trying to offer an explanation."

05:19:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I only meant that they are so boastful because they think they will never need us for anything."

05:19:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is all."

05:19:32 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I know."

05:19:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

05:20:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just shouldn't have been as strong as we can't even trust our own media."

05:20:11 You say, "No, we can't."

05:25:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We need to teach our pilots how to deal with these. I remember starting out, there were Ifs and pirates around all of the time and they jsut can't allow themselves to get blown up or act like fraidy cats."

05:25:57 You say, "Yeah, we do."

05:26:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They need to get out of the sector and wait and they can."

05:26:12 You nod.

05:26:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or land if they can but having us come all the way out here is rediculous."

05:26:31 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

05:33:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Less than a minute."

05:33:34 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

05:33:47 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

05:33:47 Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer reports that the aether "Researcher 625" has jumped out of the sector.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:34:35 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "It's clear."

05:34:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah I see that haha."

05:34:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

05:34:48 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "That was a researcher."

05:34:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know. Teach me to be deplomatic. I want to learn how to do it so I won't fuck up next time. I want to learn to be a p.. politicion."

05:34:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And you guys don't need to worry about that, I'l handle it. You guys did your best with what you had."

05:35:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No you shouldn't have to handle it alone. We should help you."

05:35:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "777 clear."

05:35:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:35:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not me I dislike politics. That is not what I went to the university to learn."

05:35:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm cleary a terrible diplomat and politician."

05:35:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:35:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes we needed more time to deal with this yet they blamed us for stalling."

05:36:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "I went to school to become a pilot." Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "That is all I went for. Now, I must learn something different than piloting. Politicing."

05:36:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:36:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

05:36:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

05:36:31 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 776. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

05:36:31 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:36:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:36:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good then I need to learn to be mean, hateful and vengeful."

05:36:41 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:36:41 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:36:42 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:36:44 The starship has left a unique area of space.

05:36:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "Wait want to check on our guy?"

05:36:52 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

05:36:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awww, love. You are not engeful."

05:37:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Vengeful."

05:37:04 You say, "Oh."

05:37:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline sighs softly. "Never mind. I'm going to bed. you have fun learning how to be mean Lily."

05:37:08 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

05:37:11 You press a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.

05:37:12 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel cancelled."

05:37:13 You say, "Sure."

05:37:17 "77" does not match any known sector.

05:37:20 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 777."

05:37:21 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:37:31 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:37:31 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:37:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:37:32 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:37:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No I'd rather not I'll leave that to others."

05:37:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Night."

05:37:40 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

05:37:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Night Eva."

05:37:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:38:45 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

05:38:45 Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.

05:38:47 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:08:08 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:08:18 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:08:19 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

06:08:19 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:08:21 The starship has left a unique area of space.

06:08:27 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

06:08:29 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

06:08:31 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

06:08:37 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

09:55:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What a premier artifacting ship, though. By the time I've got enough points to lead an expedition, I won't really have any need for one."

09:56:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, it' sgot sub-warp. So I'm guessing for artifacting, it probably can't be beat."

09:56:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

09:56:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Mike Breedlove transmits, "Sounds like it was a damn fine ship. Shame it's no longer available."

11:11:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, there's Nouveau Quebec, which is actually less than a day, I suppose that counts. Though that will be harder to get to without accesss to the skims. Still doable, but harder."

11:12:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or do you mean like, places to artifact and stuff?"

11:13:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Once I can get a ship with a bigger battery, of course."

11:13:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. you can also just head out in a direction and try to find new things."

11:13:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true, I figured any location I can reach in a day would probably already have been found, though."

11:13:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that not the case?"

11:14:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's always possible to discover new things."

13:04:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:04:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:04:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:04:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:05:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:05:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:05:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:05:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

13:05:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:05:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:05:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:05:28 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:05:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

13:05:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:05:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:05:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:05:33 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

13:05:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:05:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:05:57 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:06:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

13:06:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:06:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:06:15 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:06:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

18:16:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

18:16:23 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:27:10 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

18:27:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

18:27:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

18:27:43 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

18:34:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

18:34:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

18:34:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:34:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:34:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:34:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:34:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:34:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

18:34:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:34:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

18:34:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:34:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:34:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:34:59 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:35:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

18:35:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:35:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:35:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:35:04 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:35:07 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

18:35:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

18:35:10 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

18:35:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:35:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:35:41 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

18:35:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

18:35:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:35:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:35:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

18:35:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:36:02 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:36:43 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.
