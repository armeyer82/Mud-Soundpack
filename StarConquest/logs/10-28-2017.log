00:43 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Twenty-four days into the term, here is the state of the corps! AEU pilots have completed 17 out of 111 total beacon drops, which according to the figures from last week, is not really much of a step up! We have also destroyed 5 out of 13 total destroyed RATS nests, which is pretty decent. Lastly, we've managed to complete the only salvage op that has been completed this term, and we've only hauled in 130 out of 1220 total hauled asteroids, which I believe was the number from last week, so that number may not have changed, but I don't remember. No new planets have been recorded as discovered so far in the current term. [20:34 27 October 2317 GST]

06:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I only said it again to emphasize the point."

06:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I don't know. Maybe the repetativeness, to it? Or, maybe just how it was said?"

20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How are you trying to raise that, Katie?"

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Are you doing svp missions, or just seeking rats?"

20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Just seeking rats. I did do an svp mission, but that is now done."

20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "It's tesla times!"

20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, hmm. I guess the real way to do something about that is beacons, maybe later."

20:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Indeed. I've not tried the easy beacons on my own, nor do I think I really should, but beacons I've done only once."

20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Is it fun?"

20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Perhaps I should again?"

20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie sounding almost dismissive, though perhaps not meaning too: they're alright

20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "I think I understand..."

20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, beacons are fun, but I would not do them solo, hmm, or maybe if you feel really very confident in a rental ship?"

20:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And although they are fun to do, never forget we are doing serious work with them."

20:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Of course not, 'll never forget that."

20:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, agreed with what Lily said."

20:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If a ship lands that is infeected with bari, and your ship is powered up, there is a very,  very high chance it will spread to your ship."

20:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Thanks, will go there later, when done mining on tesla."

20:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The actual chance of that happeneing is lowish, but if it does,  having more ships infected will escalate the problem."

20:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I'm aware. I meant how come you're mentioning it? I might have forgotten maybe once... It's not something I make a habit of. Usually if its up and empty, its because I'm running down to repair and rearm."

20:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, folks are just cautious. There's always that chance you didn't know."

20:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie slowly, I see

20:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There is a book in the Conference Room of the office Building concerning the seriousness of Bari. It is a good read as well as other books in the Library case on the table there."

20:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie transmits, her tone carefully calm, madam Kaise, I appreciate your concern, but I do not need a lecture on bari. I am quite aware of what they can do.

20:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup made it to 20k Industry I hope I never have to do that again!"

20:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

20:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hmm... did you get anything special? I mean besides just the increase in industry based stuff."

20:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Gees, 20 k industry... it will take me another 3 years if not more to get there."

20:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Did you unlock long-ranged laser grapple?"

20:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, grappel from 10 units away, I wish..."

20:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Naa still see the Mighty VI here ah well! Guess I'll go check Belt Management but those are at odd values and doubt there's anything above the Ultra driller or whatever that is."

20:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You rpboably now have the option to replace all your workers with robots."

20:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Woo!"

20:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Maybe I should start one too."

20:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "So um."

20:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I could do with... that help you offered."

20:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, help, with what again?"

20:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Well, you see."

20:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I might be.... dead in the water. as in, out of charge, in space."

21:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "In a bubble... I feel like a freekin' hamster."

21:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, do you have a charge booster on you?"

21:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie after the sounds of rummaging through a handbag, nope.

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The bubble you are in should contain a reset function, look around you for that. It gives you about 10 minutes of charge. Just enough to jump to new earth or providence gate at least."

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Okey dokey."

21:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "2 minutes left... come on, come on, get to providdance, come on!"

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Where are you now?"

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Providdance."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Do you have enough charge to make it?"

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I've landed and its recharging."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey everybody."

21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good, now get 2 things. A few charge boosters, at least 3 and a spacesuit, in case this happens again."

21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Constantine."

21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Stone man! The nest man1 me love you long time if you run nest."

21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie giggles

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And try not to let that happen again. Spinward cluster is not particularly safe, if a pirate or ifs ship hops in, you do not stand much of a chance."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Won't happen again. I was just very distracted, and this is my first time flying this ship."

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "We all learn by doing mistakes."

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not upset with you, just said it for your own protection and well being out there."

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, we do."

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Indeed."

21:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Not sure I'm a fan of our fighter."

21:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, is it out?"

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmmm?"

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, do you just mean the mark 3 fighter?"

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I t/in{`she means the reg]$ar one."

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well a fighter is not a long-range starship and it's built for compactness so one needs to just observe their power gage."

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Mhm. I meant the little cadet buyable fighter."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I dunno. It's not so much the power that's bugging me out. It just seems... I dunno... disappointing, somehow."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's pretty solid for what it is. Though if we ever get those patriots I'll use one of those instead."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Nope. Definitely prefer golden dawn."

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That very fighter most of us keep as our stock fighter as once it's upgraded it is very usefuul and always will be."

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Useful that is."

21:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I do have time to lead a nest is people are interested."

21:29 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "I am a bit confused. When in an asteroid site, how do you get information, how much metal there is at your current position?"

21:29 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Are you asteroid mining?"

21:29 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Type summery."

21:29 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "The metal isn't really in any one spot."

21:29 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "The site as a whole just has it, and yeah, use summary to see how much is left."

21:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Mmm."

21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey."

21:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey, how are you?"

21:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think regular."

21:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Me too."

21:33 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ooh, back to back bari."

21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Booom."

21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

21:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Doing alright.. growing impatient."

21:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "With?"

21:49 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "How do you kill the poacher drones?"

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Thought I would've had my full license by now.."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I know the feeling."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Poacher drones, where?"

21:50 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Any drones that aren't doing other tasks will do it, so will defense buildings."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, wha, never mind me."

21:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

21:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I am most impressed with my new battlesuit weapon."

21:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Duel laser pistels. Probably tiny to everyone else, but its very nice."

21:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I remember them, they were nice."

21:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It's been quite a while since I used them."

21:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Wish they could kill poachers."

22:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, dual lasers?"

22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I am curious. Is there a charge to be obtained to help with the destruction of transmission towers? Or is it a case of lasering the hell out of them."

22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Just a case of lasering the hell out of them."

22:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Mm kay."

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't remember but I might have lobbed a detonator at those once or twice."

22:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Still I believe lasers are about the best choice."

22:08 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Anyone interested in either a nest or some beacons?"

22:08 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Me."

22:08 [Tactical Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Sure."

22:15 [Tactical Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "On route now."

22:30 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Kert... commands are ooc, mayun."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you word it right, you can do it icly."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Well, a button press would qualify as a command, to my way of thinking."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Exactly."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I called it a command though."

22:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I asked if there's a command to request the tracking array to repeat what it's tracking."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Enter the command on your console to fire the minicannons sounds totally ICly to me."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Right. I just thought your wording was a bit close to the line is all."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ehh...I wouldn't sweat that."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah just referr to it as a button or something displayed on a terminal where applicable."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Newbie isn't the place for critiquing roleplay though."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "To answer your question though, no there isn't."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What is the place for it? And ok. Thanks."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Sorry! I shall now be quiet. Actually, Quick question. Chainguns, is the command chain?"

22:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yes, and mini is mini."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Can be shortened as much as ch."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Thank ya."

22:33 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can shorten it all the way to ch if that's more your thing."

22:33 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "That's useful I've been typing chain."

22:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "And to answer your question Kert, there really isn't. It isn't our place to critique others' RP."

22:33 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "CH will work? I've been having to use cha. Maybe I have an old alias from another game setup that I didn't realize."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ch works, yes."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "CHA works as well, yes."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "But yeah. Ch is the shortest for chainguns."

22:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am confused, why do we have to read the book on genetic experimentation before we go bari cleansing?"

22:49 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the six-person pincer "Some Jerk Shot This Nameplate Making It Illegible".

22:51 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "When asteroid mining, can you buy an extra drone?"

22:51 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yes, you can build more."

22:51 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can, build drone factories."

22:51 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Julius, I'd recommend sitting down with another character that does asteroid mining. Might make it a bit easier."

22:52 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, research drone replicator then build that, after that you can build more drones with it. You can only have as many drones as your towers can control though."

22:52 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "I know, actually not my question, I asked: can you buy one?"

22:52 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."

22:52 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, you can only get more by researching and then building the factories."

22:52 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Everything is paid for with metals and has to be built somehow."

22:52 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Oh my, will stay here for weeks, but thanks *smiles*."

22:53 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "It should really not take that long."

22:53 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I said to sit down with another character who mines."

22:54 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Wouldn't help. 4 tasks, but only 3 drones."

22:54 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Most mines don't take more than four hours or so. Early mines, much less than that. Right now there's no book on the market, so sitting down with someone is the best way."

22:54 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is a solution to that."

22:55 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Thanks friend. I'll find it, and my mentor, if it ever gets online."

22:55 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It can be handled icly is what I'm telling you. Just ask someone on general or your alliance channel."

22:56 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Np, I have the time."
