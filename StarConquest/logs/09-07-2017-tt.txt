Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a short-sleeved baby blue and white striped v-neck tee and a
pair of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on
the back left pocket. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a
perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and
both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk
of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" in her right hand.

Date November 9, 2316
Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200.
At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to
an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500
Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the
Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days
and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be
back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have
returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations.
I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs
to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station
when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this
purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar
favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

Lily:
For the last few weeks you have been saying repeatedly that there is nothing
more important than stopping Outccord negotiations and getting the AEU back on
track. However, on September 5, when we asked you to join the protest that we
were holding as an attempt to encourage the government to stop Outccord
negotiations, you chose to replace a temporary beacon rather than assist your
fellow pilots. Your choices not only infuriated me, but infuriated all of the
other pilots who were present. All of the other pilots who witnessed your true
feelings about the alliance that you claimed to love.
The issue is not so much that you just flat out refused to attend the protest.
it's that for the longest time, as I said earlier, you have been preaching about
how important it is for the AEU to remain in the Accord, and to get back to the
way it was. Yet when we ask you to help with it, you choose to sit back, go
restore the temporary beacon to some stupid artifacting and salvage site, rather
than actually help us with our efforts. You need to figure out where your
priorities lie. Until then, I requested from all organizations that they revoke
your access to all of their warehouses, and stop using your organization's
station parts for the foreseeable future. Odds are, when you get this letter, we
will still be protesting. You can jump on comms, jump on the boards, and
transmit or write one of your usual rants. I am curious to see how it will be
received by members of other alliances, who chose to attend this protest over
working and setting up temporary stations. Unlike you, a member of the AEU who
chose to set up temporary stations, over supporting your own alliance.
Take care:
Ather
