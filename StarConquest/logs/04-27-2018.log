02:25 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

02:26 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Bouncy bouncy."

02:26 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:26 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "That's what she said."

02:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:26 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:27 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Kani Kahakai's neck.

02:28 Kani pokes her tongue out at Melinda.

02:41 Morris says to Hawthorn, "Bit over 30 LTC, if that helps."

02:41 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

02:43 Morris Corlew nods.

02:46 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn navigates his slate blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:46 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

02:46 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

02:46 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We fell Morris. Did you break your toosh?"

02:47 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:47 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:47 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Think it might actually be less. Didn't we travel 5 ltcs from the last posting and then another uh... what are we at eight?"

02:47 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:47 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:47 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

02:48 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "What about your antlers? If any broke I'd like one to decorate my starship. Will be beautiful."

02:48 Morris says to Hawthorn, "Last check was at the pre-stellar. 38.9 LTC to go."

02:48 Morris says to Hawthorn, "Don't look like it got put on the boards."

02:48 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh that was it? I thought we checked before that."

02:48 Morris Corlew says, "We did."

02:48 Morris Corlew says, "But there's too many stops I can't member 'em all. So I just use the last one. It's more accurate anyways."

02:49 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ah, and so from that posting we've traveled eight ltcs so only 30 to go then."

02:49 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Or sorta."

02:49 Morris Corlew nods.

02:49 Morris Corlew says, "Close enough."

02:49 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "That's not...so bad."

02:49 Morris Corlew grins at FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn.

02:50 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:50 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "...what's Andy's?"

02:50 Morris Corlew says, "Oh...bad frame of reference, sorry."

02:50 Morris Corlew frowns.

02:50 Gonzales says to Hawthorn, "Come on it's just 52 more years to go."

02:50 Morris Corlew says, "Andy's Tradin Post."

02:50 Morris Corlew says, "300 light-years south of Campeche."

02:50 Hawthorn says to Gonzales, "I'm gonna die by then I'm 23 right now."

02:50 You say to Hawthorn, "It's a trading post in the middle of nowhere."

02:50 You grin.

02:50 Nissi Valdaire says, "Andy's is a little old place where we can get together."

02:51 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh. Well, huh."

02:51 Morris Corlew chuckles at Nissi Valdaire.

02:51 You grin at Nissi Valdaire.

02:51 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Someone said that's where they get all the lizards."

02:51 Morris says to Nissi, "Just don't uh...bang bang bang on the door..."

02:51 Morris says to Hawthorn, "That area, yeah."

02:51 Nissi Valdaire grins.

02:51 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh."

02:51 You grin.

02:52 Morris Corlew says, "I think they've mostly been Tom Town and Feng Wo. Not sure if anybody's traded for one at Andy's."

02:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Cesar."

02:52 Morris Corlew says, "Ah, cool."

02:52 You say, "I was just going to say I think Cesar."

02:52 Morris Corlew nods.

02:52 Morris Corlew says, "Which...one was Cesar's? I almost forgot he had one."

02:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Sold it to Natalia."

02:52 Morris Corlew says, "Well...I did forget actually."

02:52 Morris Corlew says, "Oh that one."

02:53 Morris Corlew says, "That's right. I member that now."

02:53 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Athena is it's name."

02:53 Morris Corlew says, "Wonder how them two're enjoyin retired life."

02:54 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah they have great meat dogs and beer."

04:18 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll fly us in."

04:44 FCI Scout Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:44 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides south.

04:45 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

04:45 A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:45 Morris Corlew lopes south.

04:46 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

04:47 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

04:47 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

04:49 The voice of Morris Corlew comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "On my way back."

04:51 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

05:07 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:07 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:07 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:07 The starship has left a unique area of space.

05:07 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

05:09 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sleeping a while."

05:37 Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face backwards.

05:47 Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other, tortured bodies straining with the effort.

05:58 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

06:08 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

06:08 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

06:08 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

06:27 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

06:38 A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

06:48 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

06:59 Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

07:09 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

07:09 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

07:30 The tingling of your nerves subsides slightly into warm pressure.

07:40 Your nerves tingle pleasantly with every pulse of the colors surrounding the ship.

07:48 A sudden blinding flash sets your nerves afire! Your pleasure nearly peaks!

07:53 The colors begin to throb and flash wildly -- each flash sending a mild frisson of pain through your body, strangely not unpleasant when accompanied by the warm pleasure of the colors themselves.

07:53 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

07:53 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

08:10 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

08:10 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

08:11 The wind gusts, and the hovertruck wavers back and forth, barely under control.

09:03 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

09:03 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello."

09:36 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

09:37 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

09:39 An allied mortar strike decimates the enemy forces to the cheer of allied comrades, clearing a path to advance.

09:39 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

09:40 Enemy reinforcements flood the battlefield, causing allied soldiers to fall back.

10:01 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

10:02 The hull creaks and buckles as another ant grasps the ship in its mandibles, taking control of carrying it in a new direction.

10:02 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

10:03 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

10:03 A small stream of rainwater catches the ant carrying the ship, and while it holds on, it and the ship are quickly washed down the rivulet!

10:03 The ant carrying the ship manages to pull itself out of the water and back to drier land.

10:39 The ant carrying the ship manages to pull itself out of the water and back to drier land.

10:41 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

10:42 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

10:50 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

10:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

10:58 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

11:03 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

11:03 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

11:05 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:13 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

11:13 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

11:14 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:22 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:54 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

11:55 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

12:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:04 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

12:05 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

12:05 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

12:15 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

12:26 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

12:56 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

12:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:06 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

13:06 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

13:06 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

13:07 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

13:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

13:08 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

13:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:19 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

13:24 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

13:24 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

13:24 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

13:24 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

13:29 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

13:30 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

13:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:42 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not sure if we're supposed to go to them. Was it ever cleared with ups?"

13:42 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Planetary systems."

14:06 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

14:06 A pair of stars orbit together here around their combined center of mass. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Planets in binary systems are generally not large and are in unstable orbits, but a few small rocky planets may exist.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

14:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides out.

14:23 Listen. You need to be careful.

14:23 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How many planets?"

14:23 FCI Scout Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How many planets if any were discovered?"

14:23 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Two."

14:23 FCI Scout Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo and thanks! The info down here doesn't reflect that."

14:24 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Neat."

14:24 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the west.

14:26 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Time to jump."

14:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:32 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's true."

14:33 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Forgot that part."

14:33 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Forgot what part?"

14:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:39 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

14:39 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

14:39 The starship has left a unique area of space.

14:39 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

14:41 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning."

14:42 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Howdy."

14:44 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the west.

14:52 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We aren't checking course till we've gone half way or stop for more planets. Y'all got that?"

14:52 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

14:52 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Works for me."

14:52 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup. Jib adds 900 speed, want it up?"

14:52 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure."

14:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

15:09 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

15:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:20 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

15:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

15:26 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

15:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:36 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

15:40 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

15:40 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

15:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:51 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

15:52 You remove a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots from a leather briefcase.

Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a sparkly ouija board, a medium-sized crystal ball, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.
Ryan Thomas is
18:06  sleeping on a charcoal gray velvet sofa.
Keegan Wantz is standing here. Ali Candan is sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

18:06 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We'll be holding there while Ian does some scans, and waiting for a solid crew to be up and at 'em. Which I've been told is typically between 2200 and midnight for you guys, so that's what we'll aim for on whichever day we get there."

18:07 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sounds good."

18:07 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup, typically."

18:07 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok."

18:07 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Makes sense."

18:08 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "From what I hear, it's not looking like that'll be tonight, though I guess we could get lucky."

18:08 Ali Candan glances down at his watch momentarily.

18:09 Ali Candan says into the PA microphone, "We'll be there in 10 hours or so, so probably not."

18:09 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "To clarify, if we arive at our destination at say 3, we sit tight till we get the go ahead which will likely be between 2200 and midnight."

18:09 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right."

18:10 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sounds like a good plan."

18:10 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So we might be holding for most of a day, but that'll give us plenty of time for analysis and for you guys to prepare yourselves."

18:10 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sounds good."

18:10 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Any questions about any of that?"

18:10 You say to a pair of white cotton briefs, "Not that I can think of."

18:11 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shall we yell across to the other ship or will one of your team be informing them?"

18:11 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Not that I can think of."

18:11 A sudden gust of cold air blows through the starship bringing the scents of stone and ancient, moldering flesh.

18:12 Ali Candan says into the PA microphone, "Do you have any guesses to if we would get attacked in this staging point?"

18:12 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, go ahead and pass along the word, would you? Ellen might tell them herself later, too, just to be able to answer their questions."

18:13 Ali Candan says into the PA microphone, "Since we'll most likely end up floating in there."

18:13 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We will be stopping around two light-years from our destination and not be seeing anything on our computers so we don't have people trying to go in early. We'll likely be going in when a good number of people are usually alert. This is between 22:00 and midnight. So we may be sitting tight for the better part of a day."

18:13 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We have no idea, but the Outsiders certainly know where it is. That's why we're loaded for bear."

18:13 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I guess we might want to sit there with a reduced signature? Yellow alert and all that?"

18:13 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "That sounds like a good plan. Though hell through temptation."

18:14 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And anticipation."

18:14 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Any questions?"

18:14 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, they don't know where the staging point is, that's just an arbitrary point we put in your computer, but they'll be able to find us if anybody takes a good look."

18:15 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "How much farther do you think?"

18:15 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure is convenient that we've been spotted by a patrol not a day ago."

18:15 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Powering stuff down might be an idea. Yellow alert might be too much of a strain on the battery. We do want to make it back home, too."

18:15 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Keep in mind that just being out of the rift will reduce your signature significantly."

18:15 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Depending on flow, I figure we'll make it sometime after 2 or 3."

18:16 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Let's pray for another storm that knocks are arival time up by a couple hours."

18:16 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not sure I'd want to power down navigation though."

18:17 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Or sensors."

18:17 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Need comms for the rift link, too."

18:17 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just keep sensors up. We'll stay patched in and let you know if there's incoming. Assuming we don't have to fight it out the moment we get there."

18:18 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Works for me."

18:18 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks, Jim."

18:18 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Can we know what happens after?"

18:19 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Make sure Pierre gets the information."

18:19 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Write it on your chest and flash him."

18:19 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Depends on what we see. We'll try to achieve long-range communication, then attempt a landing, then make contact. That would complete all our objectives."

18:20 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "About 15.5 ltc's left, right?"

18:20 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Roughly."

18:21 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Landing, yes, I am assuming all six EAOS techs will be on the initial landing team and that we need to go small with the rest of the crew numbers of the team unless we get some sort of word that we are all good to go?"

18:22 There is a sudden squeak from somewhere inside the starship, cut off with a crunch and the sound of scuttling legs.

18:24 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We'll play it by ear. If we're still not sure what we're heading into by the time we land, I'll just take Ellen and Georgie. You pick your team, and if anything about it doesn't seem like a good idea, believe me, I'll let you know."

18:25 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Zro Des Cartes/General.

18:25 Ali Candan switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

18:25 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You guys can see the post I just added, correct?"

18:25 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

18:25 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes."

18:25 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks."

18:25 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Is that sufficient?"

18:27 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So, let's assume we make contact. What's the objective there? Play a round of Horrible People or two and go?"

18:28 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "That's good."

18:29 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We start simple, kid. The objective is to establish communication without shooting at each other, exchange pleasantries, and see if they're amenable to future contact. Then we go home with whatever we've found out. We're just information-gathering."

18:33 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

18:33 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm pretty interested in how we're going to try and establish communication! I mean, from a technical standpoint, I guess. Radio signals? Complicated aerial starship figures? I have no idea."

18:35 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We'll try the hypercaster from the staging point, though that's kind of a long shot. We'll try radio once we're in orbit."

18:37 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Neat, neat. What if they engage us? I mean, one of our ships IS an Outsider hybrid. Should we just hold our fire and try to de-escalate through overwhelming demonstrations of pacifism?"

18:37 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do you advise people not be messing with the hypercasters until we are ready?"

18:37 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I can see someone doing it unless advised not to do so."

18:38 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, we can try to talk them down, but if they're firing shots right away, our only reasonable course is to disengage and start back home. We're not here to start a war."

18:38 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And, yeah, please don't hypercast anything out that way until we're ready."

18:39 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, like I said, the stealth galleon might look like an Outsider vessel at a first glance. Misunderstandings and everything!"

18:40 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The important thing here is to not move too fast. Don't get greedy. Believe me, I know. I've set foot on dozens of unexplored planets. I lost my best friend to a Spotted Froghawk. No one takes this more seriously than me."

18:40 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow. Sorry, man."

18:41 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Also, do not mess with the hypercasters while sitting at our point until we are ready to begin communication attempts. We will be informed when that will begin. To clarify, no dicking around with hypercasting."

18:41 Ryan Thomas suddenly awakens.

18:42 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I see. Sorry for your loss. What are the most important things to do or keep in mind when landing on an unexplored planet? I think all of us could use your expertise there."

18:42 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah. If we ever find our way back to Jinu space... I'm gonna find that Spotted Froghawk. And I will kill it."

18:42 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aww man, sorry to hear that."

18:42 Ryan Thomas stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

18:42 Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "Hello."

18:42 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Roast Spotted Froghawk."

18:42 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You forgot no pinging."

18:42 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ryan, read Cartes general message from Goss. It'll get you up to speed quick."

18:43 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Add that in too."

18:43 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

18:43 Ryan Thomas navigates his black touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:43 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

18:43 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah. Listen, it's been real."

18:44 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I don't doubt it."

18:44 Keegan Wantz switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

18:44 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Zro Des Cartes/General.

18:46 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Aha. I will spacewalk to the Fwoof-Foom planet!"

18:47 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

18:47 Keegan Wantz strides south.

18:49 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "If anyone asks, this no hypercast information came from Jim upon my asking about it. So, I am not just throwing stuff at y'all according to what I think ought to be done."

18:49 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "All right."

18:49 Ali Candan switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

18:50 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Jimm's the boss. It's sensible."

18:51 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

18:51 Constantine Stone says, "Hey."

18:51 Constantine Stone sits down.

18:52 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

18:54 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Poor Ian's going to be scanning for a long time."

18:54 Ali Candan says to Constantine, "Check the boards for information if you haven't."

18:54 Constantine Stone navigates his plain touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:55 Constantine Stone switches a plain touch einrophone off.

18:56 Constantine Stone says, "Ah ha, interesting."

18:56 Constantine Stone says, "I will have comfortably settled into my weekend slumber by then."

18:56 Constantine Stone chuckles.

19:00 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

19:04 You wave to Constantine Stone.

19:05 Ryan Thomas yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

19:13 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

19:23 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

19:24 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

19:24 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

19:24 Melinda Michaels waves.

19:25 Constantine Stone waves.

19:25 Melinda Michaels asks, "How y'all doing?"

19:25 You say, "No complaints here."

19:26 Constantine Stone says, "Pretty good."

19:26 Melinda Michaels asks, "Y'all got all the info?"

19:26 You nod.

19:26 Constantine Stone nods.

Melinda has informed us that we will be stopping approximately two light years away from our destination and waiting until the majority of people are aware and active. This is estimated to be midnight, give or take a couple hours either way.
This is presumably a safety measure as well as so nobody jumps the gun. Unless a rift storm pushes us toward our destination much faster than we anticipate that means we will be waiting a signifigant portion of a day before we make first contact.
If you have any questions please forward those to Melinda Michaels.
Thank you and have a nice day

19:34 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

19:34 Melinda Michaels strides south.

19:38 Keegan Wantz nods.

19:39 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

19:39 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Everything going smoothly over there, Cartes peoples?"

19:39 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Sure."

19:40 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south followed by Wendy Arroyo.

19:40 You wave.

19:40 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

19:40 Nissi Valdaire waves.

19:40 Wendy Arroyo waves.

19:40 Wendy Arroyo sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

19:40 Nissi Valdaire says, "Boop."

19:40 Nissi Valdaire leans on Wendy Arroyo.

19:41 Ali Candan waves.

19:43 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

19:43 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

19:46 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

19:47 Keegan Wantz says, "Many boops."

19:47 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

19:48 Keegan Wantz says, "A Freyja."

19:49 Wendy Arroyo says, "What, where."

19:49 Keegan Wantz says, "In your brain."

19:49 Wendy Arroyo says, "It's pretty roomy in there, it might be."

19:50 Keegan Wantz asks, "Oh mighty Rift, are the lizards slowly taking over?"

19:50 Keegan Wantz begins using a sparkly ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on M.

19:51 Wendy Arroyo says, "Mmmmaybe."

19:51 Keegan Wantz nods.

19:51 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Well, ghost dudes, am I in danger of lizardification?"

19:51 Wendy Arroyo begins using a sparkly ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on 4.

19:51 Wendy Arroyo gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

19:53 Ali Candan says, "I am a lizard."

19:54 Ali Candan pulls out a small key and pushes it into a black backpack's lock.

19:54 Ali Candan opens a black backpack.

19:54 Ali Candan removes a sheet of scales from a black backpack.

19:54 Ali Candan asks, "See?"

19:54 Ali Candan grins at a sheet of scales.

19:54 Ali Candan puts a sheet of scales in a black backpack.

19:54 Ali Candan closes a black backpack.

19:54 Ali Candan turns a small key in the lock of a black backpack and then pockets the key.

19:55 Ali Candan says, "Hmmm."

19:55 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

19:55 Ali Candan strides south.

19:55 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

19:55 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

19:55 Keegan Wantz says, "A risk of four."

19:56 Wendy Arroyo says, "Out ooof."

19:56 Keegan Wantz begins using a sparkly ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on 2.

19:56 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

19:56 Keegan Wantz says, "Two."

19:56 Keegan Wantz says, "Four out of two."

19:56 Ali Candan says, "Took the jib down. Was slowing us down."

19:56 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

19:56 Ali Candan begins using a sparkly ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on J.

19:56 Keegan Wantz says, "Flow's almost perpendicular to us."

19:56 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

19:57 Nissi Valdaire says, "A good time for the mizzen."

19:57 Keegan Wantz says, "To the mizzenmast."

19:57 Keegan Wantz strides south.

19:57 Wendy looks down at her hands. "Wait a second, I'm already a lizard."

19:57 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

19:58 A Tardick lizard named Freyja curls its tail loosely around Wendy Arroyo's neck.

20:00 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

20:00 Keegan Wantz says, "I have mizzened, but the jib was poorly jibbing in a jibby manner."

20:00 Keegan Wantz says, "Might not have tried hard enough though."

20:00 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:00 Keegan Wantz strides south.

20:01 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

20:01 Keegan Wantz says, "Fiddling the jib amuses me."

20:01 Keegan Wantz sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

20:02 Keegan Wantz says, "I'm having trouble deciding if our lack of Outsider encounters is delightful or if I should be worried."

20:02 Ali Candan says, "I'd rather worry about it. If something happens, it doesn't fuck my happiness that way."

20:03 Wendy Arroyo snores.

20:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe they're having a party and we weren't invited."

20:09 A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:12 Keegan Wantz says, "Calling it now, we fly in and they're under siege."

20:12 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

20:13 Wendy Arroyo nuzzles Nissi Valdaire's neck softly.

20:13 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

20:14 Nissi Valdaire kisses Wendy Arroyo on her temple.

20:15 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

20:19 Wendy Arroyo leans toward Nissi Valdaire and softly licks her cheek.

20:19 Nissi Valdaire grins.

20:19 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

20:25 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

20:30 A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:31 I see no "lily" here.

20:34 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

20:37 Constantine Stone slumps where he sits and goes to sleep.

20:37 Constantine Stone suddenly awakens.

20:37 Constantine Stone says, "Good luck tonight everyone."

20:37 Constantine Stone waves.

20:37 Constantine Stone stands up.

20:37 Constantine Stone walks south.

20:40 Wendy Arroyo cuddles up to Nissi Valdaire.

20:41 Nissi Valdaire wraps her arms around Wendy Arroyo, pulling her close.

20:42 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

20:44 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

20:45 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

20:45 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

20:47 Keegan Wantz stretches.

20:47 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh, this scape."

20:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yay."

20:48 Keegan Wantz says, "At least it's not as sulphury as the volcano-demonscape."

20:48 Keegan Wantz says, "It just feels... dead, usually."

20:50 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the south followed by Melinda Michaels.

20:50 Morris Corlew disbands his group.

20:50 Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

20:51 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

20:51 Melinda Michaels stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

20:51 Melinda Michaels strides east.

20:51 Melinda Michaels strides in from the east.

20:51 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

20:51 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

20:52 A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:53 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

21:04 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

21:04 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

21:05 Melinda Michaels waves to Freyja, "sorry there but you can't have my coffee."

21:05 Morris Corlew grins.

21:05 Wendy Arroyo says, "Freyja would give you her coffee."

21:08 Melinda Michaels grins.

21:08 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

21:09 Morris Corlew stands up.

21:09 Morris Corlew shuffles east.

21:09 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

21:09 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a sparkly ouija board, a medium-sized crystal ball, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.
Ryan Thomas is sleeping on the floor.
Nissi Valdaire, Wendy Arroyo, Ali Candan, Keegan Wantz, and Melinda Michaels are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

21:09 I see no "lily" here.

21:10 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

21:11 Wendy Arroyo nuzzles Nissi Valdaire's neck softly.

21:13 Nissi Valdaire kisses Wendy Arroyo softly on the ear.

21:13 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

21:17 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

21:22 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

21:23 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:23 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Eve. You get your stuff?"

21:23 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ook ook EEEEEEEK! I did! Thank you."

21:24 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

21:24 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:24 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Heh. You're welcome."

21:25 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's important to keep your practice of the language up, you know. Who knows when we might meet a lonely monkey who has the answer to life and it's existence."

21:25 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:25 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hahaha."

21:25 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:25 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I mean...we're just evolved primates ourselves."

21:26 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

21:26 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh yeah, we are. All the more reason to keep up the practice of the language of the monkey."

21:29 Wendy Arroyo says, "Could check the course."

21:29 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I have just discovered that Johann attempted to kidnap one of my wonderful cans of delicious life. This has been resolved."

21:30 Ali Candan says, "Will be around halfway in 9 LTC's traveled."

21:30 Wendy Arroyo says, "Fine, fine."

21:31 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

21:31 Wendy Arroyo says, "Don't think we'll make it in time."

21:32 Wendy Arroyo glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

21:32 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:32 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "There's more. I think I put three in there? Plus hot chocolate that...ain't gonna be hot by now. I packed it up fore you went to bed and then just left it."

21:33 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

21:34 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh, I got it when it was still hot. I woke up some point after you delivered it, for a little while."

21:34 Wendy Arroyo gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Maybe if we're lucky and it keeps up."

21:35 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:35 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ah, good."

21:35 Morris Corlew says, "Well, we've got an hour and a half to make it more'n what it's taken us in 6. A really, really good storm might do it."

21:36 Wendy Arroyo glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

21:36 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Thanks for the hot chocolate! I did steal that."

21:36 Wendy Arroyo says, "Can get started between twenty-two and midnight is what I heard."

21:36 Morris Corlew nods.

21:37 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:37 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ain't stealin if it's meant for all y'all."

21:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "I predict all the course corrections from here on out will make us slower."

21:38 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire. "How it almost always works."

21:38 Wendy Arroyo says, "We'll be fine."

21:38 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh we know, and it was an appreciated change from the stuff we have here."

21:38 Wendy Arroyo says, "At worst, I'll just handle everything while you're all asleep."

21:39 Nissi Valdaire grins.

21:41 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:41 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "No problem. There's plenty more of most of it."

21:43 The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.

21:44 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not exactly what you wanna see when you're considering soup for breakfast. I...think I'm good on that."

21:44 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:44 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yep."

21:44 A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Almost course checking tiiiiiiiime."

21:47 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

21:47 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

21:47 Wendy Arroyo says, "I can't wait."

21:52 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

21:58 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

22:02 Wendy Arroyo says, "Well, I'll go do the thing."

22:02 Wendy Arroyo says, "Soon."

22:02 Nissi Valdaire nods.

22:02 Wendy Arroyo scrambles to her feet.

22:02 Wendy Arroyo strides south.

22:02 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a cup of hot chamomile tea.

22:03 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We'll be dropping out to check our course shortly."

22:03 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Copy that."

22:03 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

22:03 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

22:04 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:05 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Launch all the probes!"

22:05 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

22:06 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Do not probe our nuts. We wish them to remain un-probed."

22:06 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:06 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We don't wanna touch your shipnuts."

22:06 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh, you know you wanna."

22:06 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "But they're nice and salty!"

22:07 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:07 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not even if they're chocolate."

22:07 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Wait. If he knows they're salty, I don't wanna know what private times he's had with this ship and it's nuts."

22:07 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:07 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Or its tentacles."

22:08 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hahaha."

22:08 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "All nuts, the lot of you."

22:08 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Thanks!"

22:08 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Why thank you. I'm here all week."

22:10 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

22:10 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

22:10 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

22:10 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Seventy-eight point forty-two."

22:10 Ali Candan switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

22:11 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "So 8.2 ltc's."

22:11 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:11 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "10.1-ish."

22:11 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:11 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "10.13."

22:11 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh heh, yeah, that's right."

22:12 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Thanks. That twists my brain up more. We traveled this many ltc's, and we're this many lightyears away."

22:12 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:12 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:12 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:12 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:12 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Heh."

22:12 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

22:13 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I know right."

22:13 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:13 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ian's equipment gives him the info in light-years. Our ship displays are in cyclic."

22:14 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ali needs to keep his AI going all the time so he can convert on demand."

22:14 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh I figured, but math is hard when you're hardly awake."

22:14 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:14 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Math is hardly hard!"

22:15 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "It is for some of us."

22:15 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:15 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It is for-what he said."

22:15 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:15 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'm judging you all so hard. Or hardly judging. Which one do you choose?"

22:15 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "The latter."

22:15 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I don't care so I don't choose."

22:15 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I choose hitting your reset button, so hush."

22:16 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:16 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's a lever."

22:16 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, I'll let someone else pull on your lever."

22:17 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:17 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ain't touchin that one with a ten foot pole."

22:17 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Now now Eve, don't wind him up or anything."

22:17 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:17 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's a grand design. If it were a button, people would have pushed it already. My data is safer this way."

22:17 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Until you get a bit over excited when somebody pulls your lever."

22:18 Morris Corlew grins.

22:18 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:18 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Then I do a data dump."

22:18 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:18 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Copying all the data for a smaller AI."

22:18 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:18 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Into...hmm. I can't keep track of his bots' names."

22:19 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Okay. So where do you insert the lever? I mean, you've gotta dump it somewhere."

22:19 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:19 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You really wanna know? I don't think I do."

22:19 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Come on Morris, this is Eve we're talking about."

22:19 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not really, but he seems to have this all so well thought out, curiosity wins."

22:19 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:19 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "True that."

22:20 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

22:20 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

22:20 A readout shows Pre-Stellar Object 1582-3494 about 15.78 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.

22:20 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "That is a rare, rare thing."

22:31 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

22:32 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south followed by Wendy Arroyo.

22:32 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

22:32 Wendy Arroyo says, "It's me, fresh from single-handedly saving the expedition."

22:33 Wendy Arroyo sits down on Nissi Valdaire's lap.

22:33 Nissi Valdaire wraps her arms around Wendy Arroyo, pulling her close.

22:38 Wendy Arroyo kisses Nissi Valdaire slowly along her jaw.

22:41 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

22:41 Morris Corlew glances down at his mirror finish chrome wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

22:41 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:41 Morris Corlew finishes off a cup of hot chamomile tea.

22:41 Morris Corlew gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:42 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

22:42 Morris says to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, "Thank ya."

22:42 Morris Corlew pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

22:43 Nissi Valdaire kisses Wendy Arroyo on the shoulder.

22:43 Wendy Arroyo leans toward Nissi Valdaire and softly licks her lips.

22:43 Nissi Valdaire kisses Wendy Arroyo on the lips.

22:44 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:44 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I am detecting a very nearby ship."

22:47 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "So am I."

22:48 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well done Nissi. You made 2 people run to the control room right quick."

22:48 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Something to do."

22:50 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

22:52 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

22:54 Wendy Arroyo leans toward Nissi Valdaire and softly licks her eyelid.

23:01 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

23:02 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

23:04 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a cup of hot Colombian coffee with cream.

23:08 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

23:09 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

23:09 Melinda Michaels strides south.

23:10 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

23:10 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

23:11 You say, "Be abck in a bit."

23:12 You stand up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:12 You wave.

23:12 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.

You can go out.

23:12 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]

23:12 A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

23:12 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

23:12 You lie down on a narrow bunk.

23:12 You blink heavily and then doze off.

23:12 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

23:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

23:28 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

23:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:42 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

23:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:52 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

23:57 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

23:57 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repair time."

23:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

23:58 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:58 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am steadily ready."

23:58 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else?"

23:58 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're going out."
