Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Future Crimes"; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Meow the little calico
CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold
fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric
with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, a small purple
trash bin, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator
here.
You can go south and out.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
/$c'n7~UQi)sq[<tYOU?VI$?crwCwjD>L27&<O44
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser

fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. Its fur
is a normal short length on its legs and face, but elsewhere the fur is very
long, spreading across the ground when it lies down and giving it a thick fluffy
tail. The felo's short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked
white claws visible. A indigo, heart nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes
with vertical pupils. It has a small pair of golden butterfly wings.

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean

bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect
solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Endymion Spaceport; Repair & Rearm]
In spite of Endymion's classification as a frontier planet, this long warehouse
is kept surprisingly well-stocked with everything a starship pilot needs for
repairing and rearming his ship. Technicians in loose-fitting orange burnooses
occasionally shuffle in from a narrow doorway leading toward the back of the
warehouse to go into the pilot's lounge beside the counter or to peer out at
ships on the landing pad outside.
You can go northeast.

Two wind-blasted sandstone pillars, still retaining the heat of the previous
day, mark the entrance to the spaceport. Beyond the pillars is an uneven road
leading toward the dark silhouette of a ridge not far away to the north, the way
marked by a low concrete wall on the west side of the road. Lighting the
northern sky above the ridge is a brilliant curtain-like aurora of blue, green,

New Phoenix's heavy industry was especially hard hit by the bombardment of the
city. Several years ago, factories, research facilities, and industrial parks
populated the area north of here, but it is now closed to the public, and large
signs mounted to high concrete barriers stretching across the north end of the
street warn of various types of deadly hazards. Still, rebuilding is taking
place, evident in the construction of several large warehouses nearby. Among
them is a shiny new store, an elegant sign near the door reading, 'Blazing
Trails.'

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

Hello. I am going to take some people out to NQ for a couple of days. For those
of you who have never been, it is a lovely station about 3 or 4 hours away, with
lots and lots of maple. It is also a place to relax and have fun, for couples it
is a romantic get away, or from my experience it is just a lovely change of
scenery to go to decompress from stress. I liked bird watching in the tree
district area there. I will be leaving around 1400 hours on tuesday, and will
leave NQ at 1400 hours to return, on friday. If you would like to join us for a
little short vacation, be at Old Earth lounge before 1400 on the departure date.
If you have any questions, please respond to this post, send me a letter, or
call me. My number is in the directory. Also if you won't be awake around 1400
on Tuesday and you'd still like to go Let me know, so I can send you a key to my
ship I'll be taking so you can camp out there prior to ddeparture.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Shule and Lily,
welcome back. How was the rest of the artifact trip?"
tra 1 It went well. Made some good credits and we stopped over at Feng Wo too.
So glad I stuck around for that.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It went well. Made
some good credits and we stopped over at Feng Wo too. So glad I stuck around for
that."
tra 1 And thanks.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I would have
liked to see Feng wo again, but they were staying another week for artifacting
and that was really a bit long for my taste."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
tra 1 I understand. Much longer and I would have wanted to head back home too.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I understand. Much
longer and I would have wanted to head back home too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So is it true, did
Alko go missing?"
tra 1 It is. He apparently got left behind at Feng Wo.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It is. He
apparently got left behind at Feng Wo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How did that happen?"
tra 1 No idea. Evenia was so busy being upset at Lily and I because she thought
we had gotten a hotel room there and were planning to stay the night in the
hotel room that somehow notbody noticed Alko was missing.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No idea. Evenia was
so busy being upset at Lily and I because she thought we had gotten a hotel room
there and were planning to stay the night in the hotel room that somehow notbody
noticed Alko was missing."
tra 1 Er, nobody.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Er, nobody."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Maybe Alko got a
hotel room himself? So you were not allowed to get hotel rooms?"
tra 1 Lily and I didn't get a hotel room and were not planning on staying the
night. Lily just wanted to show me what the rooms were like.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Lily and I didn't
get a hotel room and were not planning on staying the night. Lily just wanted to
show me what the rooms were like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, was that your
first visit to Feng wo?"
tra 1 Johann had told everyone to stay close to the ship as we were not planning
on staying very long. Long enough to get charged up.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Johann had told
everyone to stay close to the ship as we were not planning on staying very long.
Long enough to get charged up."
tra 1 And yeah, it was.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And yeah, it was."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That makes no sense,
you go to feng wo to show it to people yet you don't stay longer than necesary
to charge the ship?"
tra 1 Yeah... Well, I would have loved to stay longer, but I was not the one in
charge.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah... Well, I
would have loved to stay longer, but I was not the one in charge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do not like
Johann's style of organizing very much anyway. I do hope he went with them to
find alko though."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/General.
tra 1 I think he did, but I don't remember for sure.
