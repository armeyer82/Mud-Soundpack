00:55:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

03:14:04 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

06:29:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Once they warm up and you deserve their love, you get it."

06:29:38 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "No."

06:29:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

06:29:55 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Mm."

06:34:29 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You're not going to train it overnight. Play with it two or three times a day, put down a treat for it when you're done. Over time it will get better."

11:42:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

11:42:21 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

12:47:36 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

17:01:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, so, I've been experimenting with the heavy fighter."

17:01:13 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

17:01:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I'm finding that it's really great for destroying other fighters, but the six guns really drain the grid quickly against corvettes."

Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

17:01:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Much like you said in your book."

17:01:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The rift is up."

17:02:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is it a viable strategy to use weaker lasers when you have 6 of them? Like I was thinking about the best 3s firing ones, for example."

17:02:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They do less damage, but use less power, and have an 8% hull hit bonus."

17:02:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll tell you what I told a lot of others before."

17:02:29 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Not much, would like to talk to you sometime, but now is not good."

17:02:57 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I will try to caught you sometime later."

17:03:06 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That works."

17:03:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The heavy fighters are nice, well-armed, well-armored ships. However, they have severe limitations which in a lot of cases just make them not viable for everyday use. The grid issue is definitely one, but so is the fact that they can't jump. That's why a lot of even the most advanced pilots honestly, still use the cadet fighters."

17:04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I like the flexibility of the cadet fighter's jump drive."

17:04:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Decent armaments, not horrific armor, and can FTL."

17:04:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also I feel like the two launchers on the heavy are overkill."

17:04:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They just use too much power."

17:04:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right now I have them loaded with the weakest guided torpedos, and that works okay."

17:06:40 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I started with an ETA of an hour 40. After an hour 13, it's down to an hour 25."

17:06:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "At this time, they're definitely overkill, since we don't have energy grids that can recharge that fast yet, or that can hold a great amount of power. Maybe in the long-term we might get something that will make them more worthwhile, but not at present. You think they're bad with torpedos, they're even worse with minicannons."

17:06:56 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "From the bubble?"

17:07:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."

17:07:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, what are those, 200 per shot?"

17:07:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't buy them yet but I think I might stick with torpedos for a while even once I can."

17:07:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Something like that."

17:08:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not that far away from being able to buy the jackrabbit grid."

17:08:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That should help a little, larger grid and faster recharge."

17:09:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Take it from me, it's still not going to help too much. Especially when you get the good 15 damage point crystaline lasers."

17:09:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, that's true, there are beefier lasers I still need to get."

17:09:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Even engineering tools at expert levels barely make the heavy fighter useable."

17:10:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, are there better energy dumps I can make?"

17:10:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe not me personally, but eventually."

17:11:59 [General Communication] Ted Warburton snores.

17:12:15 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Been bubbling?"

17:12:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, I went out there, but it was a slow day, so I decided to come back, and that's even slower."

17:14:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They require more points to use, but yes, there are."

17:14:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You get the blueprints for them from the glyphmakers."

17:15:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

17:15:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm almost able to head out there."

17:46:29 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

17:48:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "On a fighter, almost anything goes, honestly. Except like, storage increase, and max velocity increase. Obviously, none of the exploration plants, either."

17:49:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting."

17:49:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But the weapons ones are good depending on your loadout. Hull increase is good too, grid increase is fine."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

22:03:30 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

22:04:15 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
22:04:15 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
