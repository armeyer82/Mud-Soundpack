During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived
at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long
time since we drifted off course en route and it required about
another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When
melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want
to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back
in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to
prepare a written statement as well albeit I didn't ask permission
to do so but I really wasn't given the time to ask very many
questions.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda into the Control Room of the ship and the
exchange began like this. I asked? 'so Melinda do you have a
letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels says. "I do not, she is, um, unavailable."
Melinda then says, "So we are running without either voice
currently."
I nodd to Melinda.
I then asked Melinda? 'so who did she appoint to act on her
behalf?
"She did not appoint anybody," Melinda says. "I took it upon myself
to come out here and make sure you guys knew."
I then said to Melinda. 'well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here.
Melinda next said. "Since she is not available, I will probably
take it upon myself to send whatever letters are needed," Melinda
says. "Somebody has to."
I then went further to state. 'Second, I want to express that i am
very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime happens
to all citizens of all alliances.
'I am not happy with what has occurred.
Melinda then nodded in agreement.
I then said to Melinda. 'Still, I am not the Military. I am not
the aEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government
Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more.
I added with another question? 'So too, did Ather Jammoa send you
here?
"Nobody sent me," says Melinda.
I then said. 'ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who
wants me back there.
Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice," says Melinda, "troubling times are at hand and here I am."
Melinda says, "We want some kind of word, people are getting
upset."
I responded with. 'yes but if our government felt I should be
there, they have the means to dispatch that request to me. I
informed them before I left of my plans as well.
Melinda asked the following which I hoped would be a good faith
effort on her part to convey my need for clarification. "So," asks
Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?"
She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had to say
which was. 'Even if i were there, I am not the party who can
control the behavior of aEU citizens.
Melinda says, "Of course you can't."
She continued with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an
official capasity, you will remain on said trip," Melinda says. "Is
this correct?"
I concurred by saying. 'well it's very much out of my hands. They
need to understand that it's not within my power to control AEU
Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal with those
issues. You can certainly convey to them in o uncertain terms that
I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-
emphasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
Melinda says, "Okay I will do this."
Melinda says, "All right."
Melinda Michaels then stood up to leave without repeating anything
back to me as well as she didn't let me finish what I was saying.
I just went on by stating. 'If I were back there, there really
isn't anything I could do.
Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies."
She still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went
on to say. 'AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to
me as well.. "That's fine," says Melinda.
Melinda says, "I tried."
'Thank you for doing so.
Melinda waved. Then she says, o very unceremoniously, Melinda
says, "Yup."
Melinda says, "Later."
I waved back rather amazed that she seemed both not interested in
what I was trying to gather from the scant information I had as
well as nothing official from the leadership from the league nor
Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms.
Melinda Michaels then rather rudely walked out. There is certainly more that I would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a written statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request which didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took time to consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the AEU seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann in his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on to Tom Town to charge overnight. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. After a rather sleepless night, when I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very gracious and he
said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to
Comms. Since there was no other means aboard Johann's Galleon to
communicate that we were returning, it is unfortunate that a hasty
decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf. I further find
it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurr
01:52 y not to allow
me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared
before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on. I apologize
to you all though as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans of
others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.

Dear Lily and Shule,
I need some help. I am struggling how to handle my reaction to people's judgement and criticism and gossipping. It has stressed me out so much that I am considering retiring. I mean, these people used to be my friends, but now that I've closed up to them because of some tramatic event that happened to me, and because they gave me a blow and gave me reasons not to trust them anymore, they don't take it kindly. Instead I'm being judged and criticised for what I do, sugarcoated when I'm with them, and being very discouraged. It's not making my life as a pilot very enjoyable. It isn't fair, and I shouldn't feel the need to retire because of childish gossipping people who deprive you of what you want to do. To be frank I wish to know how you guy can stand to be around and stick through things, and these people? I mean to be honest from hanging around with my league mates you guys aren't very liked, but I just don't see why. Or maybe I do. Maybe it's because it's the same reason why I'm on their ganging up on side. Because I don't like to be controled by them or suck up to their faces.. I guess I'm just looking for some encouragement or comfort, and a reason to stay. I'm reaching out for help. I'm Katina, shy, hard to stand up for myself, and care too much what people think. I don't want to retire, I love being a pilot, I just wish people would leave me alone. I want to see the kind people around here, I don'
01:52 t often see them. Only the drama stirer upper people. Please help me? I'm asking to meet up with you guys and talk, or perhaps talk through exchanging letters if you don't have the time or want to meet up and talk about it. I've sent you both the same letter because I didn't know who to send the letter to.
sincerely,
Katina

You can go south and out.

01:58 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:58 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:13 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:30 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald". The organization has earned 1,236,324.92 credits.

02:38 Lily Kaise says, "Oops dead fishie just a moment."

02:38 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:38 Lily Kaise opens a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and gold aquatic life and coral rocks.

02:38 Lily Kaise removes a corpse of a large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior from a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and gold aquatic life and coral rocks.

02:38 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Thoughts on the current diplomatic situlation?"

02:40 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:40 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:40 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok guess we can head back to the Torus?"

02:40 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

02:41 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:41 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

02:41 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Mischief the old large black felo.
Mischief the old large black felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

02:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:41 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:41 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:41 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:41 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

02:41 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:41 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:41 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:41 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:41 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:41 The computer reports that the three-person light escort "Intense Focus" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:42 Lily Kaise presses some buttons on the sensor control board.

02:42 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as another starship is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

AS-0A AEU Light Escort Vessel "Intense Focus"

--

02:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:42 The computer reports that the three-person light escort "Intense Focus" has jumped out of the sector.

02:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:42 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

02:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:42 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:42 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I see vernos has an escort."

02:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:46 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

02:53 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

03:01 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

03:04 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:07 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Megapod?"

03:08 An oversized semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:09 You say, "He's had one for a while."

03:12 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:13 Mischief the old large black felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

03:15 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"
