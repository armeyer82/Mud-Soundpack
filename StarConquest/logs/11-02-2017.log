00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Weird, I turned in two sets of artifacts separately, so I could more clearly see the reward after 2000 points."

00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got 26 million for the first 22 artifacts and 14 million for the last 3."

00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "That's a lot."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I guess torn patches of unfamiliar woven fiber are worth a lot of credits."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, some artifacts are definitely worth more credits than others. I really don't know the exact values."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I always thought deactivated projectile weapons and spacesuits were the big bubble money makers, I guess because they seemed more rare."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess this is good to know."

00:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, as far as I know they do pay really good, if not the best."

00:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh cool, I can use the powered pistol now. I guess more become available the more you get."

00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah. It's good to check back every 50 points or so."

00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe even more frequently when you're starting out, I can't remember."

00:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's not terrible."

00:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think I want to bother collecting another 1000 before turning in the trip artifacts though."

00:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, probably not, but why ould you want to? The trip artifacts will pay much better. 3 points for each one I think."

00:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but I wanted to maximize my gains from the bubble before cashing any of those in."

00:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Reasoning that the trip artifacts would give me 3 no matter what."

00:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My hope is that after the trip I'll have enough to use decent probes, and can just go on expeditions for most of my exploration points."

00:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, yeah, you have a point there I guess."

00:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I definitely hope that will work out. I wish I could come on that trip."

00:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe you can. Hakeem has dropped out, so there's probably room."

00:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You could also tag along in my sightseer whenever I'm around, if you wanted to."

00:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, maybe, and Katina also dropped out, or so it seems."

01:04 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It'll be on the rundown or starmap."

01:05 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If it's the disabled rats probe mission from SVP, it'll show as other on the rundown or starmap, and there's an anomaly detector at SVP that they sell that'll notify you."

01:05 [Newbie Help] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Another handy command is the ships command in your control room. It tells you what other ships are in the sector besides you."

01:05 [Newbie Help] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah ok. Thanks."

01:05 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The rundown and starmap are interchangeable by the way, the starmap just gives graphical info and the rundown does not."

01:22 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "We still had problems."

01:22 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "The hosts sometimes will give suggestiosn I think."

01:23 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Best advice I can give you, is pay close attention to the feedback you get on both your concept and your profile. Don't change what they don't ask you to change. They give very good feed back."

01:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Either that or it's comm static."

01:31 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If someone is in an area with limited communications, that will happen."

01:31 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "No no its not that, trust me."

01:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Well, I haven't seen anybody saying anything at all on general recently."

01:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The other possibility is sometimes people get the audible socials mixed up with how it's done in other games."

01:32 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "It was nto on general but my alliance."

01:32 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably just someone on the fringes of the communicator range, or going through the skims."

01:33 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "But you mostly spoke plainly so yah."

01:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's somethin they can't help Evelyn. Part of game mechanics. Consider it to be static."

01:33 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "I am in the rift which is why I came across like that."

01:33 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Try and imagine those random things in their speech as static. Like if you're a long way from somewhere. So you can't properly understand the person."

01:34 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "There arn't really other ways to represent static in text."

01:34 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "If he gets even more out of range it starts dropping out words and such, at least it's done that to me before."

02:55 I can't find "sofa."

02:55 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:58 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

02:59 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

03:00 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

03:02 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

03:05 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do the goings on in the lounge imply that there are actually dozens or hundreds of civilian pilots?"

03:05 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "But just ten or so happen to turn their communicators on for whatever reason."

03:05 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. The pilot prograb is a lot larger than those on the comms."

03:05 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

03:05 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I've always thought of it as merchant pilots as well."

03:05 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Err...program."

03:06 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

03:06 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Somewhere in the help files it talks about there being a lot more pilots than what we see on the comm. Might be the common misconceptions one."

03:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:06 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Who, based on the pilot contract help file, seem to be a different thing entirely which would explain why we wouldn't have the same comm network and stuff."

03:06 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I know it said something like that, but I didn't know if it meant commercial and government pilots, or civilian pilots specifically."

03:06 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's more than just merchant pilots though. There are tons more civilian pilots than there are players."

03:07 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it makes more sense if there are more civilian pilots than just us in general."

03:07 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can also see examples of some in npc help files, implying that there are even more."

03:07 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's true."

03:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "So sorry!"

03:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I thought you might be in there and I should have looked in our living quarters."

03:12 You say, "It's ok. My fault. I should have grabbed it and moved it."

03:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I see constantine if we could get another eAOS or repair suit, we could pull it off."

03:14 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

03:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh well perhaps he's not listening to the aEU channel so guess it's a moot point. Still Love I feel badly as I know the feeling of separation anxiety1."

03:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh ok well I accidentally brought Shule with me when I came to New Earth and his Flare is still on Old Frontier so if we can find another EAOS or repair suit we could go cleanse it even though i'm pretty fried. I'd still do it for Shule as he needs his Flare."

03:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure, I can do that."

03:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh nobody wants that lame pay we get."

03:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't mnd it though."

03:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Mind it."

03:17 You say, "That or they don't want to help the AEU."

03:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah that's mostly it I'm sure."

04:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:10 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

04:10 [Starship "Bonzai Trout"; Control Room]

04:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.
(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

04:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Hamilton's Funnel. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Deep Wastes."

04:10 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:10 The computer reports that the one-person courier "Unreality Programming 711" has jumped into the sector.

04:10 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

04:10 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

04:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:10 The sensors tell you that this area is full of valuable salvage, but all you can see of it yourself is dark smudges that block the light of the stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:10 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon A-45."

04:10 The computer reports that the two-person bolt thrower "Meat Is Murder" has jumped out of the sector.
The computer reports that the reconnaissance craft "Let Me Call You Sweetheart" has jumped out of the sector.

04:11 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hamilton's Funnel clear. They jumped when we entered."

04:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh well can kill the interdicters."

04:11 [Tactical Communication] Daniel Blackwell transmits, "Okay, and they've just left."

06:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The carrier'll will have less charge total. Y'all are goin pretty far out there."

06:00 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's not bullshit at all. Some of us have a few older pets. There are too many people to justify bringing pets. Johann would if he thought it would be doable."

06:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Remember pets don't eat near as much as wild felo. Couple bowls and a pet can be fine for over a month."

06:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

06:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've kinda wondered if one of the things that tonic does is slow their metabolism way down."

06:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Need to eat less, less uh...crap I can't think of the term...cell agin or somethin?"

06:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I think it must, somehow. Or perhaps breeding makes them eat more."

06:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

06:06 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "He is. But I love the little guy."

06:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ya know what I ain't seen yet that I know of? Makes me wonder if they're even more rare than mean hummin felo...telepaths that are mean."

06:08 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I haven't either. Though...that makes me wonder about some of the felo on my mean ship. I have some that have that typical eyes and nose we've seen on those guys, but they're mean. I haven't spent enough time just kinda hanging around them though to see."

06:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've come up with a few maned in the line when I moved 'em round about too much and caused 'em to breed too fast...but never had a mean telepath that I know of."

06:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The vertical eyes with horizontal pupils?"

06:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. I think I've seen a couple that weren't like that though. And I know I've seen a couple new eye colors. Michael Kennedy has one of my line as a pet. A golden felo with silver eyes. He named it Sylivia but spelled it kinda odd, more like silver."

06:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "She's a real beauty."

06:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "She is. He still hasn't got her back from me. I've been waiting for him to ask."

06:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh man...umm...ok. I let him know to talk to ya."

06:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kennedy."

06:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I just sorta figured that he'd ask for her."

06:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Actually other than the one thing he said to me on the fringe channel after it happened, he hasn't mentioned her at all."

06:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I so much prefer seein the beginnin of the felo life cycle than the end."

06:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah. It's, much better."

07:25 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Someone remind me please. If you've got a bag of felo treats somewhere, what's the right syntax to get that prompt to get the bag, rather than a single treat?"

07:25 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sec."

07:26 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just get treats."

07:26 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Get treat and say no."

07:26 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sorry, say yes."

07:26 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hmmm. I wonder if it's a problem with where they are. If I use get treat or treats. It just gets the treat. Without the prompt."

07:27 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Possibly. Try get treats from container. That seems to just give me the treat, but if you aren't getting the prompt it's worth a try."

07:29 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks guys."

07:29 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You get it?"

07:30 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah. I might support. Because it doesn't matter what version I use. I can't seem to get them."

07:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've seen it happen before, and there was a solution. I just don't recall what it is."

07:30 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "When I was cleaning up all the cakes from Eli's party a couple of the cakes just refused to cooperate. I thought it had to do with their source, but maybe it was the table they were on."

07:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "What type of container is the bag in?"

07:30 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I've seen it before myself and fixed it, but I don't have a clue how."

07:31 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "On a nightstand."

07:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah! That might be it."

07:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "See if you can empty the nightstand into a bag?"

07:32 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nope, I can't do that either."

07:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where can I buy a garbage can?"

07:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Dammit. I remember finding a way around that at one point, I just can't think what it is."

07:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rattania has 'em, so does Pastica."

07:32 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm the same. It's driving me nuts."

07:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh nice, thanks."

07:34 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Though uh, I'm not quite sure how a trash can can be pretty. I'll get back to ya on that."

07:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs. "There's some in some of them ladies shops that are rather...pretty."

07:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lace and whatnot."

07:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Every time I see that asteroid one on old earth, I want it."

07:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. That's a pretty cool can."

07:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But tegan, she is best sanitation drone cool robot ever."

07:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."

07:38 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "You have to use a different noun, and I think you have to be sure and specify the table or whatever."

07:38 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Tegan is an adorable little circular robot that dings at you. Takes your garbage. And is just cool. She's nissi's."

07:38 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "It's something along those lines, at any rate."

07:39 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Lots of little dingdings and beepbeeps."

07:39 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh...try a multiple word match to the name maybe. Get felo treats. Something like that."

07:39 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm running out of nouns. And it's driving me batty because I've fixed this before."

07:39 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Try more than one word."

07:59 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well that shall remain unsolved for now. I ran out of treats."

07:59 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well that's one way to do it."

08:00 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well yeah. It solved the problem. In a way."

08:09 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.

08:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Man...why did I mention tegan before. now I want glorious hot chocolate."

08:14 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Yes, it's a little-known secret that Tegan takes all that stuff people give her and turns it into glorious hot chocolate."

08:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I should hope not."

08:14 [General Communication] "While that would be super amazingly fucking cool." Evenia Callseah laughs. "I just menat that usually where tegan is. So is the little hot chocolate robot."

09:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That. We do not have sadly. Um...Goss does. I wanna say Ali's org does. I think cats does."

09:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can however, offer you a glorious double torp plant. Or perhaps you would prefer a mini damage plant? Or if that isn't your style, there is always our sensor charge hybrid."

09:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Failing that, there is our torpedo resistance plant."

09:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah giggles.

09:04 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, the mini one and the sensor charge both sounds nice, though for different ships obviously."

09:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My next effort. Is going to be a mini damage. Torp resist hybrid."

09:06 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We murdered our life support plant. It was kinda pointless."

09:06 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. since plants produce oxygen, isn't a life support plant just a regular plant?"

09:07 [General Communication] "No you nutball." Evenia Callseah laughs. "It boosted life support on a ship. But um...It had a drawback that made it a touch pointless."

09:14 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Did you ever figure out what that one did?"

09:14 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The life support? It's downside?"

09:15 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I think you told me before that it was charge. I was wondering about the um.. pods I think they are?"

09:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh. Nope, not a clue. That fucking thing eludes all forms of discovery. If you have any ideas, I'll give you cuttings to test them. We're fresh out of ideas."

09:47 You hear Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.

09:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's metallic gold touch einrophone stops ringing.

10:03 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

10:19 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

10:27 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo suddenly jumps onto a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

13:25 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
This office is small but elegant, the recessed lighting shining softly over pale green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The door is closed.
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

14:30 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

14:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

14:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:30 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Quick Tamra, come and I'll help fix whatever he's done."

14:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: ?Z\GnoU\UV}Xb-#,2hj3XT'-&"R|=wO3o6b}e[ma
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

14:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:30 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:31 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

15:04 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:05 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

15:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

17:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I thought of using mistle and projectile, but then realized I had to give up my armor."

17:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I expect missile will mostly be useful when you're facing multiple opponents."

17:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'm not sure."

17:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I thought that was splash damage."

17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it is, but I'm assuming missiles do that."

18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mother nest mondays as soon as I get my tier 5."

18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, in the grand scheme of things, missiles are not dependable because they miss all the time.. but when they hit... Oh.. when they hit..."

18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I want to do a mother nest too."

18:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think they miss even more than gravitics."

18:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, taht's why you gotta have all the guidance to make them worthwhile, and even then if you miss the recovery time is long."

18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I got a lucky shot on a poacher leader once.. the lok on everyones face was priceless. Everyone was all ready to throw down and then it just got one-shotted with a missile."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm almost afraid to do a mother nest now. I hear they've gotten much more aggressive."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's why we'll do it every monday."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Until the broken limbs no longer phase us."

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know, I just got my second non-promotion the other day. They were very nice abou ttelling me that I did not get promoted again."

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I've had one non-promotion towards it so far."

18:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Once I get that one, I'm probably going to stop doing as many priorty deliveries and just focus on freight. You can already make a fair amount from shipping freight with the medium."

18:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's what I'm thinking I'll do too."

18:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably even get like a robot and a plant to make it bigger heh, since we'll probably be stuck with it for a long time."

18:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might try a couple different plants."

18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And see whether speed or size is better."

18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It will be like an experiment."

18:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I tried doing passenger runs for a while."

18:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you know if there's been any movement on the skim issue?"

18:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Has Ather been working on that behind the scenes?"

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No idea."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmmm?"

18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think he said he wants it to be you and I, contantine, when he goes. But I honestly thought it would have happened by now. That's one reason I didn't go with Katina and the others."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm very tempted to try and switch to a runabout for the trip."

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What are those all about? Are they faster than sightseers?"

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, with no boosts or anything, mine has a max speed of 28k. Which is faster than my sightseer which has a double speed plant."

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa!"

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if I can get one put together in time."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't have a ticket, though."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Eve usually keeps spares in case anyoen wants one, she might have one she'll sell you."

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, I would feel like a chump asking her, since she just sold me the detector for the sightseer."

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I read in this book of upgrades about being able to get certain ones at dry docks. Could either of you give me directions to these... dry docks."

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll just do this one in the sightseer."

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Just jump to Drydock. It's got it's own sector."

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can just autotravel there."

18:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Before you go increasing the size of your starship for the Artifacting trip, you probably need to contact Johann as the available Docking Bay space was already nearly maxed out."

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's also true, Lily."

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's a large station in league space. Kinda rundown but still very functional."

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And where might I buy closets, or a wardrobe."

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, definitely want to talk to Johann first. Though we've had two people drop out so I'm betting it's fine."

18:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I thought of it but I don't need any storage space anyways and I like having an onboard shower and living quarters."

18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ardsley has a furniture shop, Landfall might have that in its furniture shop."

18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The station in the Calm sells cheaper build it yourself type options."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's one of the debates i'm having with myself Lily. Do I want to sacrifice my living quarters and shower for that extra bit of speed."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Actually... yeah."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Plus, the work I'd have to do to get it ready to go in time."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Living quarters would be nice. I've done up my sightseer storage room as best I can, but it's still cold and gray."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I also like the sightseer battery."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably going to try to make a quick trip to Feng Wo while we're there. Just to get a look at the place and meet some of hte folks."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've discovered that I'm definitely a 24+ hour at a time kind of artifacter."

18:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I've slept in many a storage room."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hell yeah Constantine."

18:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's how we used to have to do it back in the day anyways, to make it worthwhile. No such thing as quick trip tot he bubble like there is today."

18:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I still feel weird when I hear people just randomly decided to go to GMG on a whim. I remember having to plan that shit out."

18:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, are the rest stations relatively new?"

18:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah well if we had 4 of us in my little Sightseer which was the original plan, an extra room would have been welcomed and uh huh the shower!"

18:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Still you can put a portable shower in the head which is what I always did before."

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah that's what I did in mine."

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I guess you could say they're relatively new."

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't imagine doing what I did at the bubble without the station out there."

18:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess it probably would have taken me months."

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "As it is I'm almost capped on exploration."

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Used to it was like this,  "Hey, you want to go to GMG? Oh, you do? Ok Let's meet up on Wednesday and head out so we can get started on thursday morning""

18:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Haha surprised you're not already but you sure will be when we get back!"

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never actually hit a cap on anything, but yeah, I think the artifacts from the trip are sure to get me there."

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When I was a cadet I used to get close on space combat all the time."

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for the bubble I just used to artifact as much as I could, then cut power to certain systems and just sleep in my ship floating in space. The stations are certainly much safer."

18:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I used to cap all the time but I am probably pretty far below capping anything now and thankfully as I had exploration caps for months!"

18:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli when Shule and were able to go to gMG, we used ot put a decent recharging station out there and we would regularly spend the weekend out there or a couple of days at a time."

18:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I keep thinking."

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One more haul, and Unreality is sure to recognize my loyalty."

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And devotion."

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But no."

18:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If we could get someone to cooperate with us, we could take a carrier over the skim via the Rift and make a little excursion out of it sometime."

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think shooting down other couriers gets you the most towards that."

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wait, what?"

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unreality wants me wrecking other courier ships?"

18:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Of course!"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:45 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

So, we are almost set! This is my first final checklist which will probably be updated as something vital I forgot gets brought to my attention.

First, be sure several of your friends, or in Ather's case, people who you can barely tolerate today will do fine, have keys to your artifacting ship. Also, as the owner of the carrier, Nissi should probably have access to everyone's artifacting ship keys just in case.

Second, Melinda offered, and I don't see why not, that if up to five people want to come home after a few days, she will take them home in the transport.

Third, for the trip down, the transport crew will be:
Johann, Melinda, Damien, Lily, shule, Ted, and Aisling.

Finally, if we leave, and you're not aboard, I don't plan on turning around, so make yourself accessible, or be left behind.

The final crew list is as follows:

Aisling The Fox: 6.5
Ather Jamoa: 6.5
sean Sloan: 6.5
Ali Kandan: 6.5
Tobias and Sarah: 6.5
Nicolette Lawrence: 6.5
Damien Alexander: 6.5
Ted Warburton: 6.5
Alko Delovega: 6.5
Bryan Stout: 6.5
Melinda Michaels: 5
Nissi Valdaire: 5
Johann Schraft: 5
Evenia Kallseah: 5
Eli Grey: 5
Lily, Shule,: 5
Constantine Stone: 5
Damien Goss: 5
Chase Marshal: NA
total so far: 105/117


Thanks,
Johann Schraft
