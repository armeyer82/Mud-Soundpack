02:44 [Deep Space]

02:44 The vacuum of space seems oddly peaceful now that it surrounds you. It is not deep black as you expected, but seems to be filled with a diffuse glow. Stars glint all around you, stunningly bright and sharp with no atmosphere or vacuum-protected glass to distort their light. A wide smear of stars fills one area of the sky, pointing the way Coreward.

02:45 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

02:45 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:45 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

02:45 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

02:45 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

02:45 I don't see that here.

02:45 I see no "ktty saving" here.

02:45 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

02:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

04:21 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

04:21 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

04:21 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

04:21 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.

04:28 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."

04:28 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:28 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:28 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:28 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

04:28 Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

04:28 There are no other ships in the sector.

04:29 You begin the docking sequence.

04:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

04:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:29 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

Four going home would overcrew the carrier by two. If Nissi does not have an issue with this, that's fine. If you came in on the transport and have items aboard, please grab them by 2200 tomorrow. If you are wanting to go home, let us know by that time also. Otherwise, happy artifacting, stay safe and all that good stuff.

[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging Eatery & Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.

Star Conquest Help: Metachannel Communicators
--
Category: Communication
--
Each character starts the game possessing a metachannel FTL communicator. This allows people to transmit on the set of channels viewable only by their alliance as well as the Tactical and General channels, open to all alliances. Also, the Newbie channel is available through this device.

To use them, the following commands are used.  (Please note that you must be wearing the communicator and it must be on.  It must also be YOUR communicator.  Do not give your communicator to another player, or swap it.  This will stop the communicators working, as they are assigned to the person in question both ICly and OOCly.)

To turn the communicator on and off completely, the command TURN COMM is used.
To turn the Newbie channel on or off, NEWB COMM is used.
To turn the General channel on and off, GEN COMM is used.
To turn the Tactical channel on and off, TAC COMM is used.

To transmit on the Newbie channel, use the command TRANSMIT NEWBIE message (this can be shortened to TRA NEWB message)
Example: TRA NEWB How do I communicate with people?
Result: [Newbie Help] Cameron Jellas transmits, "How do I communicate with people?"

To transmit on the General channel, use the command TRANSMIT GENERAL message  (this can be shortened to TRA GEN message)
Example: TRA GEN Hello.
Result: [General Communication] Darla Kinnington transmits, "Hello."

To transmit on the Tactical channel, use the command TRANSMIT TACTICAL message (this can be shortened to TRA TAC message)
Example: TRA TAC There are Battle Thralls in sector 26!
Result: [Tactical Communication] Ella Lerini transmits, "There are Battle Thralls in sector 26!"

The channels specific to your alliance are slightly different.

You can TUNE COMM TO NUMBER, where NUMBER is a channel number from 1 to 10, to transmit on that channel using the command TRA message.

Example: TUNE COMM TO 1
Result: You tune a metachannel communicator to ALLIANCE | Channel 1.
Example: TRA Hello.
Result: [ALLIANCE | Channel 1] Faye Masters transmits, "Hello."

You can also TUNE COMM TO 0 (the number zero) which puts the communicator in tuner mode, allowing you to hear transmissions on all of your alliance channels.  However, this means that the command to transmit to those channels is slightly different.  Since the comm is no longer tuned to a specific channel, you must specify the particular channel number you wish to transmit to.

Example: TUNE COMM TO 0
Result: You tune a metachannel communicator to the ALLIANCE tuner.
Example: TRA 1 Hello.
Result: [ALLIANCE | Channel 1] Georgina Norrington transmits, "Hello."

You can also use social commands with your communicator by simply transmitting the command, or emotes by transmitting a normal emote command.

Example: TRA GEN laugh
Result: [General Communication] Darla Kinning
05:13 ton laughs.
Example: TRA GEN :snorts and then laughs.
Result: [General Communication] Darla Kinnington snorts and then laughs.

Note that your character is physically speaking into the communicator -- anyone in the room with you will hear any transmission made by you.

If you wish to have a private conversation with someone, your character will need a device called an einrophone.

05:55 You nod.

05:55 Lily Kaise says, "So I built a new one before we left and it's in my Constructor."

05:55 You say, "Ok."

05:55 You say, "Yeah, I think you told me before we lft."

05:55 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't know if Kim was able to come out here so I asked her to deploy it but obviously she was able to join us."

05:56 Lily Kaise says, "So."

05:56 You nod.

05:56 Lily Kaise says, "I left a note for Melinda. I think she was one whose key I didn't delete when I got rid of other's access."

05:56 You say, "Well, hopefully she'll do it."

05:57 Lily Kaise asks, "Still, if she doesn't have a key, if she calls either one of us back to give her a key, would you be ok to jump back to give her one if I don't hear her?"

05:57 You say, "Sure."

05:57 Lily Kaise says, "Great and I can just get you another key when we get back."

05:57 You nod.

05:57 You smile.

05:57 Lily Kaise says, "Let me see though."

05:58 Lily Kaise slides a "Herding Cats" key off of an enameled purple space cat keyring.

05:58 You grin.

05:58 Lily Kaise slides a "Herding Cats" key off of an enameled purple space cat keyring.

05:58 I see no "keyring" here.

05:58 Lily Kaise says, "Ok there you have an extra one and so do I."

05:58 You slide a "Herding Cats" key onto a keychain.

05:58 You grin.

05:58 You say, "Perfect."

05:58 Lily Kaise slides a "Herding Cats" key onto an enameled purple space cat keyring.

05:58 Lily Kaise slides a "Herding Cats" key onto an enameled purple space cat keyring.

05:59 Lily Kaise says, "I also told her that Constantine and Kim have keys as well so hopefully if she's ok to deploy the station, there are plenty of keys."

05:59 Lily Kaise grins.

05:59 You nod.

05:59 You grin.

06:00 Lily Kaise says, "If it doesn't happen, we'll be ok. I jsut like to keep that scoop going because that has been our only means to earn Megacredits and so on for perhaps a couple of months now."

06:00 You nod.

06:01 Lily Kaise says, "We're earning reasonable Command. Not quite to the extent that we did prior to all of the bad-mouthing and shunning but we've done ok."

06:01 You nod.

06:01 Lily Kaise shrugs.

06:01 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

06:01 Lily Kaise says, "We'll also be ok once we get to 2000 Command too as we can jsut exchange credits for Megacredits but we don't have that luxury at this time."

06:02 You say, "Yeah, that'll be nice."

06:02 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway, we'll see how it goes. I also told her that she is free to use my constructor for any building she needs to do."

06:02 You say, "Ok."

06:02 You smile.

06:03 Lily Kaise says, "I sort of think they might put up the beacon chain again so it might come in handy for that."

06:03 Lily Kaise says, "I will get one for sEAS too. We just haven't needed one."

06:03 Lily Kaise suddenly bashes her spacesuit helmet into your face.

06:03 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

06:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:03 You laugh.

06:03 Lily Kaise removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

06:03 You laugh.

06:04 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Sorry Love!"

06:04 You say, "It's ok."

06:04 I don't understand that.

06:04 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:04 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

06:04 You say, "Much better."

06:04 Lily Kaise chuckles.

06:11 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]

06:11 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging Eatery & Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a small dusky pink trash bin, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.

14:24 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

15:40 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

15:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.

19:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

20:35 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Once I loaded my arial fortress on my mule, is it impossible to remove it."

20:35 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Like if I want all the docking bay space."

20:35 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh, it's empty even with a mule in it I guess."

20:35 [Newbie Help] Bryan Stout transmits, "This would probably be something best asked in character,."

20:36 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Could be."

20:36 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's an ok question for here too. There may not be anyone around he can ask."

20:36 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "To my knowledge the fortress does not take away from the rest of the docking bay, as it is something that only fits in a mule."

20:37 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Excellent. Thanks. And I just tried and didn't get any responses in character so, I learned this from some tech when I bought it apparently."

21:07 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Aerial fortresses do not actually go inside the mule at all. They clamp to the underside, as implied in the text when it detaches and reattaches. Though it is easy to miss and never really made explicit anywhere! But now you know!"

21:08 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ha. You learn something new every day. It makes sense, but I hadn't thought of it."

21:08 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How do they avoid being shot during ship to ship combat?"

21:08 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm actually curious about that in general, cause I've always understood that docking with temp stations worked the same way."

21:08 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Through your very clever evasive flying. Well done, Erik!"

21:09 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Haha."

21:09 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah chuckles.

21:09 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Ships do actually go inside temp stations."

21:09 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hence the docking bay."

21:09 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Though in the original version of them from years ago, you could also attach docking modules to dock externally. But it was never used because there was no real reason to ever do that."

21:10 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am learning more interesting things. I like this."

21:10 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ah, okay. I remember asking when I was new to the game and being told they just connect to airlock modules on the side. I think my particular question was how it was that a station module transport could carry all those modules and still fit inside a station. I guess the size changes a lot once you fill the thing with atmosphere."

21:11 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now I'm curious who told you that. Heh."

21:12 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "You know, I was pondering the whole mod transport the other day, when we build 3 stations from one transport, and now each of them holds many ships, including that mod transport."

21:12 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Temp stations are made from expanding memory metal and also partially just inflatable. Like rescue pods! I suppose that's another thing not made explicit anywhere."

21:12 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I always wondered that about rescue pods too. Specifically because of capsules. Where the heck would you put a rescue pod in a capsule?!"

21:13 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The rescue pods being inflatable is in a help file...somewhere."

21:13 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh, in the aptly named rescue pods help file."

21:13 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is it? I don't recall seeing that, but I don't have them memorized...thank goodness."

21:14 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My image of stations suddenly swelling up like massive hot air balloons from that has made my morning. Thanks, glorious mind of the squid."

21:14 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew laughs. "Yeah, same."

21:14 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "I suppose it does say that it pops out."

21:15 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's hinted at in how the station has to float a bit away from the ship before it comes online."

21:15 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Memory metal is a real life thing, if you're not familiar! Metal that has one shape, then transitions to a different shape when a current is applied."

21:15 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now see I always thought that was just because the station obviously can't occupy the same coordinates as the ship."

21:16 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, they make eyeglass frames out of the stuff."

21:16 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Inflatable spaceships aren't that outlandish either. The lunar lander had walls as thin as tin foil."

21:16 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, they are trying to make more and more that way."

21:16 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Very cool."

21:17 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I personally am familiar with it, but hot air balloon stations in my head have now stuck."

21:17 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I recall hearing that somewhere. So much SC tech is not so far on the horizon or things I would so love to have."

21:25 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "I've added a line to the temp station completion message to make their nature more clear."

21:25 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh cool. Thank you again!"

21:25 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Awesome, thanks, that definitely adds to the flavour."

21:26 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Very cool, thanks!"

21:26 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Cool, thanks. Now I can't wait to see what it is. I like little changes like that."

21:26 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "So do I."

21:27 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And I particularly appreciate that you don't tell us about each and every tiny change, only the ones that actually matter."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "I've also found myself adding an unreasonably epic message for an asteroid processor docking bay when an asteroid is delivered, because we were lacking one completely."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew laughs.

21:33 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah laughs.

21:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "This I can't wait to see."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Me neither."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Same."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Is it add random message day? If so, please continue to surprise us."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hey, if you're adding messages, any chance we could get a message for when you get transfered to the asteroid hauling station cause the asteroid you were standing on got hauled?"

21:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Reminds me of all the requests to make it so that wouldn't happen."

21:35 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Heh, I could see a rather comical one for that."

21:35 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not only am I sure you'll come up with a fun one, but also I'm sure newbie's have been really confused about what exactly just happened."

21:35 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And one for when you land in the mining station from inside your virtual reality suit and you ended your mine maybe?"

21:35 [MTTS] lunadrell has joined the channel.

21:36 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Doesn't that already have you take off your suit and be in the room like normal?"

21:36 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That's what I thought too."

21:36 [MTTS] lunadrell: I like your sense of humor in the swashbuckler's cafe.

21:37 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "If it does, I don't see it, that needs sorting then, which I will do."

21:37 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean, obviously you know what just happened. You ended your mine and took your suit off."

22:02 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah chortles. "Okay, now this I gotta see."

22:02 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "As long as there isn't now a random chance of actually being eaten by the processor."

22:06 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

22:06 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.

22:13 You turn off the silent running feature.

22:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:13 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I don't think mail delivery gives points."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There are activities that are very low point gain and high credit gain, yes."

22:13 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.

22:13 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

22:13 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

22:13 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

22:13 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It does Erik."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And I'm sure that trading doesn't."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "It does."

22:13 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

22:13 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

22:13 You may not leave the starship while it is moving.

22:13 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Trading does."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I mean mail delivery does give points."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh, ignore me then."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Trading does, even."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Wow okay. I apparently know nothing."

22:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:14 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's how my char made some of his earliest points. Trading does make a tiny amount, mining makes a tiny amount. But you do want both points and credits."

22:14 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

22:14 [Enter `yes' or `no']

22:14 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You will want both for your char, Dorothy. There isn't a lot to spend credits on without points."

22:15 [Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "Not me with my idea I would not need points, I want to play just with rp and not bother with profile."

22:15 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

22:15 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

22:15 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

22:15 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

22:15 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

22:15 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

22:15 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

22:15 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

22:15 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The point of the profile isn't to let you make points."

22:15 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "We don't do that here. You will have to have a profile, even if your char were a non-pilot."

22:15 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

22:15 You turn on the silent running feature.

22:15 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The point of the profile is to help you with your roleplaying."

22:16 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean, if you want to stay a cadet forever, that's fine. But you will never have access to many things. You can be a cadet forever if you want, but you will still want some points."

22:16 [Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "But profiles are too hard."

22:16 [Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "And if we're being honest with ourselves, people will respect/treat you better after you get past cadet, as it shows you know what you're talking about."

22:17 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "The profile is all about roleplaying, even though it allows you to earn more points after you have it approved. For further information you could of course always speak with the staff using a support ticket, because they can give you more information on what you wish to do than we can."

22:17 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also, if you consider a Profile to be too hard, then how do you consider that you will be able to rP a well-developed character?"

22:17 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Profiles are something that will allow you to roleplay more, in a much more dynamic way. Yes, they can be difficult, but you have a mentor and staff who can assist you. Pay close attention to what staff tell you in their responses."

22:18 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "The hard part, if you ask me, is actually the character concept, I'm not sure how I would have got through that bit to be quite honest."

22:19 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wish we'd had that when I was new. It would have saved me a good bit of frustration with my first profile being rejected."

22:19 [Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Its a blessing and a curse in that once you get that approved first time, the 6 attempts at a profile are... a test of pacients, to be sure."

22:19 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "I wish profiles were easier I need a fresh new one."

22:20 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "The profile is very helpful as a way of giving you many props on which to base your RP, and act consistently."

22:21 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "No its not helpful for me, roleplay for me is just imagining and exploring."

22:21 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Imagine and explore your character, and put that into a profile."

22:21 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "I do beautiful writing but not the way its wanted here.\."

22:22 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "I would always explain the profile as a writing of who my character is."

22:22 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "So adapt your beautiful writing to what they're asking for."

22:22 The ship's current engine speed is 25000 km/s.

22:22 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 10.1 seconds.

22:22 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "You won't be able to do certain things that qualify as exploring without having to have others bring you along."

22:22 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Imagine what you wish! The purpose of the profile is just to make sure you have a clear concept and that it fits into the game world. Many people drastically overcomplicate it, particularly with the biography section."

22:23 [Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "The best bit of advice. Play the game first, Play the game first. My first profile did not fit the game, at all, because I just didn't know what I wanted katie to be. And listen to squidmind. As that's probably me he/she is talking about, hehehe."

22:24 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "And, they have made it possible to play for much longer before you have to worry, which is a very good thing."

22:24 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's a lot of us, Katie. My first profile was nothing but biography."

22:24 [Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "The way it seems to me the hosts make it complicate it because I have done profiles where nothing seemed right and I did not understand how to change to what they want, I know I am not good with words."

22:25 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "All I can offer here is that I do understand your frustrations. The best thing I can say is that it's truly worth the difficulties you might face with the profile in the end. SC is honestly the best space mud I've ever played. Try and work passed the issues you're having. I promise the game world is worth it."

22:25 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's ok. Just take your time, read and reread what they have to say to you, and unless the entire things needs changed, only change specifically what they point out."

22:25 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

22:25 [Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "That is just it, I love love the game and want to play."

22:25 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Put what you're typing in a word processor and save it, then when you have to try again, you'll be able to open the document and modify it as directed and paste it all back into your next profile attempt."

22:25 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I don't remember who said this, but it might help, when they tell you to change something, change that thing, instead of completely throwing away the entire profile and starting from scratch."

22:25 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "When you think that some people have played for 7 years and more, straight, hopefully it helps you realise there is no rush, if you have everything within a couple of years, what then?"

22:26 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you love it as much as you say, take the time. Be patient. It will come. Staff is very good about working with us to get it to something that works."

22:26 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

22:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

22:26 [Newbie Help] Bryan Stout transmits, "Yes what everyone has said here. It doesn't have to be super complicated. You can always talk to staff later to see how your character is doing in their eyes, see if your style of play could change in any way to reflect your profile, etc. Patience is key. It's also very rewarding in the end."

22:26 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Believe me, we really don't want it to be complicated. Profiles are an incredibly huge timesink, which is a big reason we added in one sentence concepts for approval first. If your profile is approaching 500 words, you probably need to refocus. Personality is all we really care about, how we can espect your character to react to the various forms of drama and plot that are common in this game."

22:28 You turn on the silent running feature.

22:28 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "It's not disallowed! The only problem would be that not everyone uses OOC knowledge responsibily, but that wouldn't be on you."

22:28 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Or responsibly either."

22:29 [Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "I know so far I've seen the staff are quite against taking profiles IC, but if I may ask, would it be plausable, to perhaps have them as paperwork, as that's what I've seen[not mentioning names!], and that way the players, perhaps voice of the cores, can offer player assistance to the other players, so that its not as much as a timesink for the staff?"

22:30 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "There's the mentor system for that too."

22:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "How would it make sense to talk about your character's background that hasn't been approved yet in an in-character way?"

22:30 [Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "Okay Squidmind, I will ask you is there a way I could do what I mentioned earlier?"

22:30 [Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "The help files explicitly state not to refer to them as paperwork or IC at all."

22:30 [Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Ah, I was not aware of the mentor thing. I never saw my mentor!"

22:30 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "They can't really be made IC. Done properly, they'll often contain details or a certain level of self-awareness known to the player but not the character."

22:31 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "I am certainly not against people helping others with them, though. As long as you're not writing it for them!"

22:31 [Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Nodnod. I get that, It was just an idea I had off the top of my head to lighten the staffs load, as it were. I was going to see if Mr, squid liked it, in which case I'd write it up propperly, and submit it to the staff on support."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Bryan Stout transmits, "Off."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Someone did ask me how they could send me their profile so as their mentor I could look at it, and I would not know how to do that."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Dropbox is a wonderful tool."

22:32 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Getting together and exchanging papers would be the only way, really."

22:32 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

22:32 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Or using pastebin or something, I suppose."

22:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have had proteges send me their concepts, since they're short and I was able to point a few things out. But profiles are a bit long to send to a mentor through the mentor channel. I have sat with someone on a ship in private for a discussion that was ooc in nature to help them clear up misconceptions and things, however."

22:33 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Most times I've managed to help as a mentor by asking the right questions."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can just paste it in dropbox and generate a link, that's still anonymous."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Dropbox links are an idea, never considered that."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Dorothy Miller transmits, "That is what I need, someone to ask me the questions and I answer,  etc."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "When you type profile and you let it do the wizard, the profiler asks the questions for you, those were good enough to help me anyway."

22:40 [MTTS] alc_71: While I wouldn't mind answering questions say on the mentor channel, it's a thin line to walk because there are people who expect you just to keep going till you've essentially written their entire profile.

22:42 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.

22:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:42 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

22:42 [MTTS] davetaylor: Agreed, I'm always very clear if somebody is doing that that it has to be their work, the number of times I have to bat things back at them and say it depends what type of char you want to play.

22:42 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

22:42 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

22:42 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

22:42 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

22:42 [MTTS] usfolks: Absolutely. I had that happen once. Offered to look at one and give suggestions, this is the person I wrote the list of questions for...and they kept asking me to just rewrite it. Obviously I said no. But it's definitely a slippery slope. I can see people thinking it's just easier to do it for someone else...but then it actually takes something away from them. I know someone who didn't write their own profile. And I fear they suffered for it.

22:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:42 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

(14 seconds roundtime.)

22:43 [MTTS] usfolks: Unfortunatley it's been done before.

22:43 [MTTS] alc_71: Maybe it could be possible to hold a Q&A profile session once in awhile on this or another channel so that things could be monitored properly.

22:43 [MTTS] rosey: I want to have a char who likes to entertain with music and stuff besides the other normal pilot activities but don't know how to write it so the feedback giver can't say it looks like what I want to instead of what my char wants.

22:44 [MTTS] usfolks: I like that idea, alc_71.

22:44 [MTTS] Squidmind: That's a good point to make; if you have someone else write a profile for you, you're missing the point in why we have the profile system to begin with.  As for helping someone refine theirs, asking them questions is the best way to do that.  Giving any kind of solid answer about anything TO the person tends to get misunderstood.

22:44 [MTTS] usfolks: Sounds fine how you wrote it. And as was said to me once, remember that hobbies do not make the personality. Your char is more than their love of music.

22:45 [MTTS] rosey: I know that.

22:45 [MTTS] Squidmind: We've considered doing a forum about profiles before, but the big problem with that is that the people who would attend... would already predominantly have approved profiles.

22:45 [MTTS] usfolks: Absolutely, Squid. Unfortunately some people don't want to do the work themselves. And Squid, I wonder if we did one every month or so, would that get the people who really need it...and also give the rest of us some pointers in helping those who can't.

22:46 I don't understand that.

22:46 I don't understand that.

22:46 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

22:46 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

22:46 I don't understand that.

22:46 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

22:46 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space. The hatch appears to be locked. A small, gently pulsing red light near the hatch marks that the airlock currently possesses a hostile environment.
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.

22:46 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

22:46 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

22:46 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

22:46 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

22:46 [MTTS] rosey: But that is something I had trouble with before was feedback saying mine is just what I want and not my char so I get confused on how to write or to word it.

22:46 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

22:46 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

22:46 [MTTS] usfolks: You are not your char. That's not what roleplaying is. I told someone that recently, too.

22:46 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

22:46 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

22:47 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

22:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:47 You turn on the silent running feature.

22:47 [MTTS] davetaylor: Liking playing music doesn't tell us how you might react in RP situations, for instance, when you hate somebody and it's very obvious.

22:47 [MTTS] rosey: My feedback seems to confuse me even more because it often seemed I did nothing right.

22:47 [MTTS] Carroll: I am good at creative writing but not the way its asked for here.

22:47 [MTTS] usfolks: So if you like music, making music, and entertaining people, while you can roleplay that, it shouldn't be because it's what you want.

22:47 [MTTS] Butchulla: Something like that is definitely something I'd attend. I'm all for trying to help people.

22:48 [MTTS] Carroll: Sorry what do you mean its not supposed to be the way you want?

22:48 [MTTS] rosey: That is a good example of a confusing comment, who would not do something because they want.

22:48 [MTTS] nadira: Yes, a forum about profiles and character concepts sounds like a good idea, and that I would like to attend.

22:48 [MTTS] rosey: I do it in real life.

22:48 [MTTS] Carroll: That is stifling a person's spirit and creativity.

22:48 [MTTS] usfolks: My char has some likes and dislikes, personality traits, very much opposite to who I ame. Because if I come here and I play myself, even at a different age, gender, race, and period in time, that is not roleplaying.

22:49 [MTTS] Squidmind: Sometimes it's as simple as just explaining why the character does something.  'My character plays music for people' doesn't tell us anything about the character, just an action they take.  If you explain what motivates them to take that action, it has a better chance of showing the thought process of the character.  And I don't mean 'i want to entertain them', because that's not the full picture either.

22:49 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

22:50 [MTTS] usfolks: Because of that, my char gets on my nerves at times. I can't stand the person they are...because they are not me and I wouldn't be friends with them. But that makes it better RP. Don't play who you are, play the character you want to play, yes. But don't make them like to do something because you like to do it. Then you're just being you in a space game and not roleplaying at all.

22:50 [MTTS] alc_71: The best advice I can give you is learn separation. I was terrible with it for awhile and have worked hard to become better. Separating yourself from the character is key. The character concept will give you more time to sort out the profile. I do wish that were available when I was trying to write mine.

22:51 [MTTS] Squidmind: Carroll: I think what usfolks is trying to say there is that there needs to be a disconnect between the player and the character.  If the character is doing something just because that's what the player would do in that situation, that's not roleplaying, that's the player being the player.  It leads to the removal of the IC/OOC divide and creates OOC issues.

22:51 [MTTS] usfolks: Yes Squid, thanks. I'm doing too many things at once and not explaining myself too well I guess.

22:52 [MTTS] Carroll: If that is the way I want to play, that is my choice, in fact its good to play yourself in another world it stretches your thinking and imagination.

22:52 [MTTS] rosey: But how can staff know if I am doing that or not, they do not know me oocly.

22:52 [MTTS] Squidmind: Except it doesn't, at all.  If you're being you, then you're not roleplaying.  You're responding to events as you, the player, would.  Which WILL lead to OOC problems, because we see it on a regular basis.

22:52 [MTTS] rosey: For all they know, in real life I hate music.

22:53 [MTTS] Carroll: To me roleplay is like entering into a book and feeling chars doing their actions even if you have a hint of yourself.

22:53 [MTTS] alc_71: For example, let's say you have had four characters. They all behave very similarly, staff is going to figure out that you are playing yourself easy enough.

22:53 [MTTS] rosey: The type of character I am trying to make is different from any others I have had.

22:53 [MTTS] usfolks: A lot of times they can tell. And yes, they see how we react. I reacted oocly to a decision my chari made mecause I have the same flaw as they do. Somehow I managed not to avoid. There's no way we can be opposite our char, but we can make enough things different and do our actions on behalf of them, and not on behalf of ourselves. When you start doing that, you tend to get hurt, frustrated, and worse.

22:54 [MTTS] Squidmind: Rosey: That's fine.  But liking or disliking music doesn't actually have anything to do with the character concept or their personality.

22:54 [MTTS] Carroll: And the tropes are so stifling to me!

22:54 [MTTS] nadira: Well, lots of people, including myself, who have played on this game for a longer time, can tell you exactly why being yourself only hurts you in the end. What if the story your character ends up in is too confronting to you, comes too close to reality? I have spent months feeling really bad because things related to a previous character were too close to who I am, and it had made me, the player, feel depressed. No one needs that.

22:56 [MTTS] usfolks: Tropes are there fore a reason. They're overused. If you can find a way to use one in a creative way and explain yourself, you might get lucky.

22:56 [MTTS] usfolks: Also apparently my typing skills are sucking today. Apologies.

22:56 [MTTS] rosey: This is why I think it would be fun to just play to roleplay and not worry about points so I don't have to do the hard job of a profile.

22:56 [MTTS] rosey: But I would need credits to do that too.

22:57 [MTTS] alc_71: I try to find things for my character to like that I dislike or vice versa. Like I will never create a character who is into aspects my real line of work. Also, smaller things like you may love beer and your character be strongly against drinking alcohol. It does help with the separation.

22:57 [MTTS] Squidmind: The profile is there to help you roleplay, it's not a method to avoid it.  That's why you can play the game to get a feel for the game world and setting before you have to submit one.  Unless there are OOC issues, of course.

22:58 [MTTS] rosey: But it seems I can try my best and still fail.

23:00 [MTTS] nadira: When I first discovered this game, on march 29th 2012, and I read I was gonna have to write a profile in order to play my character, I nearly just gave up. Seemed far too difficult to me. Then the game drew me in, and so I wrote a profile. Now a game that seriously calls itself a roleplay game that doesn't have any profiles at all just makes no sense to me.

23:01 [MTTS] Butchulla: This conversation makes me think about something. I've noticed many players coming up while I've had this character that seem to have issues with profiles. Not just on an understanding it based situation, but also because there are language issues. I wonder if maybe there were a way for any of us who might speak their language to assist them, that perhaps they would be able to achieve a profile, rather than the frustration that we seem to see, and then they give up.

23:02 [MTTS] Carroll: There are far to many good people out there that truly want to play but the whole profile system is to much and is many tiems to nick picky and not not letting the person truly let themselves go.

23:02 [MTTS] Carroll: Oosp times.

23:02 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:03 [MTTS] Squidmind: The biggest reason for not playing yourself is always the fact that if you're playing a character that isn't you, there's a distance between the actions taken and you.  So when other characters and the game world react negatively to your actions, you don't feel OOCly terrible.  But if you're just you, you're going to feel pretty bad in real life because they're not saying 'that character did something dumb', they're saying 'YOU did something dumb'.

23:06 [MTTS] something: That's...not what it says?

23:06 [MTTS] usfolks: Most people are secular. But other than that, the faiths have been combined.

23:07 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:08 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:08 [MTTS] Squidmind: It says that in the world of SC, the majority of people do not specifically have a faith.  The minority of people who have some form of faith are part of a religion that comprises of the various extant religions that over the past 300 years converged into a singular overarching framework that became known as His Chosen Path.

23:08 [MTTS] usfolks: It doesn't say that there is a lack of religion anywhere. But they do try to discourage people from playing a religous character because unless it's done right, it can end in proselytizing in the game, which we don't want.

23:08 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:08 [MTTS] Squidmind: Even in the real world, populations have become increasingly secular over the past 70+ years worldwide, this is just our interpretation of a continuation of that.

23:09 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:09 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:10 [MTTS] something: I understand not wanting to have people getting into heated screaming matches about religion in character, too, especially cause at the end of the day, they'd still be real life faiths people were insulting/making fun of/discrediting and or representing badly by yelling about them in the first place.

23:10 [MTTS] usfolks: Agreed something.

23:10 [MTTS] something: People tend to take that stuff out of character, no matter how you twist it.

23:10 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:10 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:11 [MTTS] Squidmind: We actually did have a very religious player a few years ago who created a very religious character who shared all their views - basically playing the player.  This resulted in a situation where a character in a world whose overarching religion was all about personal choices and not trying to convert people... tried to convert people in-game and got very, very angry OOCly when the game world did not support their efforts to turn the game their particular religion.

23:11 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:11 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:13 The starship transitions into another sector.

23:13 [MTTS] Squidmind: Basically, this is a sci fi space opera game about spaceships and aliens, it's not really the right place to have an in-depth discussion (whether roleplayed or real life) about religion.  Hence our creation of 'His Chosen Path', which basically boils down to 'in the end everyone wants to get along and after 300 years they kinda do, at least religion-wise'.

23:13 [MTTS] something: Thanks for leaving politics in though. Politics is fun!

23:14 [MTTS] valiant8086: My character is sort of like me actually, but he's probably better than the real me in pretty much every way.

23:14 [MTTS] Squidmind: Politics is horrible, but it's a part of everything!  You can't remove politics without removing basically every major decision people make in life.

23:14 [MTTS] davetaylor: Hell yes, politics is awesome.

23:14 [MTTS] davetaylor: Yes, it's horrible at the same time, I can go with that.

23:14 [MTTS] something: I enjoy talking about it,, though.

23:14 [MTTS] nadira: I hate politics, from the very bottom of my heart, so it is difficult to get my character to care about politics.

23:15 [MTTS] Butchulla: I do love the Politics side of things. Though it amuses me how sometimes small jokes in headlines or whatnot zoom right over my head because of where I'm from. I completely miss the US Politics humor if I'm not watching for it.

23:15 [MTTS] something: Even though it usually gets me generally pretty annoyed at the crazyness going on in the world, I still enjoy discussing and debating it.

23:15 [MTTS] usfolks: Who says that's humor?

23:15 [MTTS] davetaylor: Trump and Brexit in one though, that's class.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

23:16 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Artifact (nearest).

23:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:16 You turn on the silent running feature.

23:16 You turn off the silent running feature.

23:16 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

23:16 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.

23:16 [MTTS] Squidmind: There's a difference between 'politics' as in the thing politicians do that is usually annoying and 'politics' the thing that is vital to the actual running of nations, societies, etc.

23:16 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

23:16 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

23:16 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

23:16 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

23:16 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

23:16 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

23:16 You may not leave the starship while it is moving.

23:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:16 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

23:16 [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:16 [Outside Celestial Explorer]

23:16 You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to Celestial Explorer.
You are weightless here.
You carefully open the hatch and float outside.

23:16 You glance at the display screen of a spacesuit navaid and see...

   (4, 3, 14)

23:16 [Deep Space]

23:16 You see an intricately-decorated knife here.
You can go in any direction using a spacejet.
You are weightless here.
(15 seconds roundtime.)

23:17 Wait 11 seconds.

23:17 Wait 4 seconds.

23:17 Wait 3 seconds.

23:17 Wait 2 seconds.

23:17 Wait 1 second.

23:17 You pick up an intricately-decorated knife.

23:17 You put an intricately-decorated knife into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

23:17 [MTTS] Squidmind: Want to know the REALLY scary thing? The stuff with the AEU was partially set up due to player-driven events over the past several years.  The fact it started mirroring real life so closely was initially unintentional and somewhat concerning at the time.

23:17 [Outside Celestial Explorer]

23:17 You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to Celestial Explorer.
You are weightless here.
(17 seconds roundtime.)

23:17 Wait 15 seconds.

23:17 [MTTS] davetaylor: That makes sense, given the game history.

23:17 Wait 8 seconds.

23:17 Wait 1 second.

23:17 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

23:17 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.
[MTTS] something: That's actually pretty sad.

23:17 [MTTS] usfolks: I've heard you say that.

23:17 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

23:17 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

23:17 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

23:17 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

23:17 [MTTS] Butchulla: I wondered how much of that was intentional, and how much of it was scary mirroring.

23:17 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

23:17 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

23:17 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

23:17 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

23:18 You turn on the silent running feature.

23:18 [MTTS] Squidmind: From the pre-election to maybe a couple of months after the inauguration, we did stuff first, then it happened in real life.

23:19 [MTTS] something: Didn't the SC election happen first?

23:19 [MTTS] usfolks: See, that's just freaky.

23:19 [MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah...that's completely freaky.

23:19 [MTTS] Squidmind: After that we tried to diverge from reality and ended up settling from cherry-picking interesting things that made sense in the game world and trying to go our own way.

23:19 [MTTS] davetaylor: I think we had an idea that those things might happen, in our worst nightmares, in real life, I know neither of them surprised me.

23:20 [MTTS] nadira: Yeah, that was very scary, and what davetaylor said, I think we all were afraid of those things happening.

23:21 [MTTS] nadira: I have seen that before though, where my friends and I wrote a story where something happened, that did happen for real a few months later. Freaked us out.

23:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: Think of it this way, though: we're one game out of how many?  Hundreds?  Thousands?  How many of them have had elections in them?  I'd say that 99% of them have no connection to reality whatsoever.  Same with your story.  How many stories did you guys write?  How many came true?  We focus on the weird ones that do something that stick in our minds.

23:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: If that helps you feel a bit better about things.

23:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: We're definitely not from the future.

23:23 [MTTS] usfolks: Wait, you're not?!?!

23:23 [MTTS] nadira: Awh, and here I thought you were. Hehehe.

23:23 [MTTS] Squidmind: As long as there are no further followup questions: No.

23:24 [MTTS] davetaylor: Good, because I want teleporters before time travel.

23:24 [MTTS] usfolks: I have a followup question...ahem.

23:24 [MTTS] Squidmind: I would never use a Star Trek style teleporter.

23:24 [MTTS] davetaylor: I meant in life, not in game.

23:24 [MTTS] usfolks: I would. I can't drive. I would so have my molecules scrambled.

23:24 [MTTS] Squidmind: So did I.

23:24 [MTTS] Squidmind: You'd only ever use one once.

23:24 [MTTS] alc_71: I rather the time travel. People being able to teleport everywhere in a flash would be boring. You'd have people going out of comm range and zipping back just for beacons.

23:24 [MTTS] Squidmind: Then someone else would use it a second time.

23:25 [MTTS] Squidmind: Because you'd be dead.

23:25 [MTTS] usfolks: See...I prefer to think of it in more positive terms. Let's forget McCoy's fears and just go with 'Yes, this thing is perfectly safe, and while there should be accidents, there just aren't!'

23:25 [MTTS] Squidmind: I don't mean accidents, I mean continuation of consciousness.

23:26 [MTTS] usfolks: Well, there's that too. But what if there's something we don't know about consciousness?

23:26 [MTTS] davetaylor: Yeah, somehow the memories stay intact.

23:26 [MTTS] usfolks: Obviously Roddenberry was a time traveler. He would have known.

23:26 [MTTS] Squidmind: Bob is destroyed at point A, and an identical copy of Bob is created at point B.  Original Bob is gone forever, New Bob has all his memories but the consciousness is a new one.

23:26 [MTTS] Squidmind: Memories are just electrical signals and bits of neuron.

23:27 [MTTS] Squidmind: And there may be something we don't know about consciousness, but there's also no way to prove it either way.

23:27 [MTTS] Carroll: I love space concepts in general, flying to different planets, meeting new races and seeing where the edge of the universe if even possiblee.

23:28 [MTTS] Butchulla: I don't think I want to go to sleep tonight. I'm gonna dream of myself getting all split up into many many tiny pieces.

23:28 [MTTS] atherj: I've never watches star trek, but I would definitely never want a teleporter. I'm a babylon 5 time traveling fan.

23:28 [MTTS] Carroll: Like the theme in star Trek says, to seek out new life and boldy go where no man has goen before.

23:28 [MTTS] Carroll: Er gone.

23:28 [MTTS] alc_71: Beam me up staff but not really.

23:29 [MTTS] Butchulla: Oh, hell yes to babylon 5.

23:29 [MTTS] Carroll: Oo loved Babylon Five!

23:29 [MTTS] davetaylor: I still haven't watched that, since the last time we talked about it on here.

23:29 [MTTS] atherj: Everyone says if I liked babylon 5 I'd like stargate, but been way way too busy to ever even consider watching it.

23:29 [MTTS] Squidmind: Babylon 5's story is still great.  It's effects have really not aged well.

23:30 I don't understand that.

23:30 [MTTS] moose: Weren't there books based on it?

23:30 [MTTS] atherj: Unfortunately not, squid.

23:30 I don't understand that.

23:30 The ship's current engine speed is 5333 km/s.

23:30 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 33.8 seconds.

23:30 [MTTS] Squidmind: Books based on what, moose?

23:30 [MTTS] atherj: Far as I was told the books sucked.

23:30 [MTTS] Butchulla: You might actually. I know I didn't mind it when I took the time to watch it. But super busy means I haven't had time to delve for a while now.

23:30 [MTTS] alc_71: Both are great shows. Though I prefer next generation and voyager for Star Trek.

23:30 [MTTS] moose: Babylon 5?

23:30 [MTTS] Squidmind: Voyager is terrible.

23:30 [MTTS] Carroll: I also loved Knight Rider even though not space related, I love imagination and no not combat or even peopel fighting against each other.

23:30 [MTTS] davetaylor: DS9 is probably my favourite trek.

23:30 [MTTS] Squidmind: Oh, there are probably hundreds.  Most sci fi franchises have a ton of 'not at all canon' books.

23:31 [MTTS] atherj: Yeah.

23:31 [MTTS] Squidmind: DS9 was a great show, but terrible Trek.

23:31 [MTTS] moose: I think I'm going to start with the original trek. Even though I've been told to start with next generation.

23:31 [MTTS] alc_71: Na, Enterprise was the terrible one.

23:31 [MTTS] davetaylor: Start with TOS, definitely, and yes, Enterprise was bad.

23:31 [MTTS] Butchulla: Start with the original. Then move on from there.

23:31 [MTTS] Squidmind: Enterprise started off badly but got progressively better until it got cancelled just before it would've been amazing.  The 'grand finale' was awful though.

23:31 [MTTS] Carroll: I also love on this game the crafting stuff to and SSN I love that too!

23:31 [MTTS] atherj: And see, that's the problem with anyone who ever wanted to get into star trek. There are so many damn stories that who the fuck knows where they should start.

23:31 [MTTS] davetaylor: It had a couple of good episodes.

23:31 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, sorry. I just can't get into enterprise. Even if it does get better, I just can't get past the first couple eps.

23:32 [MTTS] alc_71: It was pretty bad. But so was the last season of Voyager.

23:32 [MTTS] Squidmind: Really you can just take each Star Trek series as its own thing and ignore the others, really.  There might be one or two episodes that have big call-backs to a previous show, but not enough to really alienate you.

23:32 [MTTS] Butchulla: Agreed, atherj. It's hard to suggest where someone should start.

23:32 [MTTS] usfolks: At least it's not star wars. Don't kill me.

23:32 [MTTS] Carroll: I remember a few like when picard became a kid and could nto use the space ship's computers.

23:32 Incoming hypercaster identification ping from Unknown Contact 914773072 at Northeast: Now identified as Jammer.

23:32 [MTTS] Carroll: Er not.

23:33 [MTTS] moose: Hmm.

23:33 [MTTS] Carroll: Star Wars the little that I knwo of it is ok to.

23:33 [MTTS] alc_71: Don't knock Yoda.

23:33 [MTTS] nadira: Yeah, I fell into the middle of next generation and with jst 2 or 3 episodes I could pretty much work out what it generally was about.

23:33 [MTTS] davetaylor: Apart from DS9 and Enterprise, you can pretty much dip in and out of trek.

23:33 [MTTS] usfolks: I can't get past the brother-sister kiss. SORRY!

23:33 [MTTS] Carroll: I would love to my char like one of those shows.

23:33 [MTTS] atherj: At least with star wars, as long as you know what order to watch the movies in, they're all based on the same general storyline.

23:33 [MTTS] Butchulla: Yoda rocks.

23:33 [MTTS] atherj: Even episode 3.5.

23:33 [MTTS] usfolks: Even DS9 you can do that until the later seasons.

23:33 [MTTS] valiant8086 has left the channel.

23:34 [MTTS] Squidmind: I think it depends on what you want from a show.  If you like cheesy optimistic space opera, TOS all the way.  If you like progressive optimistic philosophy, TNG.  If you want a dark, vaguely religious, vaguely shades of grey overarching plot, go DS9.  Voyager has like three good episodes, so I can't really recommend it.   Enterprise is also hard to recommend, but I love Shran.

23:34 [MTTS] rosey: I was away from keyboard doing stuff and got to thinking, one reason I want to make my char the way I was trying to is there are things that in real life because of my situation I can't do but would like to, in the game I can though.

23:34 [MTTS] davetaylor: A bit less so, but yes, it's the story arcs that make it harder, but they are awesome.

23:34 [MTTS] alc_71: I used to be scared of Darth Vader when I was young because of that breathing he had going on.

23:34 [MTTS] Butchulla: Squid, well put.

23:34 [MTTS] moose: Okay this answers a lot for me.

23:34 [MTTS] rosey: For example in real life I would not be allowed to freely pay music and entertain others but I would like to.

23:35 [MTTS] rosey: Play.

23:35 [MTTS] usfolks: Alc_71: I am your father. You kissed your sister!

23:35 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

23:35 [MTTS] atherj: Only avid star wars fans know how much that phrase is actually misquoted.

23:35 [MTTS] alc_71: It sure is.

23:35 [MTTS] usfolks: I know it's misquoted, but it was intentional.

23:35 [MTTS] Squidmind: Voyager is hard to recommend because it's internally inconsistent with writing, characterisation, and the actual plotlines.  Enterprise is hard to recommend because it starts terribly and takes a good season or so to start improving, and I can't really say 'watch these awful 14 hours of rubbish and then the next ones will be a bit better'.

23:36 [MTTS] atherj: Which star trek series had the sexy half robot chick?

23:36 [MTTS] Butchulla: Maybe not, but you did recommend a seriously good set of books though, so you're one up for that.

23:36 [MTTS] Squidmind: Voyager.

23:36 [MTTS] alc_71: Voyager.

23:36 [MTTS] atherj: That was voyager, right?

23:36 [MTTS] atherj: Oh.

23:36 [MTTS] usfolks: She was fully human with borg implants.

23:36 [MTTS] Squidmind: That was also like halfway through the seasons, too.

23:37 [MTTS] usfolks: As I have before, I will defend my Voyager. Har har har.

23:37 [MTTS] autumnrain has left the channel.

23:37 [MTTS] nadira: I think I have watched every star trek episode from TOS, TNG, DS9, voyager and enterprise by now, and then a friend got me into the fan made audio drama called starship excelsior which I love.

23:37 [MTTS] Squidmind: She's a cyborg, because she was Borg, so half robot is... technically accurate, if not entirely useful.

23:37 [MTTS] Squidmind: What about TAS?!

23:37 [MTTS] Squidmind: Everyone always forgets TAS.

23:37 [MTTS] usfolks: TAS?

23:37 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh!

23:37 [MTTS] Squidmind: The Animated Series.

23:38 [MTTS] davetaylor: I said that exact thing just the other day.

23:38 [MTTS] usfolks: I've only seen a few. It's available on Netflix though. I love the giant tribble in their version of TTWT.

23:38 [MTTS] Squidmind: It had a catgirl and a guy with three legs.

23:38 [MTTS] Butchulla: I liked TAS, but I know many many didn't.

23:38 [MTTS] Carroll: I used to love those super hero cartons.

23:38 [MTTS] nadira: I have heard of the animated series, never watched it though. Should see if here it's also available on netflix.

23:38 [MTTS] usfolks: I haven't seen it since I was 7. I won't say how old I am!

23:39 [MTTS] alc_71: I've watched them all at some point or other. I love Sci-Fi.

23:39 [MTTS] Squidmind: I loved it for what it was.  Also it had the Kzinti in it, which I vastly enjoyed.

23:39 [MTTS] usfolks: I read most of the books of TOS when I was growing up. They probably kept me sane. Diane Duane was amazing with them.

23:43 [MTTS] valiant8086 has joined the channel.

23:52 [MTTS] rosey: Another thing I have tried to play a char different than me, In real life I am very law abiding and I tried to play a criminal character once to the extent that a host, even though the hosts are very picky on ic and ooc being seperate, warned my char about losing his license when it could have be done and should have been given IC.

23:52 [MTTS] usfolks: They did you a favor...

23:53 [MTTS] rosey: We get warnings for doing similiar things.

23:53 [MTTS] nadira: Well, they of course wanted you to be sure that was what you wanted, as it would make your character rather unplayable.

23:53 [MTTS] Carroll: No they did not, they stifled her.

23:53 [MTTS] atherj: Always play a different char! My OOC me is a Catholic, for instance. My IC scientifically-minded me though, absolutely chortles at the concept of a God. Sometimes my conscience stabs at me when I do it, too like "how can you say this, man!" It's kinda amusing at times.

23:53 [MTTS] rosey: The warning could have been just as well been given in character.

23:53 [MTTS] usfolks: How did they stifle her? They warned her that if they continued on the same path, that's what would happen. But they didn't force her to stop.

23:54 [MTTS] davetaylor: You would have to bear in mind how criminality would be viewed in that gameworld, and they would be helping you with that.

23:54 [MTTS] atherj: Carroll, they did not stifle her. They just wanted her to know that in the IC world, there are consequences which could make her character completely unplayable.

23:54 [MTTS] Squidmind: When events reach a point where unplayability becomes possible, there is a sequence of events we try to go through to ensure a player is aware of the direction their character is taking.  One of these is an OOC aside to make sure they know what can happen.

23:54 [MTTS] usfolks: Not necessarily. In-character, they probably would have just yanked the license. They did you a favor. Please see it as such.

23:54 [MTTS] atherj: She could've continued down her current roleplay path if she chose.

23:54 [MTTS] atherj: And sufferred those consequences.

23:54 [MTTS] Squidmind: Carroll: It appears you already have a very unwavering opinion of us.

23:55 [MTTS] Carroll: I also find that there's way to many tropes so that you cant' do the profile like a good story and not some stilted short paragraph short on details.

23:55 [MTTS] atherj: Yeha. Do you play Miriani or something?

23:55 [MTTS] moose has left the channel.

23:55 [MTTS] Squidmind: Atherj: That's unnecessary.

23:55 [MTTS] atherj: Sorry.

23:55 [MTTS] rosey: I love the games and activities on here and really want to play.

23:55 [MTTS] usfolks: The tropes are not something you absolutely cannot use. My accepted profile had several. But you have to do them in a certain way.

23:56 [MTTS] Carroll: It just seems the help files to me are vague sorry I don't knwo how else to put it.

23:56 [MTTS] Squidmind: As for OOC asides, keep in mind that we do our best to separate 'Stop doing X' from 'If you keep doing X, Y will happen.'  The latter means you are welcome to continue, but with the player knowledge that there will be consequences.  Consequences are vital for good roleplay, both negative and positive.

23:56 [MTTS] atherj: Anyway, if the hosts did not come to you and tell you that you're in danger of losing your license, then there would be complaints instead from the characters of "oh, you guys didn't tell me this could happen and why didn't you tell me this could happen etc etc."

23:57 [MTTS] usfolks: And I've heard them before when people didn't get the aside they thought they should. People are going to bitch, moan, and whine, no matter what the hosts do.

23:57 [MTTS] usfolks: I think the two of you are making character separation and creating a character separate from yourself more difficult than it needs to be.

23:58 [MTTS] Squidmind: It's a fine line to walk and we do make missteps, we're not perfect.  But each time something happens we try to learn from it so that it won't happen again in the future.  We'd rather give someone an unnecessary OOC aside when they don't want it than NOT give them one when they would have preferred it.

23:58 [MTTS] davetaylor: Remember, they are spending their free time, to keep this game running, in the way it runs, which it has for many, many years, so they know what works and what doesn't.

23:58 [MTTS] usfolks: Also, please remember they're HUMAN. With human flaws, human faults, and they are capable of making human mistakes, as are we.

23:58 [MTTS] usfolks: And human feelings.

23:59 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, most of us are human.

23:59 [MTTS] nadira: Hmm, here's a strange comparison maybe. A guide dog is trained to help a blind person walk from place 1 to place 2 more safely, and if the blind person is gonna walk somewhere, where they might fall into a hole or something, the dog will pull back, like hey, it's not safe to walk there. But it's up to the blind person to trust the dog and try to figure out why the dog doesn't wanna go there, or to walk ahead anyway and fall into the hole.

23:59 [MTTS] usfolks: Right. I forgot. Forgive me, Liege.

23:59 [MTTS] davetaylor: And I've seen plenty of blind people tell their dogs off for doing exactly that.

23:59 [MTTS] Butchulla: Agreed on those points. Our hosts are human, and they give us their free time. So of course mistakes are going to happen, things will happen. I'd rather a host make a mistake than a host never make one if that makes any sense at all.
