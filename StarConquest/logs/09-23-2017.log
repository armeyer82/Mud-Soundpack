00:05:00 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

00:05:37 You glance at your communicator's screen.

00:05:37 There is one board post.

00:05:40 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:05:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.

02:04:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, it is, but it still tranlsates to gain. You get taxed like ninety percent on all those. So consider how much you made, and then imagine how much the alliance made."

02:04:58 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:05:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tickles you!

02:05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Because well, to be quite honest, they really are delusions, and you're kidding yourself if you're saying it's for the Accord. It's really not."

02:05:17 You chuckle.

02:05:20 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:05:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I... honestly prefer not to."

02:06:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That is.. imagine how much the alliance made."

02:06:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, like I said earlier, better that you wake up then live somewhere artificial. Delusions will probably only get you laughed at. Just sayin'."

02:08:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Basically, my suggestion is that you either join the strike, or you admit that you're doing what you're doing for the Union, because ultimately, it is for the union. There's no pressure, either way. We're not forcing you to do anything. We're just letting you know that in this particular instance, there is no middle. It's pretty much one side or the other."

02:08:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just hate for him to say this to new pilots."

02:09:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They are already struggling and it will just prolong their drudgery."

02:10:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is the mail on New Earth?"

02:10:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "East side of the spaceport."

02:11:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "East side?"

02:11:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Look around!"

02:12:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:13:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah ha. There it is."

02:13:30 You ask, "What is he looking for?"

02:13:35 You ask, "Or was looking for?"

02:13:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The mail room for goodness sakes."

02:13:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I mean he needs to look around and learn his surroundings."

02:13:54 You say, "Oh."

02:14:03 You say, "That's definitely a difficult place to find."

02:14:07 You laugh.

02:14:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Our spaceport isnot very difficult."

02:14:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:14:29 You say, "It's really not."

02:15:48 You say, "Sheesh, if he gets lost in our spae port, he's going to get hopelessly lost on Accord."

02:15:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Seriously."

02:16:03 You say, "Or the Torus."

02:16:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So, Ather, what can be done in this strike?"

02:16:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't always remember everything but I just don't say anything and go exploring around until I find what I am looking for."

02:16:47 You say, "Yeah, me too."

02:18:20 You say, "When I was first starting out as a pilot, I'd just fly to random planets and spend hours, just exploring to learn where things were."

02:18:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So did I and I used my Courier ship for most of that."

02:18:43 You grin.

02:19:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or mail delivery when I was a cadet but I wasn't a cadet fery long."

02:19:18 You say, "Maybe I should have him meet me by the river on Endymion. The one that's underground and all."

02:19:24 You chuckle.

02:19:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles at you.

02:19:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I still don't think I know everything on there."

02:20:33 You say, "I wasn't a cadet too long. I think a couple of weeks is all. I didn't want to stay a cadet very long anyways."

02:20:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:21:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I was a cadet for aabout two and a half days or so."

02:21:15 You say, "There's a cool camping place on Endymion that I still would love to try someday."

02:21:22 You say, "Wow."

02:21:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah let's do that sometime."

02:21:30 You exclaim, "That's not long at all!"

02:21:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope."

02:21:40 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:21:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:22:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

02:22:27 You say, "Yeah, we should. I'll have to see if I can remember where it is."

02:23:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, nobody moved the display cases, right?"

02:26:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where were the display cases?"

02:26:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They were in thespaceport, in front of the security offices."

02:27:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I didn't touch them."

02:27:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The drones were taking down the plaques, so someone put them in display cases."

02:27:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I can't see any display cases."

02:27:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they must have been removed."

02:30:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey allies."

02:31:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's everybody?"

02:32:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:32:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:32:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah me either but Drones will remove anything which resembles furniture."

02:33:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Constantine."

02:33:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, we just thought it was working because it took a long time for them to notice them I guess."

02:33:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:33:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine."

02:38:14 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:38:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm just kidding by the way, guys."

02:38:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

02:38:34 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:38:34 515,496.50 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:00 23 September 2317 GST]
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, I'm pleased to announce that thus far in the liaison term, the Union is responsible for 0 of 14 destroyed RATs nests and 0 of 12 salvage ops, representing an impressive 0% contribution by our corps. Unfortunately, we were responsible for 3 of 143 beacon drops and 22 of 333 asteroids hauled, representing 2.1% and 6.61% total contributions, respectively. These are rookie numbers! I know we can bring these down! [00:38 23 September 2317 GST]

02:38:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:38:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers.

02:38:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't begrudge new pilots working."

02:38:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:38:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't either."

02:39:13 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:39:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Even still Constantine, our performance was up over two thousand percent."

02:39:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, really?"

02:39:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, actually more like 2500 percent."

02:39:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."

02:39:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:39:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah but Eli I think last Conquest we had one pilot only who worked."

02:39:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'm proud of you guys for doing your work so well, even if you joined up at a weird time."

02:40:07 You say, "That's true."

02:40:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There was just one name on the conquest."

02:40:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I'll be honest, now that I see those numbers on the report you just gave.. I feel a bit better."

02:40:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess it wasn't hard with the insane deficit we somehow put up last time."

02:40:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."

02:40:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What was it, -500 over the -100 previously?"

02:40:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:40:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I think so."

02:41:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Only 3 beacon drops?"

02:41:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what it said."

02:41:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good lord, who the heck hauled 22 asteroids?"

02:41:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think Dakhal might still haul."

02:41:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When he's around."

02:41:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not me."

02:41:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Vernos heh."

02:41:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:42:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well... I know I did 5. So if only 3 got recorded... good."

02:42:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Tara also."

02:42:09 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:42:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, weird. I'm not sure why that could be, Johnathon."

02:42:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they haven't come through yet."

02:42:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Doesn't matter now. It's a new conquest."

02:43:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:43:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:43:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well sort of the report which the Voice receives is a cumulative report based upon the current term."

02:43:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:43:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's not the same as the whip reports."

02:44:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And in one of those Beacon drops.. I had a fighter destroyed."

02:45:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Do rental fighters count against the whole?"

02:47:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Probably. Since you're flying with the AEU transponder."

02:48:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:48:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Rentals don't count as negatively as aEU Combat ships would."

02:48:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But they still count?"

02:49:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:49:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "This is one reason, besides being able to obtain a few upgrades which you couldn't obtain at this point why we recommend rentals for those who are learning to fly in combat."

02:50:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:52:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'm sorry I slept so late, or maybe I would have thought we do another round of gunship fireworks, Eli."

02:52:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I should have known the numbers would be way up."

02:53:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:56:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where can I get cologne or something?"

02:57:41 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:58:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So... what is the best options for us cadets in this time of Strike? While keeping our score low?"

02:59:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd say just go all or nothing. No one is going to blame you for working."

02:59:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you actually want the Union to remain in the Accord, your best option honestly is to join us in the strike. Otherwise, you're basically working counter the rest of us and tacetly supporting the withdrawal."

03:00:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Mhmm. But, how do join in on the strike?"

03:00:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, if you want to do that, just don't do any work."

03:00:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Simple enough."

03:01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We still respond to sector invasions, but that's basically it."

03:01:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And drive pirates and rats out of places like Orion, maybe? But don't turn any rats cores in."

03:01:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And if you find merchants trying to trade at AEU ports, ask them to leave."

03:03:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So, basically, sit around a flight scanner and sit waiting and watching?"

03:03:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know it doesn't sound that great. But every one of chipping in on it helps."

03:03:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Pretty much. Also, partake in any protests we might be staging."

03:03:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can always go hang out in the lounge, too."

03:04:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

03:04:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:04:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There's some in that men's store in Manhattan and some manly sort of scents on Argley."

03:04:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh okay, cool."

03:04:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hopefully I don't smell like a prosecco-swilling bum."

03:04:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

03:04:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I had so much last night."

03:04:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:04:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:05:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:05:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well just get a good shower and use soap!"

03:05:12 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:05:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I should get a constructor or something."

03:05:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Those have showers, right?"

03:05:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah, gunships do."

03:06:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, gunship class ships and bigger do."

03:06:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. I thought module transports and constructors would too."

03:06:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're not gunships?"

03:06:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:06:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well gunships do, a Modular transporter does and a starliner does and yes a constructor does."

03:06:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope, they're carriers."

03:06:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:06:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oops mis-communication there."

03:06:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, actually, Lily's right."

03:07:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is carrier class bigger? If those have showers my carrier must, I guess."

03:07:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Some light cruisers do have showers."

03:07:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:07:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope carriers don't have showers."

03:07:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

03:07:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:07:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

03:07:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

03:07:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it's too late for now. Hopefully I don't stink."

03:07:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

03:07:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:07:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The least expensive starship one can probably obtain which has a shower is the modular Transporter."

03:07:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'll get a shower ship later."

03:07:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:08:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow I bought my first gunship so I could have a ship with a shower at least."

03:08:41 You grin.

03:08:56 You say, "I bought one of those portal showers from Helios. That was my first shower."

03:09:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I got one of those later but I wanted the deluxe one which is a little more expensive and I think it costa more than a gunship."

03:09:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Cost."

03:10:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:10:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident begins reading in a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

03:10:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I have a terrible question to ask. Could... all the tasks that get reported to be finished just be 'dismissed'?"

03:10:27 You say, "Yeah, they are more expensive, but I didn't have the combat points for a gunship at the time. I sucked at combat when I was first starting out."

03:10:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, but don't sweat 'em. Doing nothing going forward will be a huge help."

03:10:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh the gunship costs 65 mil."

03:11:24 You ask, "How much combat does it require though?"

03:11:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "250 industry and 100 combat."

03:11:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Not much."

03:12:13 You say, "Heh, yeah. I didn't even have that much combat at the time. I was almost scared to sign up for beacons and such."

03:12:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:12:19 You chuckle.

03:12:47 You say, "I was really good at shooting at empty space."

03:14:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:15:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:15:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:15:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The Module Transporter requires 20 Industry and 0 combat and costs 20 million."

03:16:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm betting a cadet can't get it."

03:16:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Now that's a cheap shower and living quarters."

03:16:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is glorious bet."

03:16:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You'd win."

03:16:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Get yours today while supplies last."

03:16:34 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:16:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:16:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope they can't."

03:17:09 You say to Lily, "I love you."

03:17:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm I want to see if I can set up a portable shower in the bathroom of the place off of the beach there."

03:17:32 Lily says to you, "I love you."

03:17:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

03:17:40 You say, "Ok."

03:17:46 You say, "Let's head over there then."

03:17:51 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:17:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "My extra one is pink though but it would at least be there for Cadets to shower in."

03:18:07 You grin.

03:18:10 Not much to see out there.

03:18:13 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:18:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:18:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:18:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:18:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:18:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They have no place at all! I was afraid to shower."

03:18:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh I don't think I have it with me."

03:18:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:18:35 You say, "Oh."

03:18:37 There is no planet nearby to land at. Please engage autopilot via the MOVE function.

03:18:37 I don't understand that.

03:18:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:18:39 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

03:18:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:18:41 You laugh.

03:18:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:18:44 You say, "Oops."

03:18:46 You grin.

03:18:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think Magellan may have it or I'll have to look around."

03:18:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:18:51 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:18:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:18:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:18:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

03:19:01 You say, "Ah, ok."

03:19:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:19:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:19:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:19:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Be right back."

03:19:12 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:19:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident scrambles to her feet.

03:19:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

03:19:14 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:19:39 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:19:53 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:19:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

03:19:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pats a portable deluxe pink shower unit lightly.

03:20:07 You grin.

03:20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So... what is everyone up to?"

03:20:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have a purple one but I won't give it up as we can't get these unless we see them on SSN."

03:20:21 You ask, "Now shall we head over there?"

03:20:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wait."

03:20:30 You nod.

03:20:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Let me look around a little more I might have a red one."

03:20:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

03:20:42 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sitting around in my ship."

03:21:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Something similar."

03:23:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, since they keep taking down our plaques, how about we just go and block the entrance off."

03:23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Woooo."

03:24:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "With what?"

03:24:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Your body, pal. Your body."

03:24:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, with our bodies."

03:24:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Everyone else's, too."

03:24:39 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:24:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

03:24:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pats a pink rubber shower mat lightly.

03:24:51 You grin.

03:24:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pats a pink rubber shower mat lightly.

03:24:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a portable deluxe pink shower unit lovingly.

03:25:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:25:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

03:25:10 You grin.

03:25:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Might have you end up in jail, though...I am sure they could find some reason to arrest you if you did that."

03:25:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:25:15 You're already sitting.

03:25:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably."

03:25:33 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:25:33 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:25:34 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:25:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:25:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:25:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:25:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:25:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:25:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:25:53 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:25:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:25:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:25:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:25:59 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:26:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:26:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:26:02 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

03:26:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:26:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:26:04 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:26:07 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

03:26:07 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

03:26:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "U nles ssomeone has a better idea? We could all go to another planet, and try to convince some folks. Maybe a place like Endymion, or Bikura."

03:27:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:27:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm surprised there's not even an outdoor shower on the beach there."

03:27:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:27:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, but it's a pretty busy spaceport hehe."

03:27:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:27:16 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:27:16 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:27:17 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:27:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "So yeah, out of the question. Since mostly civilina pilots do business there, and they already hear all the shit we're saying."

04:01:37 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

04:01:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:01:39 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:01:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:01:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:02:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's a chain on SSN with a broken heart on it."

04:02:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:02:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:02:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:02:16 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:03:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:03:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:03:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:03:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:03:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Does it have different charms?"

04:03:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:03:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:03:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

07:13:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I heard them say it was standing down."

07:14:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A siege has multiple waves sometimes. You didn't hear a message about the siege being broken right? Just standing down?"

07:14:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, no, just standing down. I didn't realize it was a siege."

07:14:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wasn't awake when it got announced."

07:17:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Depending on the debris... that is."

07:17:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess. Seems silly to waste ships trying to take it when there are better sectors that they frequently salvage from anyway."

07:31:00 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Thanks to members of all alliances who came to assist."

07:31:13 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure thing."

10:08:44 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Defenders are being scrambled to Beacon B-19!

10:17:13 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] Beacon B-19 is standing down.

10:21:58 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'll be up for a bit, so if that happens again, can bring the same ship in."

10:23:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm sort of sleeping on and off but I happened to catch that one."

10:23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you'll be up for a while I'll sleep easier."

10:24:06 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I mean, there's a lot of hours a day when nobody's around from one or more alliances, so we'd have no idea."

10:24:35 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh, gotcha. Well, that's what the Navies and Accord do too though. Fortunately we ain't the only defense."

10:24:46 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Very good job."

10:28:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Say, Eli, do you think I should try to push everyone to strike for 2-3 conquests?"

10:29:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We haven't really been pushing newer pilots, but that may just be prolonging things by not letting us present a united front."

10:29:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if we could go three in a row with absolutely no work if they'd start bargaining with us then."

10:31:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You think you can I would do that."

10:31:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, if you think you can then do it."

10:32:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sorry my speaking is a bit messed righ now."

10:34:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries, I think it's worth a shot."

10:34:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hadn't thought to press Johnathon on the issue, but Ather did and he agreed to strike almost immediately."

10:34:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe everyone would."

10:34:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, and e sure to that one up that just says something like this."

10:35:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Johnyhon was in on the strike before that he just didn't know everything works yet."

(You finish reading.)

12:58:19 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

12:59:00 You grab a large rubber stamp, pound it onto the 08:00 23/09 AEU space defense report, then fling the document into the Outgoing pile.

12:59:03 I see no "report" here.

12:59:07 I see no "report" here.

12:59:08 You grab the door handle as you leave.

12:59:08 The door to the west suddenly closes.

You can go north, south, west, and down.

12:59:11 You can't go that way.

12:59:12 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

12:59:13 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Flint" and the four-person mule "Lion's Den" are landed here.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

13:01:52 Board what?

13:01:55 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:01:55 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

15:39:04 Your communicator reports that...

15:39:04 
At least four recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

15:39:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:39:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:39:19 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:39:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:39:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:39:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:39:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:39:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:39:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

15:39:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:39:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:39:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:39:44 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:39:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:39:49 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:39:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

15:39:51 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

15:39:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:40:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:40:13 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:40:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

15:40:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:40:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:40:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:41:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

15:41:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:41:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:41:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:41:56 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:41:59 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:42:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

15:42:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:42:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:42:31 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:42:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:42:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:42:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:42:51 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:42:51 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:42:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:42:54 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

15:42:54 You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:42:55 You exit the ship.

15:42:55 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

15:42:58  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

15:42:58 You are carrying nothing.

15:43:08 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

15:43:08 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Melinda Michaels and Morris Corlew are sitting on a cushy booth seat. Erik Goodwin is standing here. Alko Delovega is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair.
You can go out.

15:43:09 Morris Corlew chuckles.

15:43:12 Alko Delovega smiles at you.

15:43:16 Erik Goodwin says, "If you want to nock out Telex, that's alright."

15:43:22 Morris Corlew smirks at Erik Goodwin.

15:43:22 Erik Goodwin says, "Kidding kidding."

15:43:23 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

15:43:25 You wave.

15:43:27 Erik Goodwin waves.

15:43:28 Erik Goodwin meanders out.

15:43:34 Morris Corlew nods to you.

15:43:41 Alko Delovega takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

15:44:21 Alko Delovega slumps in a comfortable wooden chair and goes to sleep.

15:45:08 Morris Corlew says, "Alright folks...would love to stay, but pretty soon I'm gonna need to prop my eyelids open with pins."

15:45:33 Morris Corlew says, "Which...sounds even more painful when ya say it out loud than when I said it in my head."

15:45:38 You chuckle.

15:45:46 You wave to Morris Corlew.

15:45:48 Morris Corlew stands up from a cushy booth seat.

15:45:50 Morris Corlew waves.

15:46:09 Morris Corlew says, "Good luck with Jameson's. If I hear it go off I'll try to rouse myself."

15:46:16 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "To bed."

15:46:20 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

15:46:21 Morris Corlew just went into the stairway to the garage.

15:46:25 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

15:46:31 You ask, "What happened at Jameson's?"

15:46:33 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

15:46:33 Seemingly wedged in the extra space between two other rooms, this lounge is very narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people. The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of each booth shows both a view of the landing pad outside and the latest news broadcasts. There is a stairway at the back of the room that leads to the garage.
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a salt lick, and a sanitation drone here.
Alko Delovega is sleeping on a comfortable wooden chair.
Melinda Michaels is sitting on a cushy booth seat.
You can go out.

15:47:20 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

15:47:32 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

15:47:58 You wave.

15:47:59 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]

15:47:59 You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

15:48:00 You key in a transport of Deadly Strike to your location.

15:48:00 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:48:01 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:48:01 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

15:48:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:48:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:48:02 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:48:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

15:48:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:48:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:48:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:48:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:48:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

15:48:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:48:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:48:36 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:48:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:38:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

16:38:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:38:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:38:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:39:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:39:04 I don't understand that.

16:39:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:39:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:46:49 You make a selection on your terminal.

16:46:50 What notice would you like to send to all AEU communicators?
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

16:46:53 Are you sure you want to send: Greetings pilots. It appears that earlier today, B-19 fell under attack from The Merry Band. While I don't know the details of what happened, I am pleased that civilian pilots did respond to the attack with a pulsar. Thank you to those who responded to defend AEU alliance space. Now, having said that, I would like to just offer a friendly reminder to watch out for the Navy in instances like that. Unfortunately, my reports showed that an AEU pulsar did fire on the navy. Just be mindful of what your weapons are locking on to. Other than that, keep it up and defending human alliance space is still extremely important. Take care and fly safe!

16:46:53 [Enter `yes' or `no']

16:47:07 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

16:47:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

16:48:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow yeah as even if it weren't aEU pilots who fired, it makes it appear that they did."

16:49:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't trust Morris and others so if we have someone else fly they aren't allowed to fly our combat ships."

16:54:49 Notice from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Please do not allow other pilots to fly SEAS Combat ships and if another pilot is flying during a siege, invasion, etc, be certain that they are flying their own Combat starship. Since our Navy was fired upon during these last incidents, it appears as though AEU pilots were firing upon the Navy. I don't want SEAS Combat starships compromised in this manner.

16:56:17 You say, "Because it wasn't the org's pulsar."

16:56:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It could have been, I have no idea."

16:56:36 You say, "Sec, I'll go look it up."

16:56:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Does it say which personnel were in those sieges?"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:10:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:10:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:10:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:10:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:10:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:10:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:10:17 Which sector did you mean?

19:10:17 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Subject: Striking
Author: Constantine Stone
Posted: 17:40 23 September 2317 GST
--
Allies, the strike has been wearing on for over a month, and it seems (at least to me) that it hasn't been very successful. Up until this point, most of us haven't pressured newer pilots into striking, but lately I've been wondering if all we're doing by not clamoring for 100% strike participation is postponing the inevitable.
 
I've mentioned this a few times on comms, but all we're proving with less than 100% participation is that we have no bargaining power. We can gnash our teeth and sit on our hands all we want, but the government knows that work will get done no matter what. As it stands now, I don't think we're making any positive progress.
 
What I want is for us to double down. Give me three straight conquests with not a lick of work done, and we'll see what the government has to say about it and go from there. Forget about what you have or haven't done up to this point; let's all stand together across the line and show them that we mean business. For those who are working, I understand that you became a pilot to work, but even working a little bit might be dragging this whole mess out unnecessarily. If you're getting bored, take to home space and turn transports around. I can take you guys out and we can work on rift navigation, or I'm sure Shule (or I, or several others) would be happy to fly practice dogfights in the si
19:48:01 mulator. I know this situation sucks, but right now it sucks and we're not even in control. Let's try to take control.
 
I notice that this conquest has already been tainted by work, but I think that's okay -- it gives us an opportunity to have a dialogue about this, which is what I want. What do you guys think? If you think we should consider another course of action, or if you have any ideas about things we can do to keep ourselves occupied, by all means post them here and we'll talk about them. I want to stress that I don't mean to demand anything by this post, just to lay out a suggestion. What I would like to see is us all agree to a plan by the end of the conquest.

19:48:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:48:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well Constantine, I'm very very conflicted about forcing new pilots to do nothing. I remember how the struggle was initially to get somewhere and this prolongs it. I'm concerned it may force our Cadets to turn and go home and we so need to grow our Corps, not discourage others."

19:48:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know."

19:48:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:48:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "WE've persisted this long and you are correct, the Government doesn't care."

19:48:36 Invalid selection.

19:48:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Believe me, so am I."

19:48:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Post about it, if you would. If many people feel this way, it would help if we all knew about it."

19:49:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then we can figure out what to do from there."

19:49:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:49:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So in good conscience, I cannot encourage Cadets and very new pilots not to work and those are the only ones who are currently."

19:49:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean I definitely feel that way too, I just know what we're doing isn't working."

19:49:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:49:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It isn't."

19:50:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:50:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I will put up our next Scooping station too and yes that's a form of work but so be it. We earn EAOS credits anyway."

19:50:57 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:51:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:51:06 You activate the long-range scanner and search for passive detections and recent ping returns.

19:51:06 --
Passive Long-Range Scan
--
No sensor signatures detected. A PING using the active long range scanner may reveal more, but is also likely to reveal your own ship's position.

19:51:09 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

19:51:09 A readout shows Asteroid Cluster 9810-5802 about 24.52 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southsoutheast and Very Slightly Up and Opik-Oort Signature 2169-9742 about 8.95 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southwest and Slightly Down.
A known beacon appears to be 4.93 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Slightly Down.
A temporary beacon appears to be 4.93 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Slightly Down.
A temporary beacon appears to be 5.03 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic North and Very Slightly Down.
A temporary beacon appears to be 9.48 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Northeast and Very Slightly Down.
A temporary beacon appears to be 5.14 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic North.
A temporary beacon appears to be 18.02 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic East and Very Slightly Up.

19:51:14 You say, "Oh cool."

19:51:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Evening, Constantine."

19:51:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Hmm?"

19:51:43 Mischief the large black felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

19:51:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Consider that if you want back on those stations, letting the scoop go down until the end of the strike might help."

19:51:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Rahab."

19:51:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How are you?"

19:52:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:52:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:52:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope nissi already said we're off and so I am not h holding out any hope that we'll be put back on."

19:52:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I really think we could get back on if we take the right steps."

19:52:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But you know them better than I do."

19:52:43 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

19:52:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Great, thank you. Taking the chance to do a little poking around while there's now ork ongoing."

19:53:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:53:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I do and they pretty much said they didn't do it because I put up the beacon in 777. They already had grudges."

19:53:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:53:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And all because of Morris."

19:53:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool! Yeah this is a good opportunity to explore home space a bit."

19:53:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Particularly, try to get around to all the stations mentioned in Ather's ship upgrades book if you can."

19:54:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not the mutuality ones, of course, but on a couple of the stations some people sometimes have odd jobs you can do."

19:54:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Stuff that's too small for the government to care about."

19:54:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "There's a ship upgrades book? I was looking for one, or one about ships in general, but hadn't found it. Guess I wasn't looking very hard."

19:54:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:54:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes it's available in both of the book stores."

19:55:43 Mischief the large black felo curls up and closes its eyes.

19:56:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:56:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:56:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I will wait for one week to put up the next scoop but it 's only going to hurt us and now help us. I seriously doubt anyone will do anything in our favor."

19:56:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Aha! Found it. Thanks, I wouldn't probably have noticed that if not for you guys."

19:57:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know that one week would cut it. What specifically does Nissi have an issue with?"

19:57:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like do you have a letter or something?"

19:57:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:57:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's one book that you shouldn't show to other Alliance pilots which is why it won't be placed in the Library boxes and if I find it there, I will discard it as it would not please Ather very much and for good reasons."

19:57:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean I'm trying to get in your business, but I would help if I could."

19:57:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:57:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So glad you found one."

19:57:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Sure, that's sensible."

19:58:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Too bad we can't get a bunch of them in the control room here and take them out with us like this and show them some things."

19:58:43 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

19:58:58 Lily says to you, "What were you looking for on the Long Range?"

19:59:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

20:02:00 You say, "Oh, just looking around."

20:02:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I meant to say I'm not trying to get in your business."

20:02:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone chuckles.

20:02:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

20:02:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hopefully that was clear from context, sorry."

20:02:43 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

20:03:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:03:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh at this point constantine, I don't care anymore. I have done so much for others and nobody really appreciates it so perhaps I am beginnign to think that I should be more selfish."

20:04:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I won't stop you, whatever you decide. But I think there could be a way back in."

20:04:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:04:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't."

20:05:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:05:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They will always find an excuse even if it's as flimsy as the last but if those with the power to say so say, then it is what it is."

20:05:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well Melinda said herself that letting us back in would be up to the AEU pilots."

20:05:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:05:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So when the strike is officially over you will certainly see what I mean as nothing will change."

20:06:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:06:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well pilots and it's one it's ather."

20:06:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:06:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So if Ather says no that's her excuse."

20:06:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, Ather has one very specific grievance. I think it might be possible to change his mind."

20:07:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just think giving up on this is going to make all our lives much harder in the long run."

20:08:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:08:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope he has always gone out of his way to belittle me. You see Ather is a very jealous man and obviously very bitter about his current circumstances."

20:08:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh see now you know org channels aren't private."

20:08:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

20:08:30 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

20:08:32 You say, "Yep."

20:08:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

20:08:38 You say, "Yeah, I figured."

20:08:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

20:08:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

20:08:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well."

20:09:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Damn."

20:09:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, I think it could still be done. If you stopped setting up the scoop, and maybe organized a protest or something, at an appropriate time, of course."

20:09:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then maybe sent him a letter asking if he might lift his ban on us. I don't know, I think it could work if you wanted to try."

20:09:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:09:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't htink it's up to me to organize protests I didn't start the strike."

20:10:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I get that you might not want to do that."

20:10:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, it shouldn't be up to you, I agree. I don't think you did anything wrong by setting up that station in 777, I'm just saying, I think this is a way we could get out of this mess."

20:10:44 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

20:10:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:10:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Did you even hear me Constantine? I already said I wouldn't put the next scoop up for a week but I know it won't make any difference but hurt the org."

20:11:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I heard you."

20:12:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But as I said, letting it go down for a week is not going to influence anyone. I would just forget about it and put it up immediately in that case. I'm saying that if you want to try to fix this, you should leave it down indefinitely. That's why I brought it up again."

20:12:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine, destroying a few ships should negate the work that was already done this conquest cycle. We should probably worry more about staging an emergency protest or something though in light of the latest headline."

20:12:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:12:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That means forever and so I might as well disband the org."

20:12:43 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.

20:12:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't even see it."

20:13:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'm ready to protest when you are."

20:13:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah. Looks like Rebane hated losing the election so much that now she basically wants to get into Best's back pocket. I always knew she was a fraud, but this cements it rather nicely."

20:14:23 They're just using you.

20:15:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, I'm not saying you need to commit to leaving it down indefinitely. I'm just saying that the outward appearance of us leaving it down during the strike will help your case."

20:15:17 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

20:15:26 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

20:15:26 A readout shows Fall of the 232nd Tikal Navy about 24.53 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southsoutheast, Asteroid Cluster 9810-5802 about 14.44 light-grand cycles toward Galactic East and Slightly Up, and Opik-Oort Signature 2169-9742 about 15.16 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Down.
A known beacon appears to be 18.63 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Northnortheast and Very Slightly Up.

20:17:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't pay close attention to their stances on the Accord before I was a pilot, but a few people led me to believe that while Rebane wanted to renegotiate a deal, she didn't want to outright leave."

20:17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think she'd try to make a legitimate effort to come to an agreement?"

20:17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, according to that headline, it looks like she's changing her tune."

20:18:43 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

20:19:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

20:19:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:19:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You are correct Constantine and Rebane is more conservative but I'd concede to her if she hasn't changed her view point to now support leaving Accord."

20:20:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh, that's disappointing."

20:21:12 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

20:21:31 You glance at your communicator's screen.

20:21:31 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, I didn't see the recent headline about Rebane taking over the negotiations before I made my debate post. This is now emergency territory. I urge everyone to drop all work for the next week and focus on protesting, instead. [18:21 23 September 2317 GST]

20:23:28 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

20:24:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:24:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "M/,issue Co|stantine is+ti,e. I a%$not:at work during mos% days and it's hard to_+n#w when I am availab&e many ]ornings. I couldn't run a prot-st e}f,rt for+d@ys."

20:24:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops."

20:24:39 You chuckle.

20:24:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

20:24:45 You say, "Not sure how much he got of that."

20:24:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

20:24:53 You laugh.

20:24:55 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

20:24:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

20:25:01 In the end, you can't really trust anyone but yourself, can you?

20:25:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know, and I totally sympathize wit[`,hat. I'm not ?ointing f/ngers at you Lily, r-all/. I'm just offering it as a suggestion. Like even if you were just the one to get one rolling, "t migh& help. In any case, being part of this big "ne /ther is planning will certainl\ help."

20:25:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm not stopping for these three spots but would rather go a little farther out to see what's there."

20:26:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Have noted them though as they may be worthwhile and they're not far away either."

20:27:29 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

20:27:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "When Constantine says I should organize protests what the hell does he consider the stations I put up as being?"

20:27:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Again all of these flimsy excuses and seems he's bought into them."

20:28:45 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

20:28:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

20:32:43 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

20:34:43 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

20:34:44 Lily says to you, "So guess what had we voted for Rebane now what would that have bought us."

20:35:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "D\mnit+.."

20:35:27 You say, "Ok."

20:35:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

20:35:31 You say, "Let's head back."

20:35:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

20:35:58 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 776."

20:35:58 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

20:36:09 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

20:36:09 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

20:36:09 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

20:52:44 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior pulsates gently.

20:53:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh well they have probably already had most of their discussion. Maybe Constantine will fill us in."

20:53:44 You say, "Hopefully, he will."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:57:09 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Tall yellowed grass surrounds you, dotted by sweetly scented, strange wild flowers. The warm, alien plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, and the planet's sun is beginning to set on the horizon. Two moons loom in the lavender sky. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

20:59:25 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:02:30 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:02:42 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

21:02:43 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 5830-3569 about 24.52 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Eastsoutheast and Very Slightly Down, Fall of the 232nd Tikal Navy about 1.44 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southsouthwest and Very Slightly Down, and Asteroid Cluster 9810-5802 about 22.82 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northnortheast and Very Slightly Up.

21:31:51 A reptilian-like creature flies overhead, producing a melodic trill as it passes.

21:32:39 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

21:32:45 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

21:32:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

21:32:53 You say to Lily, "I love you."

21:34:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well you see nobody believe me when I expressed reservations about Rebane."

21:35:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But yeah she seems to be a very far right conservative and it would go without saying that she wouldn't want other governmental involvement."

21:36:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wish I had a jamming device so I could interfer with certain temporary space station beacons heh."

21:36:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Interfere that is. I'd put 777 out of service."

21:37:02 You say, "Well, I wasn't going to vote for her anyways."

21:37:08 You say, "And yeah, that'd be nice."

21:37:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well me either but I'm saying that others were saying we should have."

21:38:09 You nod. "I know."

21:38:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We didn't have any decent options. We'd no longer be pilots if Garner was back and Rebane would have sold us to the cheappest bidder."

21:38:18 You say, "Exactly."

21:39:10 You say, "Morris thinks we should have voted for her."

21:39:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course and others."

21:39:25 You nod.

21:39:30 You say, "But Morris knows all."

21:39:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pierre even phoned me and said we should and I disagreed."

21:39:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course and Morris doesn't know it all."

21:39:52 You say, "I know."

21:39:57 You say, "I was being sarcastic."

21:41:11 You nod.

21:41:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd love to get in his face right now and say 'I toldya so idiot!' but I'll leave it to others to realize how stupid and unaware he is."

21:42:00 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the ship has passed outside communications range.

21:42:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We can catch autonav to 270 from 271."

21:42:11 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

21:42:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Woo."

21:42:17 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

21:42:17 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

21:42:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "How pretty."

21:42:18 The computer announces, "Autoforward beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Home Beacon Alpha 270 in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:42:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Let it auto."

21:42:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

21:42:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

21:42:45 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

21:42:48 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:42:49 You grin.

21:42:58 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:42:59 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:42:59 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:43:03 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

21:43:08 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

21:43:11 You say, "IO wasn't going to touch the controls."

21:43:11 The computer beeps and informs you that the ship is once again within communications range.

21:43:13 You grin.

21:43:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

21:43:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

21:43:33 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident softly on the neck.

21:46:21 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist..

21:46:31 You say, "Yep."

21:47:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The toll is like 20 mil, pretty hefty but these stations are expensive."

22:00:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

22:00:46 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

22:00:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But ifever that occurs with a League or Fringe ship, their SDC and Voice should know about it so that they will train their pilots more effectively."

22:02:38 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

22:02:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure wish it would point out which pilots engaged but unfortunately the reports aren't that specific."

22:02:56 You say, "YEah, it shows just the ships."

22:03:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When I get Ground Combat reports on nests and Bari Cleansing, it reports the names."

22:03:51 You nod.

22:04:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I sure would think it would be a good idea to list pilot crew aboard any combat related misison or type of work or incident."

22:04:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Mission."

22:05:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh well."

22:11:06 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

22:12:22 [MTTS] usfolks: Haha! I see that has been added to control rooms. I was not expecting that.

22:12:46 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

22:12:49 [MTTS] something: It happens anywhere as far as I can tell.

22:12:59 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

22:43:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

22:43:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:43:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:43:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:43:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:43:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:43:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:44:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident begins the docking sequence.

22:44:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

22:44:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:44:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:44:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Constantine, we were not able to hear the discussion very well between you,  Ather and Eli earlier. If you can summarize it for us, we'd appreciate it but comms were very garbled out there."

22:44:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:45:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

22:45:04 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:45:18 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. Anybody interested in the op, please come to the lounge for a minute?"

22:45:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Say what? CLose my eyes for a minute, and I see red alerts... lovely. What a way to wake up."

22:45:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "What?"

22:46:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, Eli and I were saying that Rebane getting appointed was confusing because we had actually been wishing she was in charge of the negotiations, since she has said before that while she wishes our deal with the Accord were different, she would still stay in."

22:46:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You alright?"

22:46:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Ather was saying we were crazy and that Rebane wants out."

22:46:46 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

22:46:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably dozed off in a sector with RATS in it, depending on what you were doing."

22:46:55 [Tactical Communication] Maya Hyru transmits, "Is it too late to get in on this op thing?"

22:47:02 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

22:47:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... once I woke up, realizing I am still parked in the garage, with the power off."

22:47:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

22:47:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah you guys really miss it on Rebane she is about as far to the right as they go and wanted to sell the pilot corps to the lowest bidder so yeah some have been listening to Morris too much or just ton't fathom how conservative she is."

22:47:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. if you are in the garage then you shouldn't have been seeing red alerts."

22:47:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or do you mean, when you powered the ship pu."

22:47:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "She can't be as conservative as Best though, right?"

22:48:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh you just didn't press the green button when you were last in combat. Easy fix!"

22:48:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I concure with that statement. I was grabbing a power nap, that's when I seen the red alerts. Man.. talk about a rush."

22:48:46 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

22:52:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:52:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Uh as little as possible. There's no time for work!"

22:55:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Coasting down the Riverway, trying to get my head clear and figure out something productive to do to stop Best. I had wicked dreams about infiltrator robots last night."

22:55:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And they really fucked with me."

22:56:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow that guy has been hitting the haze seriously."

22:57:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Iniltrator robots?"

22:58:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Here I was thinking Red Alert going off was pretty bad..."

22:59:08 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok folks. Op is gonna be one up from the beaconed sector at 285."

23:16:47 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

23:16:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

23:16:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:16:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

23:16:55 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

23:17:05 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

23:17:05 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:17:06 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:17:15 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

23:17:18 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:19:25 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:20:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't you wish the government would open a discussion with us so we could all be in that op right now?"

23:20:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sure would make the alliance a lot of money."

23:20:47 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

23:21:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:21:15 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It sure would but our government does not care about how much in the way of raw materials we can bring in nor the income."

23:21:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:21:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They especially don't care about what we can do in the defance of humanity as well!"

23:22:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Defense or defiance?"

23:22:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:22:50 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope defense of humanity. I do not defy humanity."

23:24:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:24:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Now Rebane who wanted to sell our Corps to the lowest bidder is showing her true colors."

23:24:04 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:24:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess they think the Outsiders will ignore us once we no longer have no allies, the way they've been ignroing us."

23:24:59 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:25:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:25:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh i'm sure they're listening and i'm sure they are ready once we have no other alliance to come to our aide."

23:26:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've never quite understood that Lily, I've heard you say that before, why would anything ever go to the lowest bidder? Why would they take a lower offer over a higher one."

23:26:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "In one way or another, they're selling out our Corps..."

23:26:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:26:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I believe in our Navy but there are circumstances when all military resources need to come together and Outccord is not the answer."

23:26:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:26:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "She wanted to privitize us and that's how privitazation works."

23:27:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Our navy is strong, but they shouldn't have to face the threat of extinction without allies."

23:27:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am a bit fearfull that they'll sell us out, in the end.. with the strike."

23:27:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But what does that mean? That means there's a bunch of bids, and they look for the one they'll make the least money on?"

23:27:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:27:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That means being contracted out and cotracting firms always! Always bid the lowest and provide the lowest quality of work."

23:27:49 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

23:28:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I just thought it meant that the corps would be owned by a corporation instead of the government."

23:28:49 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

23:28:59 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:29:07 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:29:08 A readout shows Asteroid Cluster 9810-5802 about 21.86 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southeast and Very Slightly Up and Opik-Oort Signature 2169-9742 about 7.65 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westsouthwest and Slightly Down.
A known beacon appears to be 6.63 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Up.

A temporary beacon appears to be 8.51 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic North.
A temporary beacon appears to be 18.31 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic East and Very Slightly Up.

23:29:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, that's still obviously not a good thing. I just thought the corporation could do whatever they want with it though."

23:29:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:29:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The only exception is if a contracted firm has expertise which the government simply cannot provide but there's no reason why the Government can't still support us."

23:30:50 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

23:31:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though there was that oe corporation that was funding the explorer's corps, we never found out what that corporation was, did we?"

23:31:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No I don't think so."

23:32:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still think it was Best."

23:32:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well... If it ends up happening anyways, maybe that would be at least nice."

23:32:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, yeah, not Best's corporations, hell no."

23:32:49 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

23:32:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I tried to send Rebane a letter a few minutes ago."

23:33:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess she doesn't accept mail from us."

23:33:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:33:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Naa it was a joke I believe as nobody has ever seen the Magnitor."

23:33:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, it's just the description in the shop totally sounds like Best's rhetoric."

23:34:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I'll probably never get to fly a Magnetar now..."

23:34:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:34:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well eli if we were privatized, we wouldn't also be able to perform our work as well as our resources would be additionally limited there would be lots of budget issues."

23:34:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think there's any reason to believe that."

23:34:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think people hate the idea of privitization, which is fine, but we really don't know anything about it."

23:35:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It all depends on the company."

23:35:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:35:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I doubt any of us will and i'm sure some of us have earned it."

23:35:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "How holariously naive."

23:35:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If we were privatized.. I'd bet many pilots would leave and go to another alliance."

23:35:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, they certainly would."

23:35:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If I didn't like the company, I might."

23:35:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't think that companies care more about their profit margins than they do about you? You relaly need to wake up and join the real galaxy."

23:35:49 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

23:35:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think the people we work for now care about us?"

23:36:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:36:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well we don't have the option to go to another alliance but guess there is another way to pilot."

23:36:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's the difference, and why is it worth crying about?"

23:36:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not really."

23:36:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No, but at least we don't work for a bunch of credit mongres. We work for our alliance. There is a difference between working for our alliance, and working for a bunch of idiots in a suit who don't give a shit about anything except your levels of production."

23:36:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are we living in the real galaxy right now? Because piloting life currently blows."

23:37:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't see that Best cares about our levels of production at all."

23:37:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or anything we do."

23:37:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Best is not the alliance."

23:37:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not sure folks would migrate, but we'd probably see some folks retire."

23:37:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But he does control us."

23:37:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ather. I am pretty sure they care more about the profit margins then they would about the pilots that fill those margins."

23:37:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm pretty sure this is already out reality."

23:37:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Our."

23:37:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

23:37:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right now, they don't seem to care about either."

23:38:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The people we work for certainly don't care about us individually."

23:38:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "He doesn't control us. Otherwise he'd have stopped those of us who are on the actual strike. He'd have imposed harsher punishments on those of us who have blown up ships. If you work for a company, they will probably make you pay the full cost of that ship if you blow it up. Good luck with that one!"

23:38:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:38:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep they will care even less if we work for a private firm as well."

23:38:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess we can speculate, but I don't see how any one we work for could care less about us than our current employers."

23:38:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's all I'm saying."

23:39:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:39:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

23:39:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fuck that. I urge the rest of you not to share this mentality!"

23:39:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right now, Best has to work within the rules. That's the biggest part of trying to get out of the Accord, is so he'll have even less of them."

23:40:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:40:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok we'll probably go out of the tolerable of communications clarity before long so see you later Constantine as we're just out exploring for awhile. No idea where wer're going nor when we're coming back!"

23:40:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, have a good trip."

23:40:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'd certainly love for them to show me that I'm wrong."

23:40:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

23:40:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Probably more than anyone."

23:41:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:41:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We all would but we're expendable as when we're gone, they can recruit more."

23:41:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's one thing Ithink we all agree on about Best, no matter our reasons. He has to be stopped before he takes all our freedoms away, one by one, until he has complete control."

23:42:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If not stopped, then at least reigned in."

23:42:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Eli, if he tried to take those freedoms away, there would be war."

23:42:50 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:43:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:43:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Huh war war against whom?"

23:43:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Civil war."

23:43:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's gradual. Like the Ministry of Facts deciding what knowledge we are allowed to know, or putting pilots in battlesuits to fighten people into compliance."

23:43:51 Mischief the large black felo jumps into Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap and settles in, purring.

23:44:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:44:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well there would have been more going on i'd say if the average citizen cared enough."

23:44:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, people are dead. I think it's definitely heading that way."

23:45:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It sounds like civil war is already on the horizon."

23:45:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I concure with eli."

23:45:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And it might spell the end of the Union."

23:45:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "At least in its current form."

23:45:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:45:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's true and it will likely become a number of factions."

23:45:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Or, at least the End of the Unions Civilian Pilots."

23:45:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:45:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well there already are but more defined."

23:45:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or get subsumed by other alliances."

23:46:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. there's two star systems, so I'm not sure how many factions there would actually be, but you could be right."

23:47:07 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

23:49:20 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:49:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

23:50:07 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

23:51:09 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

23:51:10 A readout shows Fall of the 232nd Tikal Navy about 23.94 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southsoutheast, Asteroid Cluster 9810-5802 about 14.38 light-grand cycles toward Galactic East and Slightly Up, and Opik-Oort Signature 2169-9742 about 15.69 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Down.
A known beacon appears to be 19.21 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Northnortheast and Very Slightly Up.

23:54:11 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

23:54:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gently caresses your neck and shoulders.

23:56:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So weird that we're so close to Fringe stuff."

23:57:13 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

23:57:51 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.

23:58:30 You nod.

23:59:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sort of think that we'll find more related to us by going more Westward."

23:59:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or rimward but obviously not that far."

23:59:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
