-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I'm pleased to see you engaging
in Ground Combat work. However, please be certain to observe your battlesuit's
damage, repair in between battles, take cover if your damage is high and if you
don't have the REPAIR ability on your Battlesuit, use Repair drones to obtain
enough repairs. Also, launch and obtain a repair from the Battlesuit Outfitter
if the damage is too high to repair. If you need tips on managing your Ground
Combat tactics, please seek us out and ask questions. On the conference room
table of the Liaison Office building, there is a box which contains two
different books on Ground Combat. Please read these books. The Battle Scanner
West of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector and the Salvage processing stations
east of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector will be renewed in a few hours. Please
be certain to Transfer after you have completed your salvaging work. If you are
uncertain as to how to access these stations, just ask us and we'll assist you.
Fly safely and fight hard on the ground! [19:46  3 April 2318 GST]
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: AEU pilots: having not received a lot of
letters from people telling me about times of availability, I'm just going to
set up a meeting. If you all can come, great. If not, I don't want to see
letters or messages from people saying "well, that time was not good for me."
You all were given the option of sending me your times of availability. All that
being said, the meeting will be on Saturday, at 19:00. This should be a decent
time for pretty much all people who have weird hours of wakefulness and
activity. The meeting is to discuss the current status of the AEU pilot corps,
and to see if we can find some common ground to end the devisiveness between
pilots in the corps. I also have some information that I would like to share
with the rest of the pilots related to some discussions I had with Keegan on the
most recent expedition. I hope to see you all there! Remember, Saturday, 19:00,

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings Everyone! The Battle Scanner West
of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector and the Salvage processing station east of
the Steel Phoenix Command Sector are now renewed and functional. After you have
completed your salvaging work, please be certain to Transfer your debris to this
Salvage Processing station. Then when the Transfer of debris has completed, be
certain to exit your Starship and go up to the Control Room of the Salvage
processing Station and press the TRANSFER Button so that your Credits and Points
will be sent to you. Regarding the Battle Scanner West of Steel Phoenix Command,
You should not attempt a Beacon Drop until you have received instructions from
someone who has performed Beacon Drops before. If you are uncertain as to how to
access these stations, just ask and we will assist you. These Temporary space
Stations are sponsored by the SEAS and Starseekers Organizations. Fly safely and

Hello,
Currently we are maintaining Salvage and BAS Stations East and West of Steel
Phoenix Command. If your organization would like to participate, please load two
of each of the following: Basic Control Center top, Storage Container Unmanned
Pickup Modules and Cores into SEAS Warehouse or onto a Module Transport and send
me a key which I would distribute to Shule and Constantine who are SEAS Trustees
and assist with station building at times. Also, please try to maintain that
there are two of each of these modules on hand most of the time as These
stations will be replaced about every 12 days.
These stations are not teeming with activity. However with the current presence
of a number of new pilots in both AEU and Fringe, these Income-producing
Temporary Space Stations have the potential to yield greater activity and Income
and Megacredits for all involved.
As for the Alliance Core Module, we will alternate with Fringe and AEU Cores on
these stations
The following would occur. for one cycle of stations, the BAS would contain a
Fringe Core and the Salvage Processor would contain AN AEU Core. Subsequently,
this would be reversed for the next build of these two Temporary Stations as
they would be alternated per each cycle of stations.
By having Tops and Ejecter Modules, on hand I could assure that both RUNE and
ICE would always be incorporated into both of these Temporary Stations.
If there is a future consensus amongst us to support an Asteroid processor and
for special occasions when there are artifacting trips/pilots express more
interest in artifacting, we can establish a Xenology Station. The Xenology
Scanner Module is a very expensive Module. The current one which Starseekers can
obtain costs 14 Megacredits. Therefore, it is not very justifiable at this time.
Please let me know your thoughts, concerns or if you'd like to participate, etc
as soon as possible.
I will be replacing the BAS and the Salvage Processor stations sometime tomorrow
and I will wait until around 1400 for your response.
Kind regards,
Lily Kaies

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots: we have a couple reminders to bring
before you for today. First and foremost, we have a meeting tomorrow at 19:00,
in the New Earth conference room. All pilots, cadet and otherwise should
consider coming, as the meeting will, in my opinion be reasonably important.
Secondly, I would like to remind all pilots, cadet and otherwise to keep your
ships powered down and off of the landing pad when they are not in use. Failing
to do that, could cause a Bari infestation to rapidly spread if there is
suddenly an outbreak of Bari infestations, which does tend to happen from time
to time. [00:16  7 April 2318 GST]
