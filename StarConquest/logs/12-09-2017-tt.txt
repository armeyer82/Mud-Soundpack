Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source,
woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of
the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs
draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist,
smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval
turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with
a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it here.
You can go out.

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

[Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]
This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced
with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and
the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air,
thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small light
blue trash can, a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star
quilt on it, a blue plastic table, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a
felo nutrigel dispenser unit, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a dark metallic red cold beverage machine, a
silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, Viviette the
violet felo, a small Bari-shaped tidbit, and a small yellow ball containing a
realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.

Glaring spotlights in the upper corners of this docking bay illuminate every

framework of massive steel girders left exposed except where hydraulic,
electrical, and ventilation systems encased in heavy metal ducts are attached to
the walls. Large cables extend across the solid metal floor from massive
batteries along the south wall of the bay, snaking toward individual starships.
To the north is the massive airlock for docking and departing ships, and to the
south is the single airlock for those venturing into the station. The air is

Melinda says to Elaine, "For example, some did a photo album of various shots
and sold it to raise funds for our community outreach fund."
Wendy says to Kani, "I might've scraped one of Morris' or Melinda's ships on
takeoff, but that was on purpose."
Morris Corlew laughs.
Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

Morris Corlew says, "I bout scraped Akemi's ship good goin into Accord once."

Morris Corlew says, "Sure didn't look it from where I'm sittin."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Nope. The whole point of it is personal choice."
Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Kani Kahakai nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Melinda Michaels says, "She is missing the point. It may or may not have to do
with, um, other things."
Morris Corlew says, "Guess she didn't wanna argue this time."
Nissi Valdaire says, "She wanted to argue, just didn't want to hear a rebuttal."
Morris Corlew says, "Well...yeah, that's more accurate. But often she sits and
squints when she hears it."
Morris Corlew says, "Instead of leavin."
Nissi Valdaire grins and shrugs.
Kani Kahakai says, "I mean... she was going on about her catsuit in front of
everyone the other day... when she was in a playful mood."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, she was."
Kani Kahakai says, "I think just in an argumentative mood today."
Damien Alexander nods to Kani Kahakai. "Everybody gets that way sometimes."
Kani Kahakai nods.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Sometimes I get a vibe that she's got a personal issue
with me but I have no idea what that'd be."
Melinda Michaels says, "I dunno either."
Kani says to Nissi, "You're too quiet to have personal issues with."
Morris says to Nissi, "Well...she seems to have one with me too, so...I dunno. I
can't express an opinion differs from hers in any way without her thinkin I'm
tryin to argue."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Just this random combativeness about things I take a
position on. Maybe I'm just taking it too personal and she just doesn't handle
trips well."

it and left."

a bit. I guess."

and stuff."

A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles
overhead.

beneath the ocean waves.
Kani figets.

The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.

An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of
machine-gun fire.

mangled stump where his right arm once was.
A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock
rifle slung over his shoulder.
The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct
hits.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys stands up from a large leather couch with a
hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves south.
You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.
You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place
seems to go on forever.

Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night.
Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.
The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.
[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "Nissi, that's the most words I've ever heard you string
together, I am moved."
[PA] Nissi Valdaire: "I'll move your face."
Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she whistles.
The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't
be felt.
The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.
[PA] Kani Kahakai: "If you're lucky."
[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "Keep the plasma bomb, ghost man, cherish it while it's still
maybe under your pants."
[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "In some dimension, I'm sitting in it anyhow. And that's what
matters."
[PA] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys: "Indeed so."

Damien smiles weakly at you and nods.
Damien says to Lily, "Er, just how chummy?"
Lily says to you, "Well I believe the same holds true for you too! It's just not

Damien Alexander asks, "She told me she wanted some space, before the
artifacting trip. She barely talked ta me on the way back, which is part of why
I stayed in my ship most of the time. I revoked most of her copies of my ship
keys, an' when she got back she freaked out. Said she thought I'd given up on
her or somethin'. I was just doing what I thought she wanted. Ta be apart from
me. So she says she wants ta work on us, but needs time ta sort herself out or
something. An' in the background she's messin' around with somebody else?"

You wave to Kani Kahakai.
Nissi says to Damien, "I'm not gonna keep after this with you if you don't wanna
hear it, but if you want me to answer any questions or just tell you what I
know, lemme know."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Pierre did declare himself captain. It's all on him."
Lily Kaise grins.
Lily Kaise nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Damien says to Nissi, "I was just talkin' about it with Shule an' Lily here. I'm
gettin' weary of the whole damn thing but I need ta know the truth, as much as
it's possible ta know it."
Damien says to Nissi, "It's really startin' ta look like I'm the chump in the
equation, an' that ain't where I wanna be fer all kindsa reasons."
Nissi Valdaire nods.
Nissi Valdaire asks, "Wanna go somewhere else and talk then?"
Lily Kaise smiles and waves to Kani Kahakai.
Damien sighs quietly and shrugs. "We can talk here. I already discussed it with
Lily an' Shule an' I think almost everybody knows more'n I do anyhow."
Nissi Valdaire says, "All right."
Nissi Valdaire gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Well. Lemme describe this first of all and I guess you can
see if any of it rings true."
Damien Alexander nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I'll cut out the speculation."
Damien Alexander puts a goblet in a small light blue trash can.
Damien Alexander examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.
Kani Kahakai sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow
with thick silver fringe.
Damien Alexander helps himself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape
Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.
Nissi Valdaire says, "She and Eli got flirty on that trip we were on to find
Aisling's people."
Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.
Kani Kahakai stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe.
Damien Alexander blinks. "That's goin' back a ways."
Kani Kahakai sits down on a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered
silver stars.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah."
-kani We don't bite. Well, Lily doesn't but I do.
You say to Kani, "We don't bite. Well, Lily doesn't but I do."
Damien Alexander asks, "When was that? May, June?"
Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape
Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Not sure. Definitely several months ago."
Damien Alexander nods.
: sits back and listens quietly.
Shule sits back and listens quietly.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Melinda talked to him on her own I think near the end of
the trip and found out they were pretty much together at that point and she told
me. Cuz we had our own suspicions even then about what Evenia was up to and we
were concerned."
Nissi Valdaire says, "So after the trip, I talked to him myself. Cuz he's been
my friend for you know, years."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Damien mutters, "Sanity..."
Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape
Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.
Nissi Valdaire asks, "I was just like... so you and Eve are a thing now huh?"
Nissi Valdaire asks, "And he goes, yeah, was it that obvious?"
Lily Kaise blinks.

You blink.
Nissi Valdaire says, "But now here's the thing and I'm really curious if any of
it is gonna sound familiar to you."
Nissi Valdaire says, "We weren't supposed to know. Nobody was. He really wasn't
supposed to tell us."
Nissi Valdaire says, "She told him it was nobody's business, nobody needed to
know, and she'd just be happier if it was all kinda kept on the down low."
: nods thoughtfully to himself.
Shule nods thoughtfully to himself.
Damien says to Nissi, "You got that from Elil."
Lily makes a discusted face.
Damien Alexander coughs. "Eli."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Which Melinda can tell you she's said to past boyfriends
too, like Corey."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, straight from Eli."

Shule covers his face with his hands.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Jeez."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in AEU/Common Knowledge.
Damien clenches the hand that's not holding the goblet into a fist.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Eli and I talked... two or three times about all of this."
Nissi Valdaire says, "He'd get suspicious too about who she was spending time
with."
Nissi Valdaire says, "You, Johann, even Vernos at one point."
Damien Alexander subsides into silence as his eyes grow large and round, and
eventually glaze over. Time passes.
Damien Alexander asks, "Eli'll be interested ta know he ain't the only one
either, huh?"
: nods solemnly.
Shule nods solemnly.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Now I dunno the truth of her and anybody besides you and
Eli."
Lily Kaise says, "Heh maybe he um..."
Nissi Valdaire says, "He would, but I think Eli has drunk the koolaid at this
point."
Damien Alexander says, "So he'd think I was lying."
Nissi Valdaire says, "At some point or another she always gets these people
isolated and then they start not only wanting to believe her but also lying for
her."
Damien mumbles, "Isolated..."
Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.
Kani Kahakai frowns.
nod
You nod.
: starts to say something then stops.
Shule starts to say something then stops.
Damien Alexander says, "I definitely been isolated. Some of it was my own idea.
But Eve gets negative sometimes, basically disassociates with people, says shit
about them, an' then I disassociate with 'em too."
Nissi says to Damien, "Now I told Eli back along when he had worries that he
should go to you with all this."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Because I could see say Johann lying about being with her,
but I really didn't think you would."
Damien Alexander says, "An' I ain't wanted ta believe the shit people been
saying about her, but I've gotten similar stores from quite a few by this time."
Damien says to Nissi, "Johann? Really?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "But at some point I think he decided he preferred not to
find out the truth."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Eli was pretty worried about Johann, yeah."
Nissi Valdaire says, "And they did spend a lot of time together for quite a
while. But there's nothing but speculation there."
Elaine Moreau slinks in from the south.
Kani Kahakai smiles at Elaine Moreau.
Elaine Moreau sits down on a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered
silver stars.

You wave to Elaine Moreau.
"Right, just cause somebody works with somebody else a lot don't mean there's
anything more there." Damien Alexander nods to Nissi Valdaire. "There might be
but that alone don't mean nothin'."
Elaine Moreau strokes the soft fur of Viviette the violet felo.
Viviette the violet felo purrs and rubs its head against Elaine's hand, looking

Viviette the violet felo seems to be hungry.

dispenser unit. It begins churning violently for several moments before
producing a small glob of nutrigel.
Viviette the violet felo eats some of the nutrigel.

Damien Alexander says, "I know I ain't been working with too many different

You chuckle at Melinda Michaels.
Elaine Moreau squints at Melinda Michaels.
Nissi Valdaire says, "But we do know we've got both you and Eli thinking you're
in an exclusive relationship with the same person."
Nissi Valdaire says, "So... that's at least two."
'That's ... what... she... never mind.
You say, "That's... what... she... never mind."
Damien Alexander says, "That's enough ta get her in trouble in my book."
Lily Kaise nods to you.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Damien Alexander says, "I wanna know the truth, even if it hurts. Because if the
person I care about an' trust the most has been fuckin' me over fer, months? I
need ta know that."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I just don't want to see people getting lied to. That's
kinda my thing. Do whatever, as long as it's honest."
-damien She did the same thing with Corey.
You say to Damien, "She did the same thing with Corey."
Damien Alexander growls.
Damien says to Melinda, "I promise ya I won't hit yer walls. I won't promise ya
I won't hit the walls in my Cipactli. That alright?"
'Ok. I think I should shut up now. I've already said way too much.
You say, "Ok. I think I should shut up now. I've already said way too much."
Melinda says to Damien, "All I can tell you for certain is that a couple of us
tried to get Eli to steer clear. I told him you were in the picture. For
whatever reason, he isn't believing."
Damien says to you, "No, if you got information, real, honest information, I
wanna know. I wanna know how deep this goes."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't know much about the Corey thing. Only stuff I know
about firsthand is with Eli and now you."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, Eli doesn't believe."
Damien Alexander says, "I want people ta not lie to me. The rest I'll deal
with."
-damie She swore Corey to secrecy.
You say to Damien, "She swore Corey to secrecy."
Nissi Valdaire says, "When I advised him to talk to you, he talked to her
instead, and she reassured him somehow."
-damien That's why very few people knew they were together.
Lily Kaise shakes her head.
You say to Damien, "That's why very few people knew they were together."
Damien says to Nissi, "Same way she reassured me, probably."
Nissi says to Damien, "Probably."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I dunno how she does it honestly."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I couldn't sleep at night."

Nissi Valdaire says, "Gaslighting and guilt trips I would guess."
Lily Kaise shrugs.

You nod to Nissi Valdaire. "That'snot far from the truth."
Damien Alexander says, "I'm a jealous guy. I ain't proud of it. But I told her I
was upset cause she seems ta always have friends ta go hang with, her phone's
always ringing, an' me, I got like two friends. I forget how she explained that
away. Then she's tellin' me she feels trapped, wants some space, cause I was
gettin' mad she was spending time with people other'n me. Like I barely saw
her."
Damien Alexander says, "I revoked a few of her keys ta my ships an' she about
lost her mind. So I gave a couple back, like an idiot."
'Well, this doesn't help you not be jealous. That's for sure!
You exclaim, "Well, this doesn't help you not be jealous. That's for sure!"
Lily Kaise nods.
Damien stares at his boots. "She made me believe she still loved me."

Nissi says to Damien, "Anyway I say get you and Eli and a mediator in a room.
Maybe with Eve too, maybe not, but definitely with a mediator who knows what's
up with all of you firsthand."
Viviette the violet felo stares curiously up at Lily Kaise.

Nissi Valdaire says, "Doesn't have to be me. Maybe shouldn't be. Melinda might

Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the south.

You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made
sapphire and blue star quilt on it.
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Is too exciting for me, the opik."
Kani says to Damien, "Will investigating things help?"
Damien Alexander says, "It looks like it's right in our way."
Lily Kaise waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys. "Allo."
Damien says to Kani, "Investigating how?"
l kani
Kani Kahakai
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has coppery skin. Her body is curvy with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She
has sloping shoulders and generous breasts. Her face is oval and girlish, with a
broad nose and round chin. Her lips are generous and applied with wet strawberry
lipstick, and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of
thin eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped, and enhanced with
sheer orchid eyeshadow. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is dark chocolate brown
and hanging in numerous braids. She has short painted frosted petal pink
fingernails. She has a sprinkling of tiny gold stars in her hair.
 She is wearing a cream satin tank top, a mosaic star bracelet, a pair of
stretchy black leggings with a multicolored star print, a chunky black leather
belt with a double row of round antique silver studs and a big star-shaped
buckle, and a pair of stompy black suede boots. She is also wearing a white
flightbag with a gold flower on the side, a sky blue wrist-mounted chronometer,
and some gleaming gold bangles. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders,
both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, right wrist, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying a can of strawberry milk in her right hand.
You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.
Melinda says to Kani, "Usually we don't stop for debris fields but, have at it."
'I think she means by investigating the point of interest.
You say, "I think she means by investigating the point of interest."
Damien shudders and brushes at his arm.
Melinda says to Kani, "If you want."
Kani Kahakai says, "I don't know how all those fancy science doo-dad buttons
work."
Lily Kaise grins.
Damien Alexander blinks. "Oh."
Damien says to Kani, "Sorry."
Nissi says to Damien, "Hey, sorry you've felt isolated. I know I had my part in
that, sorry for that too. It's the last thing you needed for the past year, took
me a while to figure that out."
Damien Alexander nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Melinda says to Damien, "I just wish I could have got you to believe me back
when Nicolette was doing all that spider buying business. I suppose it was too
fresh then and you just wanted to believe her."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Damien says to Melinda, "I remember you talkin' about Eve an' the spiders an'
somethin'..."
Melinda says to Damien, "Yeah, it caused one of our arguments."
Melinda Michaels chuckles.
Damien says to Melinda, "Probably cause Eve told me somethin' else an' I
believed her."
Melinda says to Damien, "I told her if she didn't stop playing with you and
Nicolette both, one or both of us was going to jail."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "If Anfisa was here, she would be unhappy
about the sorrying."
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Nissi Valdaire says, "She would."
Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys absently bobs his head up and down like a space
parakeet.
Lily Kaise says, "It just sucks and that's the nicest thing I can say."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Pretty much."
Damien says to Melinda, "It was about... yeah, somethin' about Eve leading
Nicolette on... what was it about the spiders? I gave credits ta Eve fer a
spider when she got it from Nicolette or something? I honestly can't remember
any more."
Damien Alexander says, "Man, that was so long ago."
Melinda says to Damien, "Yeah, Nicolette got her a spider or two. I don't
remember which. But she told you that she used your credits to get it."
'That was forever ago!
Damien Alexander nods to Melinda Michaels.
You exclaim, "That was forever ago!"
Melinda Michaels says, "Yup it was."
Damien Alexander says, "Not long after she allegedly started dating me."
Damien Alexander shakes his head.
Melinda says to Damien, "Anyway, I think you and Eli need to talk. If you want
somebody there, yeah I'd go with both Nissi and I or one of us. We've both
discussed this with him."
Damien Alexander nods to Melinda Michaels. "I think Eve should not be there."
Melinda Michaels says, "I agree."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah she'd do her twist magic."
Lily Kaise shrugs.
Melinda Michaels says, "I hear she convinced Corey to keep things secret. I hope
she hasn't done that again."
Damien Alexander says, "Suppose it'd gimme a bit of closure, anyhow."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah. My only worry is I don't know where Eli is at with
this now."
nod melinda 'She did.
You nod to Melinda Michaels. "She did."
Nissi Valdaire nods to Melinda Michaels.
Nissi Valdaire says, "At some point he decided he wasn't interested in the
truth."
Lily Kaise says, "And I know shule won't like for me to say this but she tried
it with Shule as well."
nod lily 'It's ok.
You nod to Lily Kaise. "It's ok."
'I wanted Damien to hear it from me in private.
You say, "I wanted Damien to hear it from me in private."
'First.
You say, "First."
Lily Kaise says, "The truth has to be known though and i'm proud of shule for
being faithful and so grateful."
'But now he knows.
You say, "But now he knows."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Not surprising. The names I could list off could fill this
ship. But again most of it is far from definite."
Lily Kaise nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Damien Alexander says, "All this secrecy... that just means I'm the one she's
been runnin' around on. She never asked me ta keep things private. But she has
asked me ta keep the PDA to a minimum, which I generally been okay with. Lately
it's started ta feel like she don't want anybody ta know we're dating... which
now makes a hell of a lotta sense."
shrug 'No idea why she tried it with me. 
You shrug. "No idea why she tried it with me."
A high-pitched whine fills your senses.
Kani Kahakai winces.
Damien squints at the high-pitched sound.
Damien Alexander says, "Hate that."
nod damien 'She didn't want any of her significant others to know who was dating
her.
You nod to Damien Alexander. "She didn't want any of her significant others to
know who was dating her."
Kani Kahakai says, "The rift disapproves of drama."
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh well I never trusted her for a moment!"
Kani rubs her temple discomfitedly.
Damien Alexander asks, "I don't want drama; I want truth. But it looks like I
been dating the drama machine, don't it?"
Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah."
Kani Kahakai smiles at Damien Alexander.
pat damien 
You pat Damien Alexander on the back.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I didn't trust her but I did think she'd ended the
juggling and settled on Eli. So when Damien came back and said what he did,
well..."
The curtains close, to no applause.
Elaine Moreau says, "People warned me of her and her 'secret partners' like my
second day after my license."
Kani says to Damien, "You'll figure it out. People seem to want to help you
figure it out."
Lily pats Damien on the back reassuringly.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off
on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky
from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains
of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first point
where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible.
The star itself is merely a distant glinting point, indistinguishable from any
of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort
cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar
flotsam.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced
with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and
the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air,
thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the
ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid
service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval
turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with
a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking

A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the

The engineering room of a starship should be a clean, sterile working
environment. This room, however, is filled with command consoles that have
cables visibly snaking across the floor, finding their way through ductwork to
reach deep within the bowels of the ship. The ship is portrayed on several data
displays, with stylised symbols representing specific ship components to aid in
damage level monitoring, system limitation and repair. A small, basic starmap
display is placed on a pivot on the ceiling, but it seems to be an afterthought
as any operator would have to turn around to face it when at a control board
attempting to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I see there have been some
instances of destroyed Battlesuits. Please take your time with missions and
check the damage to your Battlesuit, repair in between engaging the enemy. Also,
there is a box of Ground Combat-related books on the Liaison Office Conference
Room table. Please feel free to take those books to read. Please reach out to
any of us for questions concerning Ground Combat and how to manage your
Battlesuit or anything related. I will be away for a few days on a quick trip to
the Feng Wo Trading Collective. Fly safely! - Lily Kaise. [20:51  8 December
