00:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ehh. Not too interestin. The LTN knows who they all are."

00:39 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Eh, just something you don't see everyday without the actual name still being shown."

00:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Three of 'em are actually in comms with their comms turned off. Probably too much static where they are. The others are on a ship with no QE."

01:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."

01:27 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But."

01:27 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You know it'd be fun."

01:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Everybody's got one and they all stink."

01:28 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But science."

01:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's called a proctologist."

01:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or well, proctology I guess."

01:28 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I should probably ask what we're talking about now."

01:28 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think Erik wants to get high. For science."

01:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

01:28 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Might I recommend some of that grand haze sold on Merida?"

01:29 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What happens in Fringe space, stays in Fringe space?"

01:29 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Exactly!"

01:29 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fringe doesn't give a fuck. If I tell you some of the parties we use to have in Fringe space..."

01:29 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Now I suppose all the insane parties are in Mutuality space."

01:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Spacer rave."

01:30 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Since they seem to have looser restrictions with illegal substances."

01:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hey Ather, what's the deal with alcohol being illegal in AEU space, anyways?"

01:30 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which...aren't illegal in their space, so irrelevant!"

01:30 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's weird."

01:30 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause our trading centers do sell it."

01:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So wait, I can't give AEU pilots homebrew?"

01:30 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And everyone I know drinks it."

01:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is it just cause someone wants to have a monopoly on the production or something?"

01:30 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Probably."

01:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Could be."

01:31 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think Luxury clothing use to be illegal in EAOS space or something."

01:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The heck?"

01:31 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm likely wrong."

01:31 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Never traded in the stuff."

01:31 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That's strange."

01:32 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "There a list of banned substances somewhere?"

01:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not that I'm aware of."

01:32 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No clue if this one's up to date."

01:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait, you have one?"

01:32 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "There's one in the League SDC office."

01:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can't really rely on that list though."

01:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sure, but I don't particularly want to test it."

01:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What's banned in someone's space isnt' necessarily banned in someone else's space."

01:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No, it lists everyone's spaces separately."

01:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh trust me, most pilots by all indications, if they even do bother with trading or looking for illegal traders don't bother to scan ships."

01:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I still do, but it's an old habit."

01:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Note to self, scan all of Ather's ships, all the time."

01:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

01:34 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I do occasionally trade harvested organs, tis true."

01:34 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I wouldn't go posting all the trade spots in a book."

01:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Which are completely legal in League space."

01:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "These arn't trade spots though."

01:34 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh just what's legal and not."

01:34 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They're listing banned materials, not trade centers from the sounds of it, melinda."

01:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah."

01:35 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Good to know when you're smuggling, rather than doing it completely on accident."

01:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's my thought Elaine."

01:35 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yeah, I waqs sort of doing something else and missed part of the conversation."

01:35 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aha."

01:35 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Right, which people want a list."

01:35 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "I'd love one."

01:36 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I had to copy it across before I could photocopy it."

01:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I want one too."

01:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Me."

01:36 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alas, my trading center list is still somewhat incomplete, because I can't read the foxtrot, echo station and tandem station trading center lists."

01:36 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Time to work my way back one charge booster at a time."

01:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Where ya at Vern?"

01:37 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "I can go get the lists from those if you'll trade me the finished version."

01:37 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh a bit west of 777."

01:37 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Can't."

01:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

01:37 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Would, but can't."

01:37 Lily Kaise asks, "What a dumb fuck Vernos is after all this time of being a pilot he allows himself to run out of charge?"

01:37 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "A bit is a good bit if I shall admit."

01:38 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Meh, I hate letters."

01:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, if ya can't manage, lemme know. Will take me a bit to get out there."

01:38 Lily Kaise says, "I wouldn't dare ask for help with tht sort of lame mistake. Maybe of you but not openly heh."

01:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Melinda, Letters are a necessity to build words. How could you hate them?"

01:38 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels sighs.

01:39 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You should all, theoretically, have this list now. Bug me if you don't have a copy and want it."

01:39 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Thanks."

01:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks."

01:40 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow, that list is remarkably complete."

01:40 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Though, I think stun weapons are illegal somewhere too, can't remember though."

01:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I have no idea who wrote it, never seen the handwriting."

01:40 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Can I see the original?"

01:41 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sure."

01:41 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Still in the mail center."

01:41 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'd love a copy of that if you have time."

01:41 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "I guess someone could load up on stun guns and let themself be scanned in each alliance space."

01:41 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Done, Eli."

01:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's an idea."

01:41 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ah ha, I should have known. Reets!"

01:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

01:42 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, well then, I'm sure he'd have checked stun weapons too."

01:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Poor Fringe children."

01:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No entertainment holofilms."

01:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The heck?"

01:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm goin to pick up my copy. Now I'm just curious."

01:43 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "I didn't notice. We didn't have a holovid projector."

01:43 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thanks Erik."

01:45 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Who feels like being repeatedly arrested in by different alliances to check if this list is still up to date. Or, uh, better plan, is there someone official we could ask?"

01:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I will not be your guinea pig for this one."

01:45 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You have failed me Morris."

01:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "However, if you would like to do the bein arrested part, I'd be happy to oblige."

01:52 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "What's a good conversion percentage to go for when mining? I feel like I was low."

01:52 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "At first, you won't get one that's especially high cause it costs more to research and you get less back from buildings."

01:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eventually as close to 100 as you can get. But ya won't get there till ya got a good few upgrades under your belt."

01:52 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Keep your metals lost count below metals taken from wrecks."

01:52 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I seem to get about 95 percent."

01:53 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Ah. I was at ninety-one."

01:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mine is almost always 99 unless I'm doin a comet or radioactive."

01:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "91's great for an early mine."

01:53 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "My first few mines I never got higher than 83 or 84."

01:53 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Morris, you didn't do early mines. How do you know?"

01:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Been told."

01:53 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels chuckles.

01:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "By quite a few folks actually."

01:54 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Might make it back to 777 on two boosters."

01:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And yes. I was an idiot and didn't mine till I had more'n half the upgrades."

01:54 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:54 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I love Metal ones as I get 100 percent on those often."

01:54 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "To be fair, it took three hours to earn what I got in like thirty minutes of hauling. But it was fun."

01:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't. I ahem...can't be bothered to sit through not upgradin 'em to where I end up with 97 or so."

01:55 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I feel like I say this a lot."

01:55 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That last bit of mining is very tollarolerable with a good book."

01:56 [General Communication] "Yep." Morris Corlew chuckles. "For me, the first hour of work is the active stuff, then sit back with a book or a good conversation on comms for a couple hours."

01:56 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "I get impatient and add upgrades here and there through the second hour, but yeah."

01:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I did that on some of my mines. Just to play with stuff."

01:57 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Nothing is illegal in Mutuality space?"

01:57 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Apparently."

01:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:58 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm experiencing a deleilemma. I could buy a bunch of mining upgrades now, or wait till I have the credits for a total site metals upgrade."

01:58 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey morris?"

01:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yo."

01:59 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Buy the other upgrades first, Erik. They'll help."

01:59 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "When I get back to 777 I might need help getting back to the standard beacon network."

01:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a charger there."

02:00 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Must have missed it."

02:00 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I really did not go that far out."

02:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm pretty sure there's a charge station. The watchtower."

02:00 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Next time need to check my charge first."

02:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

02:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How much further ya got to go?"

02:18 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "About 20 sectors."

02:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah ok."

02:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "One booster should for sure be enough."

02:18 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Already used one before."

02:19 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "But this is part of why boosters exist I suppose."

02:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

03:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's kinda weird. They seem to see one in the container they can't handle and don't wanna mess with the rest."

03:27 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "They took some last night. Thought they didn't take the rest due to earning too many points too fast."

17:02 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Says I'm not qualified to purchase any modules in that category."

17:06 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I got looking at that and completely forgot why I even came over here..."

17:06 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Getting hit disrupts microdrones, right? So no using it in solo combat."

17:07 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You can use it."

17:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can. But yes, you may get interrupted if you get hit."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

21:18     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)
