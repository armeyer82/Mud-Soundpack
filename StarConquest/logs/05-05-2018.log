00:10 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chirps quietly as it receives a new notice.

00:14 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a small dusky pink trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, a glossy 
00:14 ruby red ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and gold aquatic life and coral rocks, and a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.
You can go south and out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:25 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:26 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:26 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

03:26 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:26 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

03:26 You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:26 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:29 The ship is already moving.

03:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:30 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 837" has jumped into the sector.

03:30 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 837! Welcome to home space!"

03:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:30 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:30 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:32 You see nothing special.
It is open.
It is empty.

03:32 You ask, "Did you already watch the videos?"

03:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
