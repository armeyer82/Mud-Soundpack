00:29 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Is there a coordinates command on asteroid sites?"

00:29 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just look."

00:29 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It'll tell you your coordinates in the room title."

00:29 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can see where your buildings are with buildings, where each drone is with drones, or if you're on your site, what he said."

00:31 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "I have 100 metal units, a drone factory requires 100 metal units, why can't I build it?"

00:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Power maybe?"

00:31 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do you have enough power? Are the metals at your coordinator?"

00:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, you can't build within 2 units of any other building."

00:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "But...it should actually tell you why you can't build it."

00:32 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Last yes, the first, well, the system should tell that instead of saying not enough metals I think."

00:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did you check metals or status?"

00:32 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, your metals have to be at your coordinator to use them."

00:32 [Newbie Help] Johann Schraft transmits, "Sounds like the drones haven't transported all your metals to the coordinator yet."

00:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Metals includes metals that haven't been moved to the coordinator. You need to check status."

00:32 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Metals."

00:33 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Summary tells you more about that is mined but not processed etc too."

00:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't use metals for knowing how many you have available to use. Use stat for that."

00:41 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's not something someone can tell you icly. Talk to strangers."

00:41 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, can we not tell them to ask around for odd jobs IC?"

00:41 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've never heard that one."

00:43 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "That seems a little out of place, something that's theoretically so important is obtained by some process that isn't in character."

00:43 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's in-character, it's not something we can talk about though."

00:43 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok."

00:43 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Try the help quests help file. That will explains it."

00:43 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Explain it too."

00:43 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We cannot disclose information about quests in the game. It's just one of those things we don't do. We just say "look around" or something equlaly vague. Disclosing quest information ruins parts of the game, honestly."

00:45 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Which is why we often tell people who are new, talk to strangers, or ask them if they have."

00:47 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Meet at old earth when you're ready to go on beacons with me to try out these new ships."

00:47 [Tactical Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Good timing. I've just finished my experiment."

01:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:10 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I'm pleased to see a lot of Low Deployment Missions occurring. In order to prevent battlesuit destructions, please be certain to repair between encounters with the enemy and to check your damage while in battle. If your damage is increasing beyond 50 percent, then Launch out and get repairs. You can still reenter the mission and complete it. Attention Cadets, there are a number of boxes of books and other useful items on the conference table in the Liaison office Conference Room. When you enter the Office Building, go up the corridor and you will see the door straight away. Feel free to borrow the books or keep them if they are books which you will refer to. As for other items, feel free to keep those as needed. Please feel free to read the book, "The Layman's Guide To Genetic Experimentation" but leave this book on the table after you have read it. We will gather prior to midnight this evening to engage in back to back bari cleansing of the Old Frontier Asteroid Mining station in Frontier Cluster. Anyone is welcome! [19:33 28 October 2317 GST]

02:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Daisy May, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But.. I kinda got whatever, really. I even have an empty slot."

02:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:38 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Whatcha want me to wear Ather!"

02:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:38 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"

02:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm. I wonder why my battlesuit is on old earth."

02:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:38 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Domination" has launched from New Earth.

02:38 A hefty fuligin soldier felo seems to be hungry.

02:38 A hefty fuligin soldier felo approaches a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

02:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:39 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Daisy May. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:39 You're already standing.

02:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

02:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:39 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

02:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

02:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What suits are you and shule bringing?"

02:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "EAOS 4."

02:41 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Domination" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We were asking you what you wanted?"

02:41 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

02:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, if he brings EAOS 4, you bring AEu, and I'll tank."

02:51 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:51 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

02:51 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:52 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

02:52 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You can go west.

14:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:22 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

14:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:22 The ship is already moving.

14:22 The ship is already moving.

14:22 The ship is already moving.

14:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:22 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

14:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:22 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

14:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:22 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:23 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

14:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

14:23 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:23 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

14:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:23 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:23 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:23 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

You can go up and out.

15:24 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:24 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:24 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

15:24 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On my way."

15:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:25 [Tactical Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "Ok."

15:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:25 The ship is already moving.

15:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

15:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:25 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

15:25 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:25 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Fearless! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

15:25 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

15:25 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

15:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:26 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

15:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:26 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:26  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case.

15:27 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "In the lounge."

15:27 You peer out...

15:27 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.

15:27 [Tactical Communication] Mike Marshall transmits, "Ok be there shortly."

15:27 You peer into back stairway to the garage...

15:27 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Garage]
Starships of various sizes and shapes are parked here. The area is large, able to accommodate hundreds of starships, and the ceiling is high, interlaced with the high-pressure pipes and mechanisms of the massive hydraulic system that moves ships between the garage and the landing pad above. Though the hydraulics are noisy and echo loudly through the area when activated, you can still hear the footsteps of pilots and travelers as they make their way along the wide metal stairway leading up to the landing pad and down to lower levels of the subterranean spaceport. A well-lit stairway here provides easy access to the pilot lounge.
You can go up and down.

15:28 You peer out...

15:32 A pilot walks in, orders a drink, and goes to sit in a dark corner alone.

15:37 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

15:39 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

15:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Ok, stupid question, where actually is chit. I thought I new, and aparrently I don't."

15:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Chetumal orbit I think."

15:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just jump to Chetumal."

15:42 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the one-person cargo hauler "Golden Dawn" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

15:42 Cadet Katie Celayla just arrived.

15:42 Cadet Katie Celayla smiles at you.

15:42 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Tamra and mike will be here shortly."

15:42 You smile at Cadet Katie Celayla.

15:43 You ask, "Who's Mule are we using?"

15:43 Katie paces a little looking frustrated, "sometimes, I think I can warm to the league, other times, they drive me absolutely insane. Never running on time,always relying n others, never..." she pauses in her rant and looks up, "yours" she says, before ranting on, " tamra's isn't upgraded, typical league, again." she sighs heavily, and whirls to face shule. "sorry." she says, "one of them days."

15:44 You say, "Awww, it's ok."

15:44 You ask, "Weit, we're using my Mule?"

15:44 You say, "I need to go get it."

15:44 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Okey doke."

15:44 You say, "Be right back."

15:45 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:45 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:48 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]

15:48 Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

15:50 Katie hesitates, and then hugs back, looking dwarfed by shules 6 2 to her 5 2.

15:50 [Newbie Help] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah, so you have to exchange those bucks for points then?"

15:50 You smile at Cadet Katie Celayla.

15:50 Cadet Katie Celayla exclaims, "I feel so small!"

15:50 You say to Katie, "I don't bite... often."

15:51 Cadet Katie Celayla smirks.

15:51 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "You have tesla points which you get by completing missions."

15:51 [Newbie Help] Jade Burkley transmits, "I guess you check the point summary for them?"

15:51 [Newbie Help] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh never mind, points works."

15:51 Cadet Katie Celayla exclaims, "Just not used to being hugged by tall people! I felt alright on my home world, everyone was short, like me! I come out into the world of piloting and you're all huge!"

15:51 Cadet Katie Celayla giggles.

15:52 You laugh.

15:59 Katie says to you, "Is he trying to be funny, or is he really looking to get his nose broken that much."

15:59 Mike Marshall asks, "Who?"

15:59 A pilot mutters threats and imprecations into his comm, then glances around nervously as if realizing he might have been overheard.

15:59 You say to Katie, "Maybe a bit of both?"

17:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:43 [Starship "Lidia's Pride"; Control Room]

17:43 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
