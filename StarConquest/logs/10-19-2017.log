00:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I think I would only want this in the even that neither side will agree to a real non-aggression pact."

00:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In the event, sorry."

00:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone coughs.

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My thinking is that the full non-aggression pact will tick all the boxes. It gets us the tech we want, gives them more than the low-level tech they were getting in the old skim agreement, and includes a promise of no hostility. If our government won't make such a promise, striking a lesser deal with them could be dangerous and blow up in our faces. If our navy were to use the skim to do something over there, we'd never live it down."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Tier 1, rental."

00:40 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Anyone up for beacons?"

01:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They basically provide small boosts to certain systems."

01:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Very much worth getting?"

01:15 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the one-person bastille "Temporary Name Aleph".

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, won't matter so much at early point levels, honestly."

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine, to answer your question much belatedly: a non-aggression pact will always be on the table. I have glorious game plan!"

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "My plan will most likely fail, but eh, such is life."

01:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey.. eli.. where are you?"

01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm around, why wha'ts up?"

01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The determination of the proposal is in less than a half hour, that's what's up! Be excited and eager!"

01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I seen another glowing vial... of blue stuff. Interesting stuff."

01:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh that. Yeah, don't drink it."

01:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It made Eli into what he is today, it made another guy into something frekay as fuck, it made a chick go into a cocoon and turn into a total freakshow with tentacles."

01:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The EAOS are doing a lot of shit with genetic manipulation. Or at least, they were."

01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sheesh... that's crazy ather."

01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "When you've been a pilot for this long, and seen some of the shit we've seen, you'd wonder how I'm still actually technically still on the side of sane."

01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it can do a lot of freaky stuff to people, and each vial isn't even necessarily the same stuff as the last."

01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not. Basic experimentation determined that much."

01:48 There appear to be about 12 pilots recently active.

01:51 You say to Lily, "Hi my love."

01:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "With only about ten or so minutes remaining, I encourage anyone who wants to be here for the determination of the results promptly at midnight to get their butts over to the conference room in the liaison office without delay! We will not wait."

01:51 "Hi there Handsome!" Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

01:55 You grin.

01:58 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:59 Johnathon Triggs glances down at his wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

01:59 Ather approaches the AEU civilian pilot corps voting machine and glances at the screen, then at his Chrono.

01:59 Johnathon rols a drum roll on the edge of the table.

02:00 I see no "chronmeter" here.

02:00 a gold wrist-mounted chronometer

02:00 It covers nothing.

In addition to a Mutuallly-agreed upon guarantee from both sides of no hostilities?...
Option yes received 4 votes, or 66.67% of the vote.
Option no received 2 votes, or 33.33% of the vote.
The winning option is... yes!

02:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I'm nervous!"

02:00 Johnathon Triggs grins.

02:00 You say, "Oh, good. It passed."

02:01 Ather Jammoa nods.

02:01 Shule sighs in relief.

02:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers.

02:01 Johnathon Triggs says, "So... I wonder who it was that voted no. Time to strand them on Grenwald."

02:01 Johnathon Triggs grins.

02:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah some tried to be obstructionsts but yes this is something we all had our own choice to exercise."

02:02 Ather says to Johnathon, "Na."

02:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So sure glae it passed."

02:02 Johnathon Triggs grins at Ather Jammoa.

02:02 I don't see that here.

02:02 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:02 Ather says to Johnathon, "We have to let democracy take its course. As Lily said, some are entitled to their opinions. Some were probably misinformed regarding what was going on, too."

02:02 You say, "Very true."

02:03 Johnathon Triggs nods to Ather Jammoa.

02:03 Ather Jammoa says, "I'm pretty sure Constantine was one of the folks who voted no, but he also did not appear to understand the vote."

02:03 Johnathon says to Ather, "Oh, I know. I'm just teasing. I'd never allow such a thing to happen."

02:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Exactly which I found troubling and there's no reasoning with him at times."

02:03 Johnathon Triggs says, "Actually, I think he voted yes."

02:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wellhe was pretty dead against it."

02:04 You say, "Well, we may never know who voted no then."

02:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:04 Johnathon Triggs says, "Though, I know he was torn between yes and no."

02:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Eli was more on the fence. Constantine kept saying why do we care about the Skims."

02:05 Johnathon says to Lily, "No... he was concerned with how things played out."

02:05 Johnathon Triggs says, "Over all."

02:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "His lack of experience was obviously the issue but he just doesn't listen sometimes but at least htis prevailed. It's not what I truly wanted to do but we need to get access back to the skims and it's not just for materialistic reasons."

02:05 Johnathon Triggs says, "Weather they'd agree with an NAP.. or what. But.. there are also a lot of varibles. One, our current administration."

02:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:06 Ather says to Johnathon, "I'd be surprised if Constantine voted yes."

02:07 Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:

02:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyone interested in decoy beacon drops? Looking for 1-4 more folks."

02:07 Ather Jammoa says, "You guys go ahead to the lounge if you want to go, I'll be there shortly. I want to send a quick comm notice."

02:07 Johnathon Triggs says, "If he did vote yes, and this didn't go well with our plans. At least we tried."

02:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Beacon drops I mean."

02:09 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:09 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:09 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: As all of you might know by now if you read your message boards, the proposal did pass, with a 66% vote for "yes".

02:13 Johnathon Triggs says, "Ah."

02:13 Ather Jammoa says, "The annexing ship."

02:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Mind if I engineer or is someone sle going to?"

02:13 Johnathon Triggs grins.

02:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Else that is."

02:14 Ather says to Lily, "That's fine."

02:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Ok thanks!"

02:14 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:14 You ask, "Can I just stand in the weapon room and look pretty?"

02:14 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the vostok-class capsule "Names Are So Overrated" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:15 Michael Kennedy waves.

02:15 You follow Ather Jammoa into back stairway to the garage.

02:15 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
Ather Jammoa, Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, and Johnathon Triggs are standing here.
You can go up.

02:15 You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair here.
You can go down.

02:15 Johnathon Triggs's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Room two."

02:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:15 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "In 4."

02:15 [Starship "Annexation"; Weapons Room Four]

02:15 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair here.
You can go down.

02:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:15 Eli Grey wanders in from below.

02:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Daucttape control!"

02:15 Eli Grey wanders down.

02:15 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:15 You sit down on a swiveling black leather gunner's chair.

02:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Duct tape that is."

02:16 I don't understand that.

02:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:16 The starship transitions into another sector.

02:16 Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Weapons room 3, standing by."

02:16 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I feel so alone, the only person not from AEU here."

02:16 The starship transitions into another sector.

02:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:17 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Stand by for beacon deployment."

02:17 There are no other ships in the sector.

02:17 Johnathon Triggs's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Standing by."

02:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:18 You peer down...

02:18 
[Starship "Annexation"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive and a large leather chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

02:20 Johnathon Triggs's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he chuckles.

02:20 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why do people keep saying "roger" instead of understood?"

02:20 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It is all confusing."

02:21 Star Conquest Help: Renaming Starships
--
Category: Game Systems
--
You may rename your starship at any branch of the Starship Registry, found at all capital spaceport facilities. Renaming will charge you a fee depending on the class and base value of the starship.

To rename your ship, have it on the nearest landing pad and use the RENAME command inside a starship registry.

Renaming a ship will automatically post a public message to the message boards, so that you cannot, for instance, commit an act of piracy and then make your ship untraceable by changing its name.

If you are looking for help on renaming your character, please read the Name Change help file.
