Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean

 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect
solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver
wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and a neon purple wrist-mounted

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[Residential Structure; ITPN Station; Main Circuit]
Like the docking bay to the south, this ITPN station appears to be wholly open
to space, an illusion enabled by the use of a huge single piece of curved
transparent plasteel. A metal viewing rail runs around the exterior of the
semicircular space. At its center, the pod platform is positioned directly below
a broad hole in the ceiling that leads up into open space. Pods arrive and
depart through the hole with clockwork precision. Passengers disembark and load
from a designated area at the top of some stone steps. Large displays hang from
the ceiling and provide status updates.

I'm sorry if you thought my actions were out of line, but I was simply done

asset of ours into the fray?"
tr org I thought you trusted me more than that to have a good reason and a
strategy.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I thought you
trusted me more than that to have a good reason and a strategy."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Last morning I sensed
you would prefer threesomes and other things over me in the first place."
tr org That's not fair. I told you I was open to the idea, not that I preferred
them.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's not fair. I
told you I was open to the idea, not that I preferred them."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I won't kick you out
just now but you will have to come to me first and I know you won't because the
wild side is calling you my love."
tr org And you know what? I've played the wild side, I've been hurt from the

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And you know what?
I've played the wild side, I've been hurt from the wild side. I wanted you

but launch."
tr org And I didn't run out of the ship because I was angry. I ran out of the

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And I didn't run
out of the ship because I was angry. I ran out of the ship to check the terminal
because things were happening really fast."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Faithfulness but no

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh so if we jumped in
with that little ship and got blown to bits in a couple of hits how would that
help our navy don't blame me for being responsible."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Why is it that I feel
every few months, you want to test the waters so that you can find an easy out
of our relationship? So now you have your out Shule."
tr org The Merry band ships had their hands full with the navy ast it was. I
just wanted to provide support. They didn't even try to engage me.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The Merry band
ships had their hands full with the navy ast it was. I just wanted to provide
support. They didn't even try to engage me."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So why something as
helpless as a nearly cadelt-level bolt thrower?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "For gotds sakes you
could have just gone in with a fighter."
tr org Because I could at least launch bolts and make it easier for the navy to
fight them.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Because I could at
least launch bolts and make it easier for the navy to fight them."
tr org No, a fighter can't launch bolts.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No, a fighter
can't launch bolts."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Anyone heard when the alko
holics are to be home?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well well I'm not
convinced but now that you have your own, I am fine to test thattheory but I
jsut believed that to be irresponsible."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "The water that is."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Sorry it should be alkohaulics
I suppose."
tr org I know what kind of problems bolts can cause. I've had to fly against it
before, but in the end, it didn't matter this time.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I know what kind
of problems bolts can cause. I've had to fly against it before, but in the end,
it didn't matter this time."
tr org But it's fine. I'll just use my own next time. I have no problem with
that.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But it's fine.
I'll just use my own next time. I have no problem with that."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "The bolt thrower can
only take 202 hit so as I say I'm not over-confident I'm sorry if I have
sentamental regard for Flash. I'd rather see a stronger ship go in. Even our
clipper or the escort."
tr org I understand that and I'm sorry. I didn't realize there was sentimental
value there. I was only thinking that if our clipper or escorts got popped, we'd
lose more than just the basic upgrades. Mine has a lot of crafted items on it
and with our lack of access to GMG, I didn't want to take that chance.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I understand that

don't think has anyhting from Farport on it."
tr org Oh, I wasn't sure. I know mine does.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, I wasn't sure.
I know mine does."

to do good things for others. I am truly dedicated to helping others grow and to
excel and when somebody like Ather who is eaten up with jealousy and bitterness

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a black
plastic tray of spider chow, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

[Starship "Thunder And Lightning"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Starship "Albatross"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
