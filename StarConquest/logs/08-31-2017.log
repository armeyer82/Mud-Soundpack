Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result
00:14:24  in controversy.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.

01:32:05 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:32:05 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:32:06 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:32:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:32:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:32:13 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:32:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:33:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:54:46 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:54:46 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, a robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

01:54:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:54:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

01:54:53 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

01:54:54 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:54:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:54:56 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:55:02 You say to Lily, "Hi love!"

01:55:24 You cheer.

01:55:26 You grin.

01:55:27 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:55:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I'm so glad he put those up."

01:55:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:55:42 You say, "Me too."

01:55:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:55:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:55:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Oh should we go back to the torus?"

01:55:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:55:53 You say, "Sure."

01:55:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Hoover". The organization has earned 1,848,747.83 credits.

01:55:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:56:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:56:01 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:56:02 You say, "That's fine."

01:56:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:56:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:56:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:56:07 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:56:08 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:56:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:56:09 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

01:56:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:56:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:56:12 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:56:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah wow that must have really got your blood flowing heh."

01:56:15 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:56:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:56:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:56:18 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

01:56:19 You say, "Yeah, it did."

01:56:21 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:56:43 You say, "There was a notice that kept flashing in red on my terminal when it was under siege."

01:56:52 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:56:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

01:56:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:56:59 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:57:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:57:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:57:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:57:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

01:57:16 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:57:19 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:57:28 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, hmm. I guess I should've figured contributing to industrial stations would count."

01:57:32 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK, invaders is out too!"

01:57:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So for the time-being until Kim communicates with us, we're not to use any of Starseekers parts on income producing stations."

01:57:59 You nod.

01:58:01 You say, "Right."

01:58:14 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay. I will try to catch Erik before he puts the out of comm roid station up."

01:58:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:58:58 You're already sitting.

01:59:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:59:03 I don't understand that.

01:59:06 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:59:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "She loaded Breeders and a couple of Panels onto Starseekers Spare Parts and of course used our Megacredits. That was a bit annoying but I wrote to Melinda and Melinda says she won't use any of those parts until kim says something."

01:59:33 You nod. "Ok."

02:00:22 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins works his fangs.

02:02:15 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

02:02:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:04:17 I don't see that here.

02:04:25 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I love you."

02:04:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

02:04:39 Lily says to you, "I love you too!"

02:05:54 You say, "Nope."

02:05:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Aww."

02:06:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Whose ship?"

02:06:13 You say, "I know. I was hoping I would. It was Ali's."

02:06:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:07:17 You say, "We only managed to pop one poseidon. The Accord took care of the rest."

02:07:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow."

02:07:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Which is one reason we need them on our side."

02:07:41 You say, "I know."

02:08:02 You say, "I'm going to write up a more detailed report for Constantine and to put in the SDC office."

02:08:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

02:08:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

02:08:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers.

02:08:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yay his report did get to the media and they reported it accurately or it seems to have been reported so."

02:09:26 You say, "Well, people interpreted it as the media saying we were kind of pressured into voting in favor of it. Which is totally hog wash."

02:09:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow that's a lie."

02:09:46 You say, "I know."

02:09:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think I mentioned voting one time but I never said how."

02:10:25 You nod. "They're saying that's what lodaded wording meant."

02:10:29 You say, "Loaded."

02:10:34 You say, "Bleh, I can't talk."

02:10:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is just so stupid though how would anybody think that any of us are for outccord."

02:10:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:11:02 You say, "Exactly."

02:11:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:11:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh forgot I had her haha."

02:11:32 You say, "And of course, Morris had to throw his tw credits worth of know-it-all arrogance."

02:11:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident frowns.

02:11:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah he is always like 90 degrees shifted wrong too."

02:12:05 You say, "I know."

02:12:33 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Laters Tobias and Morris."

02:12:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

02:12:52 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

02:12:59 You say, "He said that we should have just kept it simple. Not realizing that we had already had voted on something very similar before."

02:13:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just like when I was trying to discuss the stations with Melinda, he had to put his two-cents worth in and he just so doesn't realize that anything he says is of no imortance because he is no longer a member of Starseekers."

02:13:09 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Later."

02:13:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Same goes for erik who didn't even know what the issue was."

02:13:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yet he tried to talk down to me."

02:13:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:13:48 You say, "Yeah, and he was complaining about being the middle man. Next time he says something about that, I'm just going to tell him there's a simple solution. He should just shut up and stay outof it. Then he wouldn't be themiddle man."

02:14:02 You say, "Out of it that is."

02:14:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That's when I finally said I'm discussing this with Melinda and I'll work through Melinda only."

02:14:16 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:14:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hahahhaha."

02:14:55 Lily says to you, "Thank you!"

02:14:55 You say, "If he doesn't want to be the middle man. Then he should get involved and become the middle man."

02:15:03 You say, "Shouldn't."

02:15:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Precisely."

02:15:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think he's missing being a controler and well he just can't have it both ways."

02:15:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Now he is nobody."

02:15:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:15:40 You laugh.

02:16:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He is going to have to work his ass off like I did to get his organization to anything and you know how much work I did."

02:16:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then you came in and you helped tremendously."

02:16:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

02:16:48 You say, "Yeah and he'll just whine and bitch at everyone the whole way and tell everyone how to run their organizations."

02:16:56 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:16:58 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:17:12 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:17:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:18:02 You say, "If it weren't for the NAP and such, I'd be so tempted to hang him up by his toenails from the landing struts of my ship and dump him in space somwhere far away form home."

02:18:09 You say, "From home."

02:18:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh i'm sure it wouldn't be just us who would."

02:18:27 You grin.

02:18:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He is not very-well liked."

02:19:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Melinda did not have any kind words to say about him especially in regard to how he treated Sarah."

02:19:10 You ask, "Oh really?"

02:19:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Right."

02:19:17 You ask, "Like what did she say?"

02:19:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well we both agreed that we'd have kicked him to the curb."

02:19:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:19:37 You laugh.

02:19:58 You say, "Oh I want to be there so I can shove my boot up his... ahem."

02:20:14 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

02:20:18 You say, "Well, I would have liked to be there."

02:20:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well that's the kind of conversation which doesn't take long and one doesn't have to say much!"

02:20:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:20:53 You laugh.

02:20:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:21:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Right Asteria precisely!"

02:21:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:21:10 You grin.

02:21:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:21:29 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Hello."

02:21:35 You say, "He just irratates me now with every word that comes out of his arragant mouth."

02:21:45 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo Alko."

02:21:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh yeah I can't stand to hear his whiney voice."

02:22:06 Shule nods emphatically.

02:22:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That drawl just sends me into total disgust."

02:22:25 You nod.

02:23:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:23:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:24:03 You say, "Ok, I'm done venting for noww. I just had to get that out of my system."

02:24:08 You say, "For now."

02:24:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok Love."

02:24:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:24:21 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:24:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You are generally more laid-back. I'm the one who gets totally pissed."

02:24:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:24:59 You laugh.

02:25:05 You say, "Not in this case."

02:25:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well, like Cesar, he got his in the end and not exactly how we all thoght it would happen."

02:25:56 You nod.

02:26:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well all those of us who didn't kiss his ass."

02:26:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:35:05 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can't get rentals? Oh never mind."

02:35:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If somebody took him through the skim maybe...but they can't get upgrades even if somebody takes 'em through, so I'm thinkin quite possibly not."

02:35:33 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, it's across the skim. Perhaps if he was in someone elses ship, they might sell it to him. But I know that our ships are not allowed to get upgrades over there right now."

02:35:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well I don't care much for him but before I got along with him I wonder what happened?"

02:35:43 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, it'd be an interesting thing to test. Agnar might still be selling to AEU folks. It depends on if Tannhauser is still renting out ships."

02:35:44 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Right makes sense."

02:35:57 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have 13 mill AEU credits. So I can probably buy one. What kinds of modules would you folks recommend?"

02:36:02 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I figured they'd deal with anyone but yeah the skim would be an issue."

02:36:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Laser and Minidrones."

02:36:14 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:36:29 You say, "Oh, I don't know. I just know that Tara was pretty mad at Erik the other day. And Jacob is asking about battlesuits."

02:36:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

02:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Jacob, Lily is our GSL. You're welcome to ask her about battlesuits too."

02:37:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I tuned the AEU channel down."

02:37:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "GSL?"

02:37:22 You say, "Nah, he asked over General."

02:37:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

02:37:39 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm honestly surprised that they're refusing to sell things. I mean, far as I know, only skim access was denied to AEU pilots. No AEU pilot I know of recently has violated the freeport doctrine."

02:37:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ground squad leader. She's the person in charge of ground combat."

02:37:47 I don't understand that.

02:37:52 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So they are?"

02:38:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah, I gotcha. Yeah if I see her around i'll give her a shout."

02:38:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They just won't let us get upgrades on our ships, because our ships really shouldn't be over there anyways. At least that's the theory."

02:38:15 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "The agreement included technology trade."

02:38:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Jacob, if ya wanna try for Helios, convert some currency to Mutuality. I'll take ya over and we'll see."

02:38:32 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They charge in your own currency for suits."

02:38:34 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, they're apparently definitely refusing to sell ship upgrades, and those upgrades are exploration ones. It's not like they're military in any way. If they were, I'd understand."

02:38:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh do they?"

02:38:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:38:58 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, who knew."

02:39:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, I pay in Fringe for suit things wherever I get them, including Helios."

02:39:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, Jacob, if ya wanna try, come over to Old Earth if ya hadn't bought it yet."

02:39:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wish I could just give those out but they are more expensive than the amount of credits we're able to give."

02:39:37 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm gonna pay tara back for the cannon she got me earlier today, and then I'll get the suit."

02:39:38 You say, "I know."

02:39:40 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Skim agreement included technology trade. We had access to some AEU components at our stores we no longer get."

02:39:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think books should be an exception."

02:39:51 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "They were far inferior to what we were offering you."

02:39:56 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Surprise."

02:40:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think that should still leave ya enough Jacob."

02:40:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

02:40:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on your lap.

02:40:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It won't be that expensive."

02:41:38 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is it true that fringe tier five suit ammunition costs 5 mill?"

02:41:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah but if he wants to do Tesla, you need 20 il to register."

02:41:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Mil."

02:41:49 You nod.

02:41:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

02:42:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Even League ammo in a tier 5 can be expensive."

02:42:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "As many rounds as it holds."

02:42:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well, I won't miss running out of ammo at GMG."

12:03:17 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a pocket-sized purple holovid here.

12:04:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

12:04:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:04:32 The computer reports that the one-person courier "Vortex Industries 231" has jumped into the sector.

12:04:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:04:35 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Vortex Industries 231. Welcome to The Torus."

12:04:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:04:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:04:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

12:04:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:04:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:04:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:04:44 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:36:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:36:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:36:04 I don't understand that.

12:36:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:36:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:36:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

12:36:11 You can go out and enter into the ship.

12:36:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I've just ftl'd to both of those sectors. Notta. Unless they're outside the sectors themselves?"

12:36:13 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

12:36:13 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

12:36:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:36:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:36:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:36:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:36:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:36:43 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 201,416.92 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

12:36:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Try C-12."

12:36:51 The ship is already moving.

12:36:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:36:54 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Dusty Reaches. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:36:54 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:36:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

12:36:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or Belt of Orion."

12:37:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:37:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:37:02 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

12:37:04 Starships In Sector:

14:32:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee with a large neon purple dragon appliqued on the front, a pair of body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle blue and coral pink jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold r
14:32:12 ing inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, waist, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

14:32:28 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

14:32:37 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

14:32:44 You say to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, "Hi beautiful."

14:35:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

16:20:25 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a robotic chef named Nellie, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

19:32:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

19:32:20 You scramble to your feet.

19:32:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]
You see a swiveling dark green leather gunner's chair and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go west.

19:32:21 You turn general communication off.

19:32:23 You turn general communication on.

19:32:25 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:32:25 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a robotic chef named Nellie, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a dark green leather captain's chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

19:32:27 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

19:32:28 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

19:33:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Heya there."

19:34:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heya."

19:36:34 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Everyone quiet!"

19:36:50 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No, you talked. Therefore untrue statement."

19:36:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "One of them days. Now don't wake my felo. Hadesa's takin good advantage of the quiet."

19:37:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Remind me not to try to do a solo ground combat mission unless I feel really comfortable with things. I already almost blew up twice today. Once when I was going through the outsider mission on new earth and once when trying to get through destroying a rats pod. Ouch. I had to launch out of both of them and get repairs for my battlesuit."

19:37:14 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Ok, everyone, besides myself."

19:37:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll have to complete that rats mission some time today though. Gotta."

19:37:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh whoa... there's other people in the galaxy?"

19:37:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."

19:37:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What suit are you in?"

19:37:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's up other people!"

19:37:46 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I'd like to hope so."

19:37:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Gotta say it I'm a little nervous."

19:37:57 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Not much."

19:38:04 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Bored out of my mind, so just doing a few tesla."

19:38:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have one of the r."

19:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "The rentals I mean. Stupid comm."

19:38:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what bores me outta my mind."

19:38:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And do you have a minidrones module on it?"

19:38:43 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Salvaging does for me."

19:38:55 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "There are no people till coffee is consumed. Therefore I shall now be quiet again and consume it."

19:39:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yep. My downfall was that I used all the drones too quickly."

19:39:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's no shame in having to launch like that. It'll get easier once you start getting more upgrades."

19:39:19 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "You heard it from her, a cup of coffee is more important than we are."

19:39:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, launching is way better than letting a giant space robot break both your legs."

19:39:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I've done more than once."

19:39:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have to think when I salvage. Tesla is better with enemies, but...before I got enemies, it was like washin my hair. Rinse, lather, repeat. Scan, extract repeat."

19:39:48 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I"m generally looking for big stones, hauling them up til they scream, then dropping them."

19:39:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh wait. Lather, rinse, repeat."

19:40:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know. I'd just like to be able to complete it in one go though."

19:40:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I'm not talking about one-use repair drones, I'm talking about the minidrones module that lets you use the repair ability."

19:40:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they're two different things."

19:40:28 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Yeah, it's a bit dull without enemies, but what can one do!"

19:40:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or whatever it's called in that suit, maybe minor restoration?"

19:40:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eve, lemme know when you've had your coffee and you can think straight please."

19:40:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "The microdrones?"

19:40:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:40:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also, you can repair your suit if you have the Minidrones Module. Be certin to use the Abilities you have as there is at least a Minor type of Repair Ability even at this level."

19:41:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Salvage, Michael. Roid haul, lots of other things. But...some folks are fine with it...I just can't do it."

19:41:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The minidrones won't run out, they just use energy, which will replenish with a little time."

19:41:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:41:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You don't need to rely just upon Repair Drones."

19:41:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Even the basic repair ability should make those missions a snap in the rental."

19:41:42 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can do that, Morris."

19:41:42 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yeah, I can't wait to get enemies to deal with with tesla but I don't mind repetition if I have a good book or something on holo or someone to talk to."

19:41:43 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

19:41:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:41:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

19:41:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You can see what you have equipped at the battlesuit outfitter."

19:41:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I don't think I have the mini drones module. Just the micro drones. And you only get 5 of those."

19:42:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kinda hard to read a book or watch the holovid while doin solo Tesla."

19:42:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, when you get a chance, head over to the battlesuit outfitter and put a minidrones module on."

19:42:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "To a point yeah."

19:42:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Then buy the minor restoration ability."

19:42:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll be wrecking enforcer drones in no time."

19:42:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's where the someone fun to talk to comes in."

19:42:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have the restoration already. But I can only have two modules on the rental."

19:43:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You want guns and minidrones."

19:43:08 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Telex here, AEU scout launching."

19:43:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "For solo work."

19:43:10 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in Telex, AEU scout heading up."

19:43:22 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I'd just listen to the holo, and glance at it in between destroying drones."

19:43:27 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Telex here, an AEU scout is outbound."

19:43:28 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in Telex, an AEU scout has jumped out."

19:43:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:43:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You are confusing Repair Drones with Minidrones but yes you should go to the Battlesuit Outfitter and check the terminal for what you can equip your suit with and you should obtain the Minidrones and ok you should have Minidrones and a lasers more than likely or some other gun but you'd need ammunition which you will need to purchase."

19:43:37 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Old Frontier Processor, we detect an AEU scout inbound."

19:43:38 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Old Frontier Processor here, we detect an AEU scout inbound."

19:43:40 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is New Earth, AEU flitter heading for space."

19:43:59 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth here, an AEU flitter has jumped out."

19:44:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, it's a bit more tolerable with enemies. But before 'em..."

19:44:25 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I just did my best to speed run them, just to see how fast Ic ould get it done."

19:44:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Don't know that i'd try it with drones, but I would take a holo and listen to it without. I might do that again."

19:44:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm."

19:45:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How do ya operate your suit while holdin the holovid?"

19:45:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:45:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm gonna check to see what my suit has right now. I ended up transferring it to vermin."

19:45:11 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Speed runs were fun. Just take a time meter, hell I'd do it even with drones."

19:45:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well might be harder for you to do it MOrris, I wedged it between protuberant anatomy and kept my hands free. It's tight in my suit, so that works."

19:45:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Erm."

19:45:58 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "So creative."

19:46:03 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Carefully prop it inside with you, I just really need to keep it where Ican hear it."

19:46:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

19:46:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I...never mind."

19:46:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits an irritating burst of static.

19:46:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oops."

19:46:38 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I just tend to prop it up on my shoulder."

19:46:50 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I didn't say it was comfortable. That's why I only did it the one time."

19:46:56 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Serious question though, when do you exactly get enemies?"

19:46:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And it sits there? Lightning'd make me jump once and it'd be down buried somewhere."

19:47:05 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I dunn."

19:47:08 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Those corners are pokey."

19:47:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not sure Michael. Tier 2 suit maybe?"

19:47:27 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Ah, ok thanks."

19:47:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And I have the chaingun and microdrone modules installed. Those are the only two I can have though. Or really any two modules."

19:47:30 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I've been wondering that too."

19:47:40 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I have a 1.5 and I have them. Can't tell yo uwhen they showed up."

19:47:45 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If I find out before you michael I'll let you know, and vice versa."

19:47:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

19:48:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:48:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Look under abilities and be certain you purchase all that are available."

19:48:16 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I figure they just show up whenever your sites look tempting."

19:48:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I do solo Tesla so rarely. Somebody mentioned tier 2 once. Somebody else said they check your industry points fore they send ya someplace with drones. So I really don't know."

19:48:38 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Well, will find out soon enough."

19:48:44 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Just keep doing Tesla and it'll happen eventually."

19:48:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yep, sure did. Micro restoration."

19:49:00 [General Communication] "Y'all can't see me shudder." Morris Corlew chuckles.

19:49:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:49:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok then when you are in your battlesuit, be certain to press the COMMANDS button and set up those buttons so tht you can use micro Restoration."

19:49:37 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "It isn't that bad, this like my 18th for the day."

19:49:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Holy..."

19:49:51 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In any case. Whether or not you wedge it, balance, or whatever, I agree with you MOrris that it's a distraction."

19:49:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think I'd be dead at 4."

19:49:57 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

19:50:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's some dedication."

19:50:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:50:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "This is a separate ability from using Repair drones. Repair Drones are supplemental to using an ability."

19:50:11 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I can do three before I get bored. And three is pushing it."

19:50:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah I see."

19:50:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:50:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

19:50:29 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "That's why i'm talking to you guys, so I don't get bored."

19:50:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I can do one chamber fore I get bored, and that's pushin it."

19:50:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

19:50:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:50:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So yes that might help you a bit!"

19:51:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm still getting the hang of all this."

19:51:45 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

19:51:49 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

19:51:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

19:51:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But do not feel embarrassed over having to launch out if your damages are too great. It's better to be safe and also understand that Ground Combat can be rather challenging so don't rush. Read up if you have to before you go forward or just be willing to take your time."

19:52:07 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

19:52:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

19:52:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

19:52:24 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

20:00:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "See, with the AEu on strike, it's affecting even the League's ability to run beacons."

20:00:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the battlesuit tech should be bale to move it for you."

20:00:52 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If you're still looking when I do come back though, I"ll be happy to make other gunners look good."

20:02:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So they can sit there and look down there noses at us, but they rely on us too."

20:03:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Also grappling is still a bit tricky. Do you guys have any advice that I can use so that whatever I'm trying to get doesn't get destroyed by the."

20:03:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "The grapple? This comm hates me I swear."

20:03:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm so tired of their bs."

20:03:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Start at 45 degrees and move 15 degrees in either direction."

20:03:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Especially Morris and Erik."

20:03:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Same here."

20:03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah gotcha."

20:03:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I switched to starting at 10 a while back."

20:04:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You don't want it to spin fast."

20:04:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "10 is good because you'll get anything lower than that, and can move up in increments of 20."

20:04:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So, if it spins slower, you're going the right direction."

20:04:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Make sure the grapple is good enough for the grade. I usually start at one end then move back and forth as needed, reducing my angle changes until you hit it. Pay attention to how the chunk moves when you grapple it, for clues on how close you are getting. The slower it moves, the closer you are."

20:04:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or if it's spinning wildly, 40."

20:05:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Okay."

20:05:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I usually start at thirty myself. Where you start doesn't matter as much though, as how you respond to the chunk."

20:07:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli revealed to me yesterday that Best was vocal about leaving the Accord even before he was elected."

20:07:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't realize this. I sort of doubt there's anything we can do about it if the Union citizens knew he was going to do it and voted for him anyway."

20:09:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't really remember if he specifically said he wanted to leave the Accord. What we wanted was the fact that he promised ot open the civilian pilot program back up to new pilots."

20:09:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I can understand that. Garner had closed it off, right?"

20:10:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "For quite some time."

20:10:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah,m the other candidates didn't really talk about opening it back up."

20:12:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Prior to the election, we had basically 4 active pilots. That's not very many pilots."

20:12:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So to have my suit transferred from vermin to new earth, I'd talk to the tech on vermin, yes? Just need to make sure so I don't go stumbling around like a nitwit."

20:12:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah."

20:12:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's correct."

20:15:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I mean, there are other pilots and were other pilots, but hardly any of them were working at the time. We really needed new pilots."

20:15:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Too bad I can't get an air fort yet. That'd make thise a lot easier."

20:15:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

20:16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think mules only take 20 points."

20:16:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have 40 right now."

20:17:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But I already own three ships. One fighter, a cargo hauler and a flitter. I'll have to sell one of them I think."

20:17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, those are all you can have until you get your full license."

20:18:11 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Gate flight control, this is Providence Station, an AEU flitter has jumped in."

20:18:17 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth flight control here, we detect an AEU flitter inbound."

20:18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And go on beacons when you can. They're good for credits."

20:18:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "In the meantime the tech is free and easy to use, and if you ever do a nest or anything people are usually willing to come pick up your suit."

20:19:18 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth Orbit flight control, this is New Earth, AEU flitter on an incoming trajectory.  Clear the pad."

20:23:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's definitely seemed that way lately."

20:23:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And that can get to new cadets."

20:23:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's been that way for a while now."

20:38:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I can try a yes no one."

20:38:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And yeah, I really doubt that Morris and Ted would do anything to land themselves in prison. Especially something major that wouldd land them in prison for a long time."

20:39:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, then I reread the headline. It does still call it a resolution."

20:39:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

20:39:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's actually really hard to get punished."

20:39:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And really easy to get praised for saying things."

20:40:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ummm, not really. Ask some of those who have landed in priosn. Wait, you can't because they're still in prison."

20:40:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like they gave me that prototype because I said Lambeth might not have been willing to discuss things freely in front of that other guy at the meeting."

20:41:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And they've done nothing about me telling merchants to go home."

20:41:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, is that what it was for?"

20:41:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or setting up anti-best emssage beacons."

20:41:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, basically, it was a thank you for outing Lambeth as a traitor."

20:41:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, Takana got thrown into prison for making a deal with pirates."

20:41:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Honestly it's weird that they'd give their prototype fighter to a guy who has done these things."

20:41:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "There's no telling what I'll do with it."

20:42:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh."

20:45:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And about Frolov's silly analogy."

20:45:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "About selling a ship."

20:45:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which was 100% stupid."

20:46:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The real analogy is, I have a favorite sidewalk that I already let everyone walk on."

20:46:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why should I let you walk on it?"

20:46:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And the answer is because we spend billions of credits in their ports."

20:46:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly."

20:47:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:47:44 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:48:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And that wasn't negotiations. It's not negotiations if you just accept or not accept what the other side says. Negotiation is a process wherein both sides work to try to come to an agreement."

20:48:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "True."

20:49:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:51:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They wanted us to have the right offer for them. And how were we supposed to know this?"

20:51:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:51:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok well then there are a couple I have in mind. One is to be emphatic that the aEU Navy shall not attack the Mutuality. The other of course has to do with Eli and Ather's status. They naver should have been rogued for helping humanity no matter who it is especially that that particular group of unregs has never been hostile toward us or similar."

20:51:36 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

20:51:38 I don't see that here.

20:51:42 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

20:53:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops I said thar strangely but I think he knows what I mean."

20:53:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That rather."

20:53:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I might split that out into two polls actually, just to avoid another accusation of using persuasive language."

20:53:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:53:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure that works."

20:53:45 You nod. "I'm sure he figured it out."

20:53:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

20:53:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

20:53:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe one that says helping humans is the right thing to do, even if they're unregistered."

20:54:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And one that says Ather and Eli should have full status restored."

20:54:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You know, I'll put those up now."

20:54:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And maybe I'll send the results of the unreg one to the ISN."

20:54:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:54:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Still nobody persuaded anybody here. It's the government's doing to try to cause division amongst us. We all are together and yes that's great! The sooner the better!"

20:54:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it would be good to confirm our stance on this to the whole galaxy."

20:54:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I know, and I appreciate you saying that."

20:55:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I don't like when they outsmart me like that."

20:57:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily made the good suggestion that I offer up a proposal on your and Ather's status, Eli."

20:57:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hmm."

20:57:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I wanted to put up a second one confirming that we believe helping humans is right, even if the humans are unregs."

20:57:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought this one could be sent to the ISN."

20:57:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:57:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers.

20:57:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I want to make sure I don't word it in a way that is insulting to unregs."

20:58:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking "Helping humans in need is the right thing to do, even if the humans are unregistered.""

20:58:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:58:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I wouldn't call them Unreg outright and yes that's right."

21:03:03 The ship is not moving.

21:03:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why don't we have non-aggression with the Mutuality?"

21:03:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:03:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Because we have no diplomatic relations with the mutuality due to the slavers incident and otherwise."

21:03:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Pilot corps non-aggression treaties are independent of the actual dispositions of the involved alliances, right?"

21:04:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:04:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes but it has to be mutual."

21:04:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why wouldn't it be? I would think they would love to have us promise we will never take up arms against them, even if our government does."

21:05:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The reason why the others didn't even have to attend the QSA meeting was first League and Mutuality have a full alliance and Second, the Fringe have at least a NAP with Mutuality. We have nothing."

21:05:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We have tried to negotiate but oru Government hasn't made any effort to do so and we've gotten nowhere."

21:06:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Does the government need to be involved in treaties between pilot corps at all?"

21:06:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:06:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So our government points fingers at us for their lack of responsibility to the situation."

21:06:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They both sound like decen tideas, though Vernos already has tried to get our status removed. It can't hurt to try to do it with a resolution though."

21:06:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes, the governments must be involved."

21:06:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I know. They're not going to listen to any of these resolutions."

21:07:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, so we can't make diplomatic agreements ourselves."

21:07:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:07:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well it's worth an attempt and to at least inform everyone else what our preferences are."

21:07:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The government has to sign off on them."

21:07:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly."

21:10:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If we could have made diplomatic agreements without the government's inovlvement, it would have maybe made our guessing game meeting go a bit easier with the mutuality."

21:10:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Involvement that is."

21:10:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Beacons?"

21:11:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah it does."

21:11:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course the government doesn't care, because they want to discourage exploration."

21:12:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, we still have access to the rental battlesuit so we might still have access to the long-term rental ships. Anyone tried yet?"

21:12:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't tried, I just assumed we wouldn't."

21:12:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe we still do have access."

21:13:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Do we know we don't have access to Farport upgrades?"

21:13:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We know we don't have access to those upgrades. I tried myself."

21:13:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

21:16:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If I get a chance, I'll see if I can get someone with a carrier to take me over there and I'll try to buy a long-term rental ship."

21:19:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess having access to that would be nice, but that's really not that great."

21:19:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Without the Farport upgrades there's really no reason for me to get a tactical platform."

21:20:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

21:20:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, maybe that's not true."

21:20:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But it wouldn't be as good."

21:20:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Actually, the tactical platforms can be converted into nice storage ships too."

21:20:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh really? Are they better than medium transports?"

21:21:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, they can be."

21:21:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."

21:21:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:21:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah the only other purposes would be to create a gunship out of the fighters from Hyperion or to use it for trading and of course, I doubt we can buy scoops anymore but they do make great scooping vesels since we can't etend our storage beyond about 105k units."

21:21:44 You nod and grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:22:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone sighs.

21:22:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:22:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cutting ourselves off from all this tech."

21:22:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And for what? A slightly better fighter."

21:22:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I know. It bites."

21:23:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:23:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah and the interesting thing is that when we bring in tritium, tht is a very lucrative gain in resources but it seems that it's not important to our Government to realize that particular benefit."

21:23:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone sighs.

21:23:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Rogue President Eric Best."

21:24:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:25:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will likely pay for that one but somebody had to say it."

21:25:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The last thing I can think of is trying to rile up people on Hyperion."

21:25:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And then the other planets in turn."

21:25:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow! How did he get a protest permit?"

21:25:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Then try to get the lower house to call for a vote of no confidence."

21:25:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That would take a lot of time that we may not have though."

21:26:01 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "You might."

21:51:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Evenia, you had your coffee yet?"

21:52:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:52:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have. I figured you were on beacons is all."

21:53:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Got a question for ya."

21:53:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sure thing."

21:53:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How many felo did you switch out on my ships?"

21:54:05 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I didn't. I took off the maned, and I gave you those 3 steel."

21:54:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If I toldja I knew otherwise, would ya stick with that story?"

21:54:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "There was an orange maned kitten that I removed from the tug, and I put 3 steel felo on there ages ago."

21:54:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, I know bout the steel, and ya wrote me bout the maned. But what bout the telepaths?"

21:55:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What need do I have for those? Shit, you can go ahead and check on my ships. I don't have any."

21:56:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, let's just say I've seen some video of ya movin felo round from my ships to yours and vice versa...and saw so many clips I done lost count."

21:56:53 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well show me it. Because other than giving you that one felo I found that was normal, I never took any of them."

21:57:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll have to talk to spaceport security. They're the ones pulled it for me."

21:57:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I...do not understand why I would want to take someone's felo when I could just ask."

21:57:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Honestly, I don't either."

21:57:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Also consider the fact that your carrier was left unlocked. Did they show you the part where I locked it for you?"

21:58:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I dunno how long that thing was unlocked. But when I walked in and saw it was unlocked. I fixed that."

21:58:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They showed me you goin in and outta that ship with felo. How it got unlocked I dunno. I don't unlock that ship often."

21:58:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It was you on the video."

22:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "So...you're accusing me of...for some reason. taking your felo? right. okay. except the part where I don't need to take felo. and if I wanted a felo that bad. I'd just ask. Now none of us remember every move we make at every single moment. but I damn sure didn't take any for myself."

22:00:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyway, for folks that breed felo, especially if you're tryin to keep a line of felo Evenia might want, ya might wanna revoke her keys if she has 'em or not give her any."

22:00:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd think ya would, but considerin what I done seen, I'm wonderin why ya didn't except ya knew I was tryin hard to breed them telepaths to share with folks that wouldn't try and keep 'em a secret."

22:02:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just shows who ya can and can't trust. Give somebody an inch they'll take a whole sector."

22:03:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

22:04:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well I know this. Which was exactly why I poked my nose in when you were away, to make sure there weren't any maned on there. I don't need or want your felo. If I wanted one, I'd simply ask. You already knew of my interest anyway, since you mentioned you might be getting rid of those ships of felo. Or not getting rid, but you said the ships you have are far too many. So if my kindness in checking on animals means somehow I've done something wrong, I'll apologize. Good luck with your felo in the future."

22:04:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Considerin you were seen movin felo from the ships, and onto 'em...and not just the tug...that kinda don't hold water."

22:05:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can say whatcha want. But I know what I saw on them videos. I trusted ya...gave ya a chance. I shoulda known better. Burn me once shame on you, burn me twice, shame on me."

22:06:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm done with this conversation Morris. If you wanna not trust me that's fine. But I have zero reasons to take, your felo for myself."

22:06:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "All I know is what somebody saw and I checked video on. You can stick to your story, but video don't lie Evenia. Unlike you."

22:07:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Like I said Morris, this conversation is over in my opinion. Want your station ship keys back too?"

22:08:20 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll send 'em to ya right now. Don't wanna be accused of stealing things when I grab a module."

22:08:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I thought you were done with the conversation? Now you're bein petty."

22:08:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No. I'm being logical."

22:08:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean it ain't surprisin or nothin, but...it is what it is."

22:17:44 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:17:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a robotic chef named Nellie, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.

22:30:35 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Providence Station, we record an outbound AEU corvette."

22:30:36 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth Orbit flight control, this is Space Station Alpha, we record an inbound AEU corvette."
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:30:38 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:30:53 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in Providence Station, an EAOS transport has jumped in."

22:30:58 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Providence Station, we record an outbound EAOS transport."

22:30:59 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 003" has jumped into the sector.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Space Station Alpha, we record an inbound EAOS transport."

22:31:01 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 003! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

22:31:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:31:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:31:25 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:31:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:31:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in New Earth here, AEU corvette coming in to land."

22:31:33 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth to New Earth Orbit flight control, EAOS transport coming in to land."

22:31:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:31:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:31:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:31:43 You peer out...

22:31:43 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den", the two-person flare "Deadly Strike", and the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 003" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

22:31:45 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:31:49 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Have you already started the camp?"

22:31:53 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

22:32:06 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Be there shortly."

22:32:10 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "A Fringe 3 would be nice."

22:32:12 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:32:21 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "It is what I'm grabbin'."

22:32:24 You're already sitting.

22:32:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

22:32:32 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

23:26:25 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "They are, but I got boomed in one earlier today. Had a couple of those outsider drones on me and couldn't repair or kill them fast enough. Not fun."

23:26:42 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Woo."

23:27:13 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yep. It gave the phrase "up up and away" a whole new meaning. And not one that I like."

23:27:16 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Don't forget to flare."

23:27:53 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I can't flair. I have one of the rentals with microdrones and minigun, and that's it. Need to make more cash in order to get a better suit."

23:27:59 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

23:28:11 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You don't have to worry about flaring until you lead a nest or something."

23:28:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Try not to move through there too fast. Look before ya move. And check your damage from time to time."

23:28:35 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Heh yeah. I did one of the rat pods earlier. That was fun."

23:28:40 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Never rocked a rental."

23:28:44 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And that's what I did this last time."

23:29:02 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I like the rental, not a bad suit."

23:29:19 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Rentals aren't bad, but I can't wait to get a better suit. I see myself more as the kind of guy who likes to blow lots of shit up."

23:29:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Fringe suit?"

23:29:33 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Just make sure you are repaired all up before you move to face something else, and hey rentals are nice, the chainguns can be pretty damaging."

23:29:44 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Love rentals."

23:29:49 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah they can."

23:30:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rentals are ok as an early suit, but I was in one for too long for my tastes. I won't own one again if I can help it."

23:30:30 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "They are ok for soloing."

23:30:35 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll still probably keep this one around even when I get better suits, just in case."

23:30:41 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They have their merits I'm sure."

23:30:48 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I like how versatile they are. It's why I had one, they were good for RATS pods and the low deps."

23:30:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well by then you can get a tier 2...which is a lot nicer."

23:30:58 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Though for soloing I'd use a higher one."

23:32:01 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Detonators are fun too."

23:32:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Heh. Yeah they are."

23:32:41 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "What I've done is use one of those on a drone, then the minigun. Or do the minigun first and when it gets to like 88% damage, detonate."

23:33:23 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I kinda think it'd be neet if pilots could duel each other in ground combat. Unless we can and I just don't know about it."

23:33:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Only thing is you can only use 'em so often...and if ya run out, you're out. Suit only has place to hold 5."

23:33:33 You say, "I want to use one of those detenators on Morris while he's not in a battlesuit."

23:33:38 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah that sucks."

23:33:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We kinda can uh...play round on Tesla sites. We test things with suits that way."

23:33:53 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh fun."

23:34:07 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I would enjoy that I think."

23:34:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah...I mean you can do it other places too. We don't do it as a...like a free-for-all thing, just to test abilities we ain't used to or play with stuff see how suits are affected."

23:34:54 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "See I'd love to do a free-for-all kinda thing."

23:35:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That reminds me. I wish Ather'd done his free-for-all this year. Maybe next year."

23:36:00 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Maybe. Is that a fun thing?"

23:36:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The problem is that battlesuits can get very expensive to repair or replace in the higher tiers."

23:36:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah that is a downside."

23:36:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's a starship combat thing. He was considerin makin it more tournament style last I heard but then it never happened."

23:37:40 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah damn. See I can gun and engineer okay, but flying is not my forte. I may have gotten all my hours, but the actual flying in my test when it came down to combat was hell."

23:37:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll get there."

23:38:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And I can help you with flying."

23:38:20 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd like to get there a little faster, personally."

23:38:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just don't let nobody have ya fly a high cruiser beacon as your very first intro to combat flyin. And if somebody tries it...lemme know."

23:39:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know a couple basic patterns (east/west, north/south) that kinda thing, but anything more complex makes my brain go mushy."

23:39:12 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Morris will write them a flaming letter."

23:39:16 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Something tells me I'd end up getting the ship boomed."

23:39:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "Yep."

23:39:29 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ouch."

23:39:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's not best to fly set patterns."

23:39:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah. Too predictable?"

23:40:02 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Heh I did that flying my first combat ship on a low. I did better with someone else's the first three times. Got cocky I suppose. Or just sucked. Which is also possible."

23:40:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, let's just say there's pilots that'll do that to folks. And it's scared more than one pilot offa flyin combat."

23:40:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly. Seriously thouggh, I'd be happy to help you out."

23:40:32 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ouch. Yeah I really hope it doesn't happen to me."

23:40:43 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "It all depends on the person. I am a risk taker so that wouldn't have been so bad."

23:40:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Once I get a little more experience I'll see what we can do."

23:40:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Best I can tell ya is don't be afraid to say no. If ya ain't ready, ya ain't ready."

23:41:02 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits an irritating burst of static.

23:41:12 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "See, I'm not the kind of person who likes to take risks, especially nt with other peoples' ships."

23:41:33 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh the reason why I tried flying my own ship was so if I blew up it was my own ship and not someone else's. I didn't care so much about the ship, but I did get annoyed that I sucked as badly as I did."

23:41:40 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I doubt someone is really going to let you just go and blow up their billion credit ship."

23:41:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, if ya wanna work on it, lemme know. I can take ya out in a corvette or somethin, letcha fly a low and get used to it."

23:41:47 I don't understand that.

23:42:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No problem. We can practice in the simulators so you don't feel like you're risking anyone's ship."

23:42:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Wwas that a blanket invite, or directed just at Jacob Morris?"

23:42:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah, I'll help anybody wants it."

23:42:30 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm definitely willing to learn, so there's that. I tend to do better in controlled areas."

23:42:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Good deal. I might take you up on that at somep oint."

23:42:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That would be wise, I think."

23:42:54 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Let me assist you, Morris Corlew, we will teach you the ways of the exploding on overdriven beacons."

23:42:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure. Just gimme a holler."

23:43:00 [General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

23:43:01 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Kaboom, I say, kaboom."

23:43:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No thanks Keegan. I will not fly an overdriven."

23:43:12 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Kaboomski iis where the fun is at."

23:43:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's how I usually teach pilots how to fly and/or gun."

23:44:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "See, guning I was able to get in a relatively short amount of time. Same with enging."

23:44:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And both of those things are something that I enjoy doing."

23:44:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awesome! Well, just learn flying and put it all together and you'll do great!"

23:45:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Putting it together is where things start falling apart. I tend to focus on one task at a time."

23:45:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But here's hoping I'll get better."

23:45:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I can help you with that as well."

23:46:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I've been known to be pretty ruthless in a fighter."

23:46:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh man. Here's hoping I don't get on your bad side then."

23:46:45 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

23:46:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "Nah, I won't attack members of my own alliance."

23:57:44 Jacob,
I didn't want to say this over comms, but I highly discourage learning space combat from Morris. For one, he tends to get hit a lot and doesn't really care. This is not good as our ships cannot take as much damage as their ships can. Therefore, our flying strategy tends to be somewhat different than League pilots. I personally believe that people should learn space combat from their own alliance. That way, people have the opportunity to learn how to best use their own alliance's combat ships.
Best Regards,
Shule

23:58:10 You seal the envelope, and slide the envelope into the postal machine.

23:58:15 You glance at your communicator's screen.

23:58:15 You have one mail message.

23:58:18 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a letter. You quickly grab it off the belt.

23:58:26 Dear Shule,

I know, and I thank you for it, and I'd like to try it again.  I"m going to practice some with the simulators first.  That helped with my gunning, and i"m sure it'll help with the piloting.  When I get to that point, i'll call you first.  I'm not wild about Morris, but I'm also trying to maintain bridges there which is what led to the question.  You never know when you need someone's help and the only person you can call on is someone you don't like much.  Better to be civil and practice diplomacy than to be left hanging cause you've cut all lines of communication.  Take care,

Lexie
