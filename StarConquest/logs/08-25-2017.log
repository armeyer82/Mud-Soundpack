02:39:20 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows partially obscured by sheer gold curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, a large bureau, a pair of cotton briefs, a pair of black corduroy jeans, and some black leather boots here.
You can go out.

03:01:10 I see no "polo" here.

03:01:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

03:01:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You can certainly inquire if they will sell you one though."

03:01:24 a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it

03:01:24 Contoured to evenly absorb and redistribute weight from the stress points of a human body, this smooth black, densely cushioned couch is broad and long enough to lie on.
On top of it you see a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt, a long-sleeved black tee with a large neon pink starburst appliqued on the front, a lavender lace demi bra, a pair of soft lavender silk bikini panties, a long-sleeved black tee with a large neon purple dragon appliqued on the front, a dark pink lace bullet bra, a pair of soft dark pink silk bikini panties, a pretty purple halterneck top with a ruffled neckline, a white lace bullet bra, a pair of skinny blue low rise jeans, a pair of white panties trimmed with eyelet lace and purple ribbons, a pair of body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with periwinkle blue and coral pink jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets, a pair of blue low rise denim jeans, a stretchy long-sleeved light blue top with a colorful dragonfly print, a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, and a soft blush pink cotton bra decorated with a tiny ribbon rosette in the center.

03:01:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Would be a nice upgrade."

03:01:51 You say, "Sec, I'll be right back. Going to go check the SDC office one more time before I go to sleep."

03:01:56 You remove a long-sleeved black tee with a large neon pink starburst appliqued on the front from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:01:59 You pull a long-sleeved black tee with a large neon pink starburst appliqued on the front on over your head.

03:02:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok you can take this ship."

03:02:02 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:02:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:02:07 You scramble to your feet.

03:02:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:02:10 You exit the ship.

03:02:10 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

03:02:16 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

03:02:16 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:02:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:02:17 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:02:18 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

03:02:19 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:02:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:02:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:02:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:02:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:02:28 You are already wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large neon pink starburst appliqued on the front.

03:02:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh ok then I said you could take Dove as I'm not going anywhere in particular."

03:02:35 The ship is already moving.

03:02:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:02:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:02:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:02:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:02:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:02:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:02:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:02:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:02:44 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:02:45 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:02:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:02:46 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

03:02:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:02:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:02:49 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:02:52 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

03:02:52 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

03:02:53 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:02:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:02:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:03:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, sorry. Didn't hear you."

03:03:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:03:09 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:03:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

Subject: Regarding Helios Felo Tonic
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 19:14 24 August 2317 GST
--
Howdy, folks. I received this letter from 'Doc' Anatolius of Stavros in response to a photo I sent him of one of the felo that the tonic from Helios was used on.

--

To whom it may concern:

Firstly, thank you for bringing this to my attention.

These creatures, while beautiful, are an unintended side effect from triggering the felo gene reexpression
 hormone. This genetic realignment can be seen in the 'wild' by introducing felo to a bari infestation. The
 next generation of felo will contain more aggressive characteristics that are commonly called 'soldier' felo.

However, this treatment regimen forces immediate reexpression of its genetics as opposed to requiring the
 next generation to arise. The intended effect was to vastly increase its lifespan beyond normal expectations
 versus Miracle Tonic(TM), and is effective in a double-blind study against Miracle Tonic(TM), placebo, and
 my formulation. Unfortunately, it seems that the compound is somewhat more sensitive than expected. Human
 DNA on the felo may cause expression of human-like characteristics. Similarly, melanocytes are easier to
 create than take away, which means that the flesh coloration will trend towards deep browns, excepting
 instances of albinism in any contaminant and within the felo's genome.

My team will consider researching a more 
04:22:24 robust formulation that is less sensitive to contamination, but we
 suspect that to reliably increase lifespan beyond that which is provided by the Miracle Tonic(TM), a large
 (and thus sensitive to contamination such as the current formulation) dose may be required. There are some
 analogues that we might explore, but that has not had much energy applied to it.

Similarly, I postulate that a human proving to be a constant threat towards a nest of felo will develop
 similar characteristics in order to best ensure survival. However, this is far beyond the pale and I condemn
 anyone who attempts such experiments - humane treatment of living things is very important for ethical
 science.

Finally, there seems to be a misconception that this formulation contains mutagen or is tainted with the DNA
 of some individual or another. It does not, and would be quite safe to drink if one were so inclined, though
 I do not advise anyone to. The primary active ingredient of it is a solution of felo genetic reexpression
 hormone and a carefully selected stimulus to trigger extended lifespans.

Love,
Anatolius of Stavros

07:43:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No idea. I am pretty sure Aisling was. I honestly don't know though."

07:43:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, I thought you had told me something about that, but I might have just gotten my facts mixed up in the confusion of our ridiculous lives."

07:43:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I can ask Lily or whoever about it."

07:43:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Did you have something you wanted to show me?"

07:44:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't at the moment, it might not be finished anyways."

07:44:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, no worries."

07:46:30 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

07:48:30 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker.

07:56:31 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

08:10:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constantine, you should come up here if you can."

08:10:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just for a minute."

08:12:31 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo seems to be hungry.

08:12:31 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo approaches a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

08:15:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Rocka Rolla". The organization has earned 755,376.26 credits.

08:21:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

08:21:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

08:21:21 The starship is already moving.

08:21:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

08:21:46 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a thick cream piece of paper with an official header reading "From the Voice of the Corps". You quickly grab it off the belt.

08:21:56 --
Shule,
 
I hate to dredge up the QSA meeting again, but the liaison office is telling me that the reason no agreement was reached is because "the Mutuality refused to properly discuss any particular trade option." This was not my understanding of what you guys said happened at the negotiations or my understanding of what you said happened at the meeting we had with Mr. Lambeth about the negotiations. I thought I would ask one last time for you to clarify your thoughts on what happened, in writing, so that we might have a more permanent record and the opportunity to present the information to the liaison office, if necessary.
 
Did we offer anything specific in return for QSA access? Did the council explicitly explain why they weren't interested in these offers?
 
Did the council ever explicitly state what they wanted in return for QSA access? If so, what was it that they wanted?
 
Was the encroachment into Mutuality space by the AEU fleet brought up at all during the negotiations? If so, by which party, and in what context?
 
There's no rush to answer, I just wanted to straighten these details out for myself and for the office in case we ever reopen negotiations. This is looking less and less likely, at least in the near future, but at least this way some future Voice serving in less mad times will have more detailed notes about the chain of events.
 
I beg to remain your most humble and obediant servant,
Consta

08:22:48 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

08:22:48 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The vostok-class capsule "Hummingbird Express", the four-person mule "Lion's Den", and the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" are landed here.

08:24:47 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

08:24:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:24:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:24:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:24:52 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

08:42:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

08:43:05 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Storage Room]

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The vostok-class capsule "Hummingbird Express", the four-person mule "Lion's Den", the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

09:15:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

09:15:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

09:15:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

09:15:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

09:15:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth here, AEU corvette launching."

09:15:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:17:53 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

11:17:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.

11:55:30 You say to Lily, "I did too."

11:55:42 --
Lily,
 
I hate to dredge up the QSA meeting again, but the liaison office is telling me that the reason no agreement was reached is because "the Mutuality refused to properly discuss any particular trade option." This was not my understanding of what you guys said happened at the negotiations or my understanding of what you said happened at the meeting we had with Mr. Lambeth about the negotiations. I thought I would ask one last time for you to clarify your thoughts on what happened, in writing, so that we might have a more permanent record and the opportunity to present the information to the liaison office, if necessary.
 
Did we offer anything specific in return for QSA access? Did the council explicitly explain why they weren't interested in these offers?
 
Did the council ever explicitly state what they wanted in return for QSA access? If so, what was it that they wanted?
 
Was the encroachment into Mutuality space by the AEU fleet brought up at all during the negotiations? If so, by which party, and in what context?
 
There's no rush to answer, I just wanted to straighten these detail out for myself and for the office in case we ever reopen negotiations. This is looking less and less likely, at least in the near future, but at least this way some future Voice serving in less mad times will have more detailed notes about the chain of events.
 
I beg to remain your most humble and obediant servant,
Constant

22:26:59 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'll just float over new earth and issue please for no trade, unless New Earth is now no longer being targeted."

22:29:02 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Telex, AEU scout incoming."

22:29:11 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, I don't like using message beacons because if most pilots are like me, they eventually stop paying attention to those sector messages."

22:29:18 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I perfer to personalize."

22:30:42 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm sure everyone noticed it, but how many people didn't start to just kinda tune the message out after the first few times?"

22:30:43 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Space Station Delta to The Glittering Belt flight control, Fringe transport heading up."

22:30:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what it's sposed to do."

22:31:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've only seen it once Ather. So I dunno."

22:31:01 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yeah, but like... I would ignore it if I were a merchant."

22:31:46 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Hoyt Moonbase, an AEU transport has jumped out."

22:31:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:32:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm hoping so. If the amounts that merchant trade was down earlier was any indication, I'm not encouraged. I'd rather see 7% go up to at least 77%."

22:32:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. I hear ya. But 7% on what...the first day? That's pretty impressive."

22:32:28 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth flight control here, AEU scout coming in to land."

22:32:41 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,088,506.35 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

22:32:57 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Even 7% can be worth a LOT of credits."

22:33:12 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "That is true. Do all of our AEU sectors have message beacons in them?"

22:33:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "7% is a good-sized dent. It ain't what ya want it to be, but it's definitely a start."

22:33:51 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na. I think they only put them at major beacon hubs."

22:34:07 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah, I see."

22:34:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's only in one."

22:34:16 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which works well enough, since everyone has to pretty much cross through those hubs most times unless they're doing an in-cluster trade."

22:34:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I honestly didn't notice if it was at New Earth or at uh...the main beacon...shoot...whatever that thing's called."

22:34:26 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, it's only in one?"

22:34:37 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "It was."

22:34:39 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's in Providence Gate."

22:35:06 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Maybe I should have dispensation shit one out over riverway and the other beacon clusters."

22:35:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:35:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They did it that way so the thing would keep annoying merchants when they had to keep skipping through there."

22:35:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rather unsanitary."

22:35:39 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hoyt Moonbase here, we record an inbound AEU transport."

22:35:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There should be one at cheynne's Star and Riverway too."

22:36:20 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hoyt Moonbase to Hoyt Orbit flight control, AEU transport on an incoming trajectory.  Clear the pad."

22:36:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I think shitting out a station, even a message beacon would be more than a bit painful."

22:36:33 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Space Station Delta, we record an outbound AEU destroyer."

22:36:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Least it's the constructor doin it and not one of us."

22:36:58 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It certainly has a big enough ass to shit out a station."

22:37:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constantine suggested we change the message, not sure if either of us has ctually gotten around to it. Doing it from our ships seems to work better anyways."

22:37:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh. Well my information is not up to date, then."

22:37:21 [General Communication] Prichard Grant transmits, "That is a wonderful mental image."

22:37:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The messages all still look the same, tis true."

22:37:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do any of them have invaders parts?"

22:37:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No."

22:37:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can change the messages!"

22:37:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah, you suck."

22:38:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn' thave time to get your approval, wasn't sure how you'd feel about that."

22:38:10 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Providence Station, an AEU destroyer has jumped in."

22:38:15 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station flight control here, we record an outbound AEU destroyer."

22:38:15 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Space Station Alpha, an AEU destroyer has jumped in."

22:38:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'd rather the constructor shit it out than me. I mean ow. Imagine trying to crap out that huge salvage xeno thing we used to build?"

22:38:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
22:38:41 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

22:38:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, anything that will help discourage trade at AEU ports for the time being that doesn't constitute a direct threat to any and all persons that are not allied pirates, other form of pirates or anyone we're not at war with is a go."

22:38:54 I don't understand that.

22:43:42 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Telex, a Fringe transport is outbound."

22:43:42 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Space Station Delta here, we detect a Fringe transport inbound."

22:43:47 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Space Station Delta here, Fringe transport coming in to dock."

22:43:50 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hoyt Orbit flight control, this is Hoyt Moonbase, we record an inbound AEU transport."

22:43:53 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

22:44:37 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hoyt Moonbase here, AEU transport incoming."

22:44:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:45:04 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

22:45:50 You say to Lily, "Going to go check the office. I'll be right back."

22:45:51 You scramble to your feet.

22:45:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:45:52 You exit the ship.

22:45:52 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

22:45:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

22:45:56 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:45:58 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:45:58 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:45:59 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:45:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:46:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:46:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:46:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:46:15 The ship is already moving.

22:46:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:46:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:46:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:46:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:46:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:46:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:46:24 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Gate flight control, this is Providence Station, an AEU corvette has jumped in."

22:46:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:46:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:46:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

22:46:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:46:26 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

22:46:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:46:29 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Zeta-3" has jumped into the sector.

22:46:29 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station here, an AEU scout has jumped in."
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Gate flight control, this is Providence Station, an AEU corvette is outbound."
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Space Station Alpha, we record an inbound AEU corvette."
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:46:29 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station to Providence Gate flight control, we record an inbound AEU scout."

22:46:32 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:46:35 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:46:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hiya Shule."

22:46:41 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

22:46:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Tara."

22:46:51 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:46:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

22:46:54 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "The Glittering Belt flight control, this is Space Station Delta, Fringe transport launching."

22:46:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:47:13 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Space Station Delta, a Fringe transport has jumped out."

22:47:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:47:21 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:47:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone on that Transport?"

22:47:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:47:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in New Earth, AEU corvette coming in to land."

22:47:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:47:41 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:47:43 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Hoyt Moonbase, AEU transport launching."

22:47:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not sure. I just woke up."

22:47:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:47:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:47:48 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

22:47:48 You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:47:49 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Obliteration" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

22:47:51 You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.
You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

22:47:56 I don't understand that.

22:48:00 You remove the 20:00 25/08 AEU space defense report from a brushed steel desk.

22:48:03 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is Hoyt Moonbase, an AEU transport is outbound."

22:48:03 In addition, there appears to be some writing on the 20:00 25/08 AEU space defense report...

23:31:30 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch
