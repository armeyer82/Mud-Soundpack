-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow
bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

schedule changed drastically recently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm going to
make every effort but I don't know if I can last until ten."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Ah, I sympathize. But
I do hope you last until ten. I believe a couple of our cadets have stated they
will try to be there as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits an irritating
burst of static.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Er, sorry. That
is good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "We have had a few
cycle through without reaching their full license during the course of your
expedition, however, so I cannot say if they will last."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah we have a
lot of retention issues. Honestly so many of us being gone probably didn't
help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Agreed. I was able to
offer pointers here and there, but I am not quite well grounded enough to
confidently take people out on beacons or any such thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll get you
there. I should be back to work more regularly in a couple days."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I am happy to hear it.
It will be nice having others around with a measure of consistency. I do think I
managed to keep rather productive myself, in the interim. I made a small fortune
and then spent it all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's the pilot's
curse. Buy anything good?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "A rift drive for my
scout and a two-person transport were the largest purchases, but they've proven
quite valuable to have. Then various ship upgrades and, ahm. A few small
fighters, during my period of learning the nature of solo beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh cool,
congrats on the drive. And don't worry about the fighters, we've all lost
several."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I once bought
and outfitted a new fighter to use on very high beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forgot to put
a battery on it though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Oh dear."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Needless to say
I was blown up immediately."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Batteries and engines
do make those beacons far more manageable. Though highs and very highs will be
out of reach for a time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll be doing
highs pretty soon I'm sure. I think you only really need about 1000 combat for
the best stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The engine and
lasers that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "True, though I only
passed three hundred early this morning, so that still feels a way off. But I am
not too impatient on that point."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow, are we relaly
the only two active pilots for this meeting?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "It looks as though we
are. I was starting to grow concerned that I had the time wrong."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't, you don't.
This is disappointing, especially due to what I wanted to share with the corps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Constantine was here
earlier and said that he would try to make it, but I believe he may have passed
out. He said something about a different sleep schedule pulling him around. I
saw Emmelie on the communicator an hour ago or so, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa sighs.

it, put it away."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Alright. I'll be a
minute to drop it off, then. Is a communicator fine to bring along?"

Dear Mr. Elemmire,
Congratulations! We have decided to accept your application to purchase and
operate an AW-2 AEU Flare-class Twin-Assault Vessel!
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses had your application
reviewed by the finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your
service as a pilot. At the conclusion of this process, it was decided that you
were well qualified to operate this equipment.
Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your new acquisition!
Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

'More than a week ago, the current AEU administration decided, foolishly I might
add, to allow the Rogue Navy to return home.
'First of all, this is highly insulting to those pilots both from the AEU, and
from all other alliances who worked so hard to fight the Outsiders after the
Rogue Navy's intentional acts against the very survival of humanity.
'I am of course, referring to the activation of a beacon in Mutuality space,
which would reveal one of the last major holdouts that the Outsiders needed to
begin systematically destroying all vestages of our race.
'Those elements of the Rogue navy who are returning to AEU-held territories
should be tried for treason, at the very least, and be imprisoned for life as a
result of their actions. We all have consciences. Those who did not believe in
Kendra Janus's orders should have done something about them rather than act on
them and commit treason not only against the AEU, but against humanity as a
whole. Even their silence is inexcusable.
'This action is one of a series of poor actions by this administration. An
administration that I might add, some of us hoped would do some good, after the
disappointing Garner admininstration before it. Instead, it is only making
poorer and poorer decisions.
'First and foremost, the civilian pilots of the AEU condemn the belief and words
of President Best saying that Unregistered peoples are not considered humans. We
are all humans, whether we're registered or unregistered.
'Additionally, we condemn the administration's actions for leaving the Accord,
as well as attempting to privatize the AEU pilot corps.
'Things have been building up for a while with the civilian pilots. The allowing
of the AEU navy back into AEU space however, has forced us to act in a manner we
normally would never even consider.
'We refuse to consider the heartless, patetic individuals of the Rogue navy, who
decided to hand over the fate of our entire species to a tyranical race as AEU
citizens. In fact, if we are talking levels of humanity, every member of the
Rogue Navy is less human than even the most ruthless of unregistered
individuals.
'Therefore, today, we the civilian pilots of the AEU have decided that we will
begin systematically targeting all AEU naval vessels for destruction. We see
you, we will shoot you down.
'Hostilities will be initiated approximately twenty-four hours after this
broadcast. In the meantime, we ask those of you on all AEU planets to rise up
and fight against this administration. Especially those loyal members of the AEU
navy who feel as strongly as we do about the decision to allow those traitoress
members of the Rogue Navy back into the fold. You have twenty-four hours to
decide if you are going to stay on the side which would allow traitors to your
entire race back home without any punishments, or if you want to fight for
what's right. Obviously, if you're on our side, we will not be shooting you
down.
'A note to all the other alliances, however. This is our fight. We ask you to
not engage against any AEU forces in AEU sectors unless you are crewing on an
AEU ship. There is no reason for anyone else to get involved.
'Additionally, we also ask you all to avoid all AEU sectors for the time being,
if you have not done so already for your own safety, and to do your part to
boycott all AEU stores and locations. Buy nothing that is sold by any AEU
corporation or shop for the time being. This includes all starship upgrades and
battlesuits.
'All questions can be directed to me. Bases of operation have already been
established for staging points. If anyone wants to crew on any AEU warships they
can make private inquiries regarding these bases of operation.
'This is a sad day for our alliance, my fellow citizens of the Union. A civil
war is not what I had in mind, and is not at all what the civilian pilots
wanted.
'However, if a civil war is the only thing that this administration is willing
to listen to, then a civil war is exactly what they will have.
'I wish you all a good night.

Apartments are places that your character can rent and furnish to their liking.
You will find several apartment buildings scattered across planets and space
stations.
Apartments require an initial deposit, as well as rent paid once a month. This
rent is due on the first day of every month. If your rent is more than two
months overdue, you will lose access to your apartment and eventually be
evicted.
RENTING AN APARTMENT
You can register for your apartment from any apartment lobby with the REGISTER
command. This will offer you a selection of floors where you can place your
apartment. Generally, each floor has a different apartment layout, so pay
attention to how many bathrooms and other rooms you'll be getting, as well as
extra features. Bigger apartments have higher rent, of course. You can only own
one apartment in each apartment complex.
You also pay your rent in the lobby by simply using the RENT command.
If you wish to permanently move out of your apartment, use the MOVE command.
Since you can only rent one apartment per building, you must do this if you wish
to upgrade to a better apartment.
VISITING AN APARTMENT
If you're inside an apartment, you can type OPEN DOOR to allow others to enter
freely. You'll want to close the door again afterwards, of course.
If you are visiting an apartment, you may use the BUZZ command in the lobby to
let the residents know that you've arrived.
MANAGING OTHER RESIDENTS
You have two commands controlling who can freely enter your apartment: ALLOW and
DISALLOW. They do about what you'd expect. You must use them while inside your
apartment.
As the original renter of the apartment, you will always be responsible for its
rent, no matter who else might be living there.
REPURPOSING ROOMS
You might have noticed that your new apartment is filled with a lot of empty
rooms! You can fix this with the REPURPOSE command. This will change the room's
name and default description, letting you lay out your apartment however you
like.
Certain rooms cannot be moved, such as bathrooms. You are not a space plumber.
Furnishing is entirely up to you!
LUXURY FEATURES
Once your character is wealthy enough, you may end up renting a place at a
luxury apartment complex or building. These places tend to have a few extra
features:
* Restricted access: Most of the building is inaccessible to people who are not
residents.
* Special rooms: Residents may enjoy a private pool, gym, lounge, or other
features.
* Mail room: Residents may reroute their mail to a mail room inside the
building.
* Self-storage: A self-storage room may be available to safely store your large
items. Only residents of your apartment can access your self-storage unit.
* Concierge phone service: Check the lobby for a number for the front desk. The
concierge will let you pay your rent over the phone, or call a taxi to and from
your building.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened
metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow
lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate
where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent
atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. The paint seems
rather worn here, as though Dock One tends to be preferred despite being
identical to the other three. A ramp leads up to the rest of the station.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The glory of the endless expanse of starry space is revealed here through the
transparent dome over this small but elegant restaurant. A spiral staircase in
the center of the restaurant leads down to the main level of the station, and
luxurious black carpeting covers the floor, extending outward to a long
silver-trimmed black plasteel bar encircling the room. Cushioned black leather
bar stools are arranged along the bar, and on the other side is a black plasteel
waiter droid which moves with quiet efficiency to fill customers' orders. A
two-meter-high wall of shiny black plasteel around the outside of the bar
contains notices and a few other photographs and mementos. You see a framed
photo of several pilots gleefully kicking a downed Outsider, a large glossy
photo of a beautiful green planet in space, a small photograph of a pile of

To Esteemed President Best and members of the AEU government:
The AEU Pilot Corps is concerned with talk of potentially withdrawing our
contributions to the Accord, both in personnel and funding. We believe this to
be a mistake, and strongly urge the government to reconsider this action. The
threat of the Outsiders, the IFS as well as attacks by pirate factions still
occur on a fairly frequent basis. The Outsiders especially, are a grave concern.
They could return at any time, and if nothing else, overwhelm us all just by
sheer numbers.
In order to combat the threats both within our own borders and in alliance space
in general, we need to all work together. The Accord functions as a central
means for all of the alliances who are involved to contribute resources and
money to make those resources into something useable to combat the threats that
we all encounter on a daily basis. Additionally, the Accord functions as a means
of gathering the relevant intelligence which we tend to use in order to combat
our enemies effectively and with minimal losses.
The AEU has some of the best scientists, who have made some incredible
discoveries and helped further our efforts to combat the dangers we all face.
Our navy, full of the bravest men and women in the alliance have fought
valiantly in many engagements against Outsiders, IFS and even Allied Pirates.
Even the civilian pilots have served in an exemplary manner, having once been at
the forefront of helping to defend all of the alliances in times of invasion.
However, as great as our scientists are, as skilled and brave as our great men
and women in the navy are and as dedicated to the defense of our space as the
civilian pilots may be, the AEU cannot combat the threats to our space alone. We
need to remain in the Accord therefore, to share intelligence and receive
intelligence in turn. We must continue funding the Accord, so that they can
continue to build the ships and weapons which we can use to assist in combatting
our enemies. We need to commit personnel to help defend the space of all other
alliances, so that we too can be safe. We need to allow our scientists to work
with the Accord and the EAOS, so that we can continue to gain advantages over
those who would desire to see nothing more than the downfall of the alliances,
and more importantly, the extinction of the entire human race.
We thank you for taking the time to review our statement, and hope that you will
ultimately do what is in the best interests of humanity, and our alliance.

Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa

Best if anything."

[The Torus; Torus Restaurant]
The glory of the endless expanse of starry space is revealed here through the
transparent dome over this small but elegant restaurant. A spiral staircase in
the center of the restaurant leads down to the main level of the station, and
luxurious black carpeting covers the floor, extending outward to a long
silver-trimmed black plasteel bar encircling the room. Cushioned black leather
bar stools are arranged along the bar, and on the other side is a black plasteel
waiter droid which moves with quiet efficiency to fill customers' orders. A
two-meter-high wall of shiny black plasteel around the outside of the bar
contains notices and a few other photographs and mementos. You see a framed
photo of several pilots gleefully kicking a downed Outsider, a large glossy
photo of a beautiful green planet in space, a small photograph of a pile of

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

situation like this, which brings about this question. If you are rifting some
place with an autolander station at your destination, but the travel getting
there is going to take a few hours, is it safe to go take a shower or go get
something to eat while you're traveling, since you will presumably land if you
get t here before you return to the keys?"
[Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "In theory. I've had the autolander fail
to work a few times, but that's generally what they're for."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In theory yes. But there is always the
chance of an enemy ship at the other end. If that's the case and it shoots you,
you will not autoland. The other option is to trim down, slowing your speed more
so you'll be back at the keys in time."

that can perform that function."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow
bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster

purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

giving them our tacet support to do whatever they want to do and bash however
they want to bash."

perfectly comfortable.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Lily,
Over the last eight to nine months, I have watched as our careers have gone from
being starship pilots to politicians and diplomats. I became a pilot because I
loved the stars and not because I love politics. Action after action has either
fell on deaf ears or has been rebuked or thwarted by our government. We no
longer live under a democracy, but that of a dictatorship. Therefore, before the
current political climate destroys the alliance that I love so much, I feel it
would be best for me to spend an extended amount of time with my family and the
people back home.
I cannot promise or guarantee when I will return to work. Therefore, I cannot
ask you nor expect you to wait for me. If you have an opportunity to move on
from our relationship, I will be deeply saddened, but it would be unfair for me
to ask you to wait. 
Just know this, I love you with all my heart and I am so honored and privileged
to have met you and worked with you. Of all of the stars we have seen and been
close to, our relationship, our friendship will always be the brightest star in
my life. Take care my dearest, most beautiful and wonderful love.
Forever Yours,

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
