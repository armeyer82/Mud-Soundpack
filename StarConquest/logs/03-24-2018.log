00:02 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

00:03 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm gonna get some ramen I think."

00:03 Hawthorn Dunn ambles north.

00:04 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

00:04 Hawthorn Dunn sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

00:04 Hawthorn Dunn retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into his mouth.

00:06 Keegan Wantz says, "Delicious ramens."

00:06 Keegan Wantz says, "Coulda swore Lily brought other food."

00:06 Keegan Wantz strides north.

00:06 Hawthorn Dunn takes a bite of a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.

00:06 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

00:06 Keegan Wantz says, "That is.. a shitton of fish."

00:06 Keegan Wantz takes a bite of a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.

00:07 Hawthorn Dunn says, "That's really good."

00:07 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh. Wonder where I can get one of these."

00:08 Hawthorn Dunn takes several bites of a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.

00:08 Keegan Wantz says, "Out at Feng Wo."

00:08 Keegan Wantz nods.

00:09 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "That it?"

00:09 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Aww man."

00:09 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "How do you get there?"

00:09 Hawthorn Dunn retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of the bowl and slurps them up.

00:09 Keegan Wantz says, "Pretty longgggggggg rift travel."

00:09 Keegan Wantz says, "Easiest with someone who has the chart."

00:09 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh."

00:09 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well that's going to be difficult."

00:10 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

00:11 Keegan Wantz nods.

00:12 Keegan Wantz says, "I can't read Antispinward at all."

00:12 Keegan Wantz says, "Can do a litttttttle bit of Rimward, but it's not easy."

00:12 Keegan Wantz says, "The Feng Wo chart is definitely antispinward, though."

00:12 Keegan Wantz shrugs.

00:13 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh."

00:14 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'd like to read some charts, but I mean this stuff really isn't my wheelhouse."

00:18 Keegan Wantz says, "Can't really read them without a lot of instruction."

00:18 Keegan Wantz says, "Ather here knows Spinward primarily, if I recall correctly."

00:18 Keegan Wantz says, "But doesn't neccessarily want to teach."

00:18 Keegan Wantz says, "In fact, I'd wager he doesn't care to teach."

00:18 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

00:18 Hawthorn Dunn shrugs.

00:19 Hawthorn Dunn says, "It's not that important to me really. I guess it'd be nice if we had more people who could do that, but I mean we're just starting to really do this from what it sounds like."

00:19 Hawthorn Dunn says, "The exploration thing, I mean."

00:20 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

00:20 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

00:21 Keegan Wantz says, "This will be the.. third Fringe expedition ever, if I recall correctly."

00:21 Keegan Wantz says, "Not counting miniature trips every now and again."

00:21 Keegan Wantz says, "We've had a few.. bad experiences, we'll go with."

00:21 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "How bad exactly?"

00:22 Keegan Wantz says, "Almost ending humanity bad."

00:22 Keegan Wantz says, "I was on the crew where this happened, but we left from Mutuality space."

00:22 Keegan Wantz says, "Not a huge deal in its own right, but."

00:22 Keegan Wantz says, "The pod was pointed at Helios."

00:22 Keegan Wantz says, "So the Outsiders got a rough heading to a place they didn't know about."

00:23 Hawthorn Dunn says, "...So, not bad turned into really really bad."

00:23 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo."

00:24 Keegan Wantz says, "We lost the exploration vessel, kinda a pain in the wallet and resources in its own right."

00:24 Keegan Wantz says, "But then we -also- pointed the pod at Helios."

00:24 Ather says to Keegan, "Yet they still allowed Gray to become a perminent EAOS citizen."

00:24 Keegan Wantz says, "So bad turned into 'really fucking bad'"

00:25 Keegan Wantz says, "Yep."

00:25 Keegan Wantz says, "People are like KEEGAN PUSHED THE PING BUTTON, which, sure, didn't help."

00:25 Keegan Wantz says, "But we were -already- in Outsider territory."

00:25 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

00:25 Keegan Wantz says, "We didn't know it at the time, however."

00:25 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I...huh yeah it seems like you're already screwed at that point."

00:25 Keegan Wantz says, "The apparent region display came about after that."

00:26 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well... one good thing came from it? Not that it's uh... good."

00:35 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

00:35 Keegan Wantz says, "Bright sides."

00:36 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Right?"

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Hm."

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn tips the bowl into his mouth and drinks the richly flavored broth, finishing it off.

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn scrambles to his feet.

00:40 Hawthorn Dunn ambles north.

00:41 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

00:45 Keegan Wantz takes several bites of a serving of hot chicken-flavored ramen in a small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.

00:45 Keegan Wantz says, "Space is fairly big."

00:45 Keegan Wantz says, "Might take a bit to run into anything."

00:49 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm glad I got nothing but time. I'm just hoping to see a planet system."

00:50 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

00:52 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

00:58 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

00:58 Keegan Wantz stretches.

01:06 Keegan Wantz yawns.

01:06 Keegan Wantz retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of the bowl and slurps them up.

01:06 Keegan Wantz says, "Gonna catch a quick nap."

01:06 Keegan Wantz salutes sharply.

01:06 Keegan Wantz tips the bowl into his mouth and drinks the richly flavored broth, finishing it off.

01:07 Blake Madison waves to Keegan Wantz.

01:07 Keegan Wantz says, "If I'm not awake in an hour, yell at me on the PA."

01:07 Blake Madison says, "Will do."

01:07 Keegan Wantz salutes sharply.

01:07 Keegan Wantz strides north.

01:09 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

01:16 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

01:17 Lily Kaise glides north.

01:18 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

01:18 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

01:18 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a serving of hot spaghetti with a creamy sauce flavored with garlic and parmesan in a shallow bowl.

01:22 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

01:22 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

01:28 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:28 Clarina Taylor exclaims, "Aha!"

01:28 Blake Madison says, "Hmm."

01:28 Blake Madison asks, "We wanna go after it?"

01:28 Clarina Taylor says, "I think hmm."

01:28 Ather Jammoa strides north.

01:29 You venture through a side door.

01:29 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

01:29 Blake Madison says into the PA microphone, "You got it Ather?"

01:29 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure, why not?"

01:29 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:29 A readout shows Pre-Stellar Object 4007-4214 about 18.28 light-grand cycles toward Galactic West and Up.

01:29 Blake Madison says into the PA microphone, "Ok."

01:30 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

01:30 Clarina Taylor says, "I think Keegan said we shoudl likely recharge and stock up on fuels."

01:30 Clarina Taylor says, "If we found one of these, or a protosystem."

01:30 Lily Kaise says, "Well we don't need to recharge yet."

01:30 Lily Kaise says, "But if there's room in the hold, would be nice to get some of this debris."

01:32 Clarina Taylor says, "I'm not sure. It's what he said earlier."

01:32 Ryan Thomas roams in from the north.

01:32 Ryan Thomas stretches.

01:33 Clarina Taylor says, "Hey, Ryan."

01:33 Ryan Thomas says, "Pre-stellar object."

01:33 Ryan Thomas says, "Hey."

02:02 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

02:02 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

02:02 A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startlingly like a single unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:02 Blake Madison scrambles to his feet.

02:02 Blake Madison walks north.

02:02 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

02:02 Clarina Taylor wanders in followed by Ryan Thomas.

02:06 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

02:06 The computer announces, "McHugh Aeronautics Soft Impact Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

02:07 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

02:08 Gonzales Bourne sprints in.

02:08 Gonzales Bourne sprints north.

02:11 The computer announces, "Complete data from McHugh Aeronautics Soft Impact Probe on close approach received."

02:12 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

02:13 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:13 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:13 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:13 The starship has left a unique area of space.

02:13 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

02:13 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

02:14 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

02:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:15 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:17 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

A riftstorm appears to be 2.06 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic South and Up.

02:42 Blake Madison says, "Another storm."

02:42 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh."

02:43 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

02:43 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

03:10 Lily Kaise nods and smiles.

03:13 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

03:15 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

03:15 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

03:18 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

03:18 Alko Delovega suddenly awakens.

03:18 Lily Kaise waves to Alko Delovega.

03:18 Alko Delovega waves.

03:18 Alko Delovega says, "Morning."

03:18 Alko Delovega stretches.

03:18 Lily says to Alko, "Morning!"

03:19 Alko Delovega asks, "Are we entering a storm?"

03:19 Alko Delovega switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

03:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:21 Alko Delovega switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

03:22 Alko Delovega presses a button on the side of a message board reader, and it chirps quietly.

03:22 Alko Delovega schlepps north.

03:23 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

03:28 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

03:29 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Staying up in the control room until we hit the storm."

03:29 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gonna try to figure out a 'more or less where we want to go' heading and hope it's not pushing us back down towards home."

03:31 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

03:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:39 Hawthorn Dunn navigates his slate blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

03:42 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

03:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:51 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I've been watching!"

03:52 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's different between this storm and the other one I posted about?"

03:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "This one's just a bog-standard riftstorm."

03:52 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What was so bad about the other?"

03:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Astable storms make even less sense than normal, if I recall."

03:52 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh."

03:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, all rift storms damage the drive faster."

03:52 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Those are just weird."

03:52 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:53 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We've gone slightly less distance than I'd like, so we're smacking in to this one."

03:53 You say to Lily, "I'm going to go head to bed."

03:53 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:53 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:53 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:53 You stand up from an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

03:53 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

03:53 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

03:53 Lily says to you, "Ok i'll be in shortly. I'd like to checkout this storm for a little bit."

03:53 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The charge isn't bad at least."

04:17 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

04:17 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

04:17 The sails billow as the wind howls.

04:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:49 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Trying to catch it a bit more."

04:56 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

04:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:19 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

05:19 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

05:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:22 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

07:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:39 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo."

07:39 Matteo Hapta's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi."

07:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:21 Two skeletons riding skeletal horses draw alongside the hovertruck bed briefly and stare across at you, blue points of light glittering in their empty eyesockets.

08:23 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

08:24 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

08:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

08:37 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey."

08:38 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sup."

08:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:54 There is a momentary pause from the gunfire and then the shooting resumes.

09:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:04 The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.

09:14 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

09:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:25 An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left leg is soaked in blood.

09:25 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

09:25 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

09:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

09:55 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

09:59 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

10:09 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

10:20 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

10:26 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

10:27 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

10:45 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

10:50 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gosh I still have to work on these holo films ugh."

10:57 Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other, tortured bodies straining with the effort.

11:02 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hawthorn, you said two hours?"

11:07 On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls from the sky.

11:14 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That or so. Yeah."

11:14 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I will try not to over sleep."

11:17 The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.

11:28 The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.

11:28 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

11:29 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

11:39 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

11:58 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

12:02 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

12:02 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

12:02 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:03 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repair time. Who's awake?"

12:03 Tony Cross's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am awake."

12:03 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

14:53 Clarina Taylor says, "I fogot how little she was."

14:54 Ryan Thomas says, "Who."

15:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:14 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

15:14 Clarina Taylor asks, "Aye, but we wanna find new things, right?"

15:15 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

15:55 Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and mangled stump where his right arm once was.

15:56 Enemy gunfire erupts at the far end of the trench, and a group of soldiers rush over to defend the area.

15:56 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

15:57 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

16:13 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

16:15 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

16:16 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

16:31 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

16:31 Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

16:31 Ryan Thomas scrambles to his feet.

16:31 Ryan Thomas roams north.

16:33 Tony Cross walks in.

16:33 Tony Cross walks north.

16:33 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

16:33 The computer announces, "McHugh Aeronautics Soft Impact Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

16:39 Simon Collins presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

16:39 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Guy! We've probed space and gotten results, very very responsive results! Hail to the probe!"

16:39 Matteo Hapta walks in from the north.

16:40 Matteo Hapta sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

16:41 Tony Cross presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

16:41 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

16:42 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

16:42 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

16:42 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

16:42 The starship has left a unique area of space.

16:42 Clarina Taylor says, "Vroom."

16:42 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

16:42 Dice roll, and the ship is advanced around a corner of the board.

16:42 Ryan Thomas says, "Why are we going up."

16:42 Ryan Thomas asks, "Do we know?"

16:42 Clarina Taylor says, "Flow."

16:43 You hear a card being slapped down. A moment later, the ship takes an abrupt shortcut to another square.

16:43 Simon Collins asks, "You must wonder, what game do they play?"

16:43 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

16:43 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

16:43 Gonzales Bourne sprints up.

16:43 Matteo Hapta scrambles to his feet.

16:46 Tony Cross navigates his plain flat einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:47 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

16:47 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Everyone's life is a game!"

16:47 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Apparently so!"

16:48 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Some people become kings, others remain pawns, while some go in between and become nights, bishops etc."

16:48 Blake Madison asks, "Don't we have a limited number of probes?"

16:49 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "That started out philosophical, and then lost it's punch at the end, but I'll save that for a book, or something or other."

16:49 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You're looking to the long person for philosophical!"

16:49 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well, they probed the field, I didn't do it. Might wanna save some for the planets."

16:49 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wrong, too."

16:49 Blake Madison nods. "That's what I thought as well."

16:49 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I just want to survive the game."

16:49 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "I was going to ask if you perceived yourself to be taller and beanpole in appearance."

16:50 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And maybe win too, winning is good."

16:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:50 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I would recommend that too but I don't know what Keegan instructed Gonzalez to do or not to do so i'm just staying out of da way!"

16:50 Lily Kaise grins.

16:50 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I, alas, am a pawn, just like the res tof you."

16:50 Ryan Thomas says, "There's always asking what keegan told gonzalez."

16:50 Ryan Thomas says, "Usually works."

16:50 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Embrace your pawn-esque life."

16:50 Clarina Taylor says, "He isn't here."

16:50 Hawthorn Dunn says, "For ather has done so."

16:51 Clarina Taylor laughs at Hawthorn Dunn.

16:51 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Queens have all the power anyway."

16:51 Ryan Thomas says, "And I'm willing to be we'll see him again before we get home. Or even turn around."

16:51 Lily Kaise gives Clarina Taylor a high five.

16:51 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:52 Clarina Taylor laughs at Ryan Thomas.

16:52 Clarina Taylor says, "Two different convos, man."

16:52 Ryan Thomas says, "OH."

16:52 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "So Gonzalez how many probes do we have available?"

16:52 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There are 72 probes remaining."

16:52 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Ah ok."

16:52 Alko Delovega suddenly awakens.

16:53 Ryan Thomas says, "Right. Conversation 1: ask keegan and or gonzalez when they awaken. Conversation 2: queens do have all the power."

16:53 Ryan Thomas grins at Hawthorn Dunn.

16:53 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I had some on my Sightseer not sure if those incorporated but I don't mind if they were and if they're used."

16:53 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We would be able to use those probes, yes."

16:53 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And they would credit the entire crew on the platform."

16:54 Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Morning."

16:54 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Ah good as those are higher ones."

16:54 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Then we'll save them for rarer finds."

16:54 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yup."

16:54 Alko Delovega switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

16:54 Clarina Taylor says, "So in other words, we're good."

16:54 Ryan Thomas nods.

16:55 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah i'd say so as if we're only out for a couple oweeks, and find a few points of interest per day, we should be fine."

16:55 Ryan Thomas says, "Well, we can find 72 more."

16:55 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

16:56 Alko Delovega stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

16:56 Alko Delovega schlepps north.

16:56 Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "We're going to find approximately 5 objects per day every day all day. That'll really go through are probes!"

16:57 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh dear!"

16:57 Blake Madison says, "Imagine that payout."

16:57 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:57 Clarina Taylor says, "Here planet planet planet."

16:57 Blake says to Clarina, "Planets are not felo."

16:57 Blake Madison nods and nods.

16:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well these will likely pay very little for things like oorts, asteroid clusters and even fields of shipwrecks but planets and if we do find any star forations, those would be decent. We ave to get out of Local Space to find anything of much value."

16:58 Lily Kaise says, "Star formations that is."

16:59 Blake Madison says, "Well, plenty of time before we turn around."

16:59 Lily Kaise nods.

16:59 Clarina Taylor nods to Blake Madison.

16:59 Ryan Thomas says, "Also."

16:59 Ryan Thomas says, "Not paying much is what."

17:00 Blake Madison glances at Lily Kaise.

17:00 Lily Kaise says, "Nothing to a few hundred thousand."

17:00 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:00 Clarina Taylor says, "Any pay is better than no pay."

17:00 Ryan Thomas says, "Few hundred thousand more than I had before."

17:00 Blake Madison says, "Oh. Well that's...not exactly amazing."

17:00 Clarina Taylor says, "Nah."

17:00 Ryan Thomas asks, "Are we out here for the money?"

17:00 Clarina Taylor says, "We're nearly to the edge of the Earth chart or so the post says."

17:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

17:01 Clarina Taylor says, "Who knows what'll be out here."

17:01 Lily Kaise says, "True just have to consider time vs charge and if you spend a lot of time on the lower stuff, then you won't have as much time for discovering the better stuff."

17:01 Alko Delovega schlepps in from the north.

17:01 Blake Madison says, "I mean, fair point we're not. But...we're also not out here for only other things as well. Credits do factor into it I'd think."

17:01 Alko Delovega says, "Where is the docking bay of that ship."

17:01 Lily Kaise says, "What ship."

17:02 Alko Delovega asks, "That one?"

17:02 Clarina Taylor asks, "You mean this one?"

17:02 Alko Delovega says, "I mean where are the smalle ships."

17:02 Alko Delovega says, "Smaller."

17:02 Lily Kaise says, "There is no docking bay on a Platform."

17:02 Clarina Taylor says, "They are parrt of thise ship."

17:02 Ryan Thomas says, "They're attached."

17:02 Clarina Taylor says, "Part of this."

17:02 Lily Kaise says, "And none of those have a docking bay."

17:02 Alko Delovega asks, "How to check them?"

17:02 Alko Delovega nods to Lily Kaise.

17:03 Blake Madison asks, "Check them for what? Did you lose something?"

17:03 Alko Delovega asks, "I mean are we artifacting or something at some point?"

17:03 Blake Madison asks, "No?"

17:03 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Certain aspects are switched around when the Long-Range or other Sightseers are attached. The Control Room becomes a Weapon Room so you can no longer see the status."

17:03 Ryan Thomas shrugs.

17:03 Alko Delovega says, "Are we going to use smaller ships, or not."

17:03 Clarina Taylor says, "Actually, who knows."

17:03 Ryan Thomas says, "Probly not."

17:03 Ryan Thomas says, "Don't see a point to it."

17:04 Blake Madison says, "At least if we are, we wer enever told about it."

17:04 Clarina Taylor says, "The smaller ships are used to become part of the larger ship, in order to support more crew."

17:04 Blake Madison says, "Also none of us brought our own ships."

17:04 Ryan Thomas says, "I mean if we hit an artifact field, I'm sure we'll grab a few. Maybe."

17:04 Blake Madison asks, "We already past one didn't we?"

17:04 Alko Delovega says, "Aha."

17:04 Clarina Taylor says, "I don't think so."

17:04 Alko Delovega says, "Got your point."

17:04 Alko Delovega says, "A bit confused."

17:04 Alko Delovega says, "But now im good."

17:05 Lily Kaise says, "Well I brought mine but yes my Sightseer 'yeah the shipwrecks field would have had artifacts as they all do."

17:05 Lily Kaise says, "I brought my ship that is."

17:05 Clarina Taylor says, "Not exciting enough."

17:05 Clarina Taylor laughs.

17:05 Lily Kaise grins at Clarina Taylor.

17:09 Ryan Thomas's group roams north.

17:09 Ryan Thomas roams in from the north followed by Clarina Taylor.

17:09 Ryan Thomas disbands his group.

17:09 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

17:10 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "So all debris fields have debris but not all artifact places have artifacts?"

17:11 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Er."

17:11 Lily Kaise asks, "Huh?"

17:11 Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "All artifact places have artifacts but not all of them have debris!"

17:11 Lily Kaise says, "All shipwrecks fields have artifacts."

17:11 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

17:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

17:11 Clarina Taylor sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

17:12 Hawthorn says to Clarina Taylor, "Did you know that every shipwreck place has artifacts? Like every single one of them ever!"

17:12 Ryan Thomas sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

17:12 Clarina Taylor says, "It makes sense."

17:12 Lily Kaise asks, "Oorts and Asteroid Clusters don't have artifacts with the exception of Battle of Mir and the Fring one... Second Battle I think?"

17:12 Clarina Taylor says, "Things go boom."

17:12 Lily Kaise says, "The fringe one that is."

17:12 Clarina Taylor says, "Things get expelled."

17:12 A strange-looking starship approaches from behind, being lifted and placed by a giant hand one square at a time. It advances a few spaces beyond your ship and stops.

17:12 Simon Collins says, "I hope that thing is just part of the riftscape."

17:12 Clarina Taylor chuckles.

17:12 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Okay so for a moment I thought there was actually another ship in the rift chasing us in the flow. The hell."

17:13 Alko Delovega nods.

17:16 Clarina Taylor hiccups.

17:20 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Be right back."

17:21 Hawthorn Dunn ambles west.

17:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

17:22 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

17:33 A strange-looking starship approaches from behind, being lifted and placed by a giant hand one square at a time. It advances a few spaces beyond your ship and stops.

17:37 Ryan Thomas slumps on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch and goes to sleep.

17:38 [Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Observation Deck]

17:38 This room leads to the living quarters, and contains some additional amenities, notably a tiny alcove containing a shower. A small keypad controls access to the living quarters. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft cinnamon brown leather couch, an overstuffed aquamarine sofa, a small purple trash bin, and a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt here.
Ryan Thomas is sleeping on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.
Simon Collins and Matteo Hapta are sitting on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa. Tony Cross and Alko Delovega are standing here. Blake Madison, Lily Kaise, and Clarina Taylor are sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.
(You are sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.)

17:43 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

17:43 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

17:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

17:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

18:13 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

18:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

18:24 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

18:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

18:34 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

18:36 Matteo Hapta sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

18:44 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

18:45 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

18:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

18:46 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

18:46 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

18:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

19:08 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

19:08 Keegan Wantz yawns violently.

19:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:09 Matteo Hapta takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

19:10 Ryan Thomas suddenly awakens.

19:10 Ryan Thomas scrambles to his feet.

19:10 Ryan Thomas roams north.

19:10 Ryan Thomas roams in from the north.

19:16 You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship several spaces, moving it past an alien-looking starship gamepiece.

19:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:24 Keegan Wantz says, "Yo."

19:24 Ryan Thomas says, "Hey."

19:24 Matteo Hapta says, "Hi."

19:24 Lily says to Keegan, "Yo!"

19:24 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:24 Alko Delovega says, "Hay."

19:24 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Oh, you all are alive!"

19:24 Alko Delovega nods.

19:24 Lily Kaise pats a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria lightly.

19:24 Keegan says to Matteo, "Did you get to see how the approach worked?"

19:24 Keegan Wantz pokes and prods at a message board reader.

19:24 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah she is!"

19:25 Matteo says to Keegan, "Yes I did. It actually is very simple once you get the hang on the headings."

19:25 Keegan Wantz nods.

19:25 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Excellent!"

19:25 The ship lands on a square marked "Roll Again!" Dice roll, and the ship advances another few squares.

19:25 Keegan Wantz says, "Ohh I wonder."

19:25 Keegan Wantz strides north.

19:25 You hear a card being slapped down. A moment later, the ship takes an abrupt shortcut to another square.

19:26 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

19:26 Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Wow, now."

19:27 The ship lands on a square marked "Roll Again!" Dice roll, and the ship advances another few squares.

19:43 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

19:43 Keegan Wantz switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

19:43 Keegan Wantz says, "Was making sure the speed would pick back up."

19:43 Keegan Wantz stretches.

19:43 Lily Kaise stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

19:43 Lily Kaise glides north.

19:44 Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "Hope we find a planet or two!"

19:46 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

19:46 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

19:47 Hawthorn Dunn says, "That is one pissed off rift entity."

19:47 Ryan Thomas says, "Weeee."

19:48 Clarina Taylor says, "Sore loser."

19:48 Clarina Taylor grins at Hawthorn Dunn.

19:48 Clarina Taylor says, "That's what it is."

19:48 Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.

19:50 Keegan Wantz stretches.

19:50 Keegan Wantz says, "Speaking of sore losers."

19:50 Keegan Wantz removes a deck of Horrible People cards from a leather portfolio.

19:50 Keegan Wantz seems to be setting up a game of Horrible People.

19:50 Keegan Wantz finishes setting up his game of Horrible People. The winner needs six points!

19:51 Keegan Wantz says, "Because you're getting fifteen card hands."

19:51 Keegan Wantz shuffles the deck, then deals fifteen cards out to each player.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
22:50 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

22:50 [Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Observation Deck]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft cinnamon brown leather couch, an overstuffed aquamarine sofa, a small purple trash bin, and a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt here.
Blake Madison is sleeping on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch. Alko Delovega is sleeping on the floor. Tony Cross is sleeping on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.
Lily Kaise and Clarina Taylor are sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch. Simon Collins and Matteo Hapta are sitting on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa. Ryan Thomas is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

22:50 Lily Kaise kisses you.

22:51 You kiss Lily Kaise.

22:51 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Music? What?"

22:52 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "Gross!"

22:52 Ryan Thomas grins.

22:52 Clarina Taylor chortles at Ryan Thomas.

22:54 Clarina says to Ryan, "Pot. Kettle. Black."

22:55 Ryan Thomas

22:55 He appears to be 27 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has tan skin. His body is slightly muscled with average-shaped hips and strong calves. He has broad shoulders and a wide chest. His face is round and somewhat handsome, with a straight nose and strong chin. His lips are full and pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and widely-set. His short, thick hair is midnight black and neatly trimmed over the ears and parted on the side. He also has black stubble. He has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 He is wearing a black field jacket with a Fringe shoulder patch, a wristwatch with a slim black leather band, a pair of casually tailored dark blue jeans, and a pair of black combat boots. He is also wearing a black touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a black flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side, a black engineering tool case, a sleek steel flask with R.T. engraved on it in calligraphy, and a solid blue music tape carousel. His head, face, both eyes, neck, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying a small hot round chocolate cake with fudge icing in his right hand, and a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar in his left hand.

22:55 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm more a fan of Colin jonston. That Indie guy from Merida he's got some nifty tunes. All the bands from Centauri are kind of lame though."

22:55 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Indie's my thing too, really."

22:58 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

22:59 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Other stuff too though."

23:00 Clarina Taylor

23:00 She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has tan skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval, lightly-freckled, and lovely, with a button nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rose-pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and almond-shaped. Her ear-length, curly hair is auburn and in a chic and stylish pixie cut. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
A slender silver ring engraved with a row of tiny chainguns pierces her left earlobe and a slender silver ring engraved with a row of tiny chainguns pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a snug purple cotton tee, a slim silver ID bracelet with C.T. engraved on the front in a flowing script, a pair of faded blue jeans, and a pair of supple black flight boots. She is also wearing an elegant gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a sturdy black canvas Fringe backpack, a black silk handbag embroidered with brightly hued dragons, a silver touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, and a wrist-mounted chronometer. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, right wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

23:07 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in.

23:08 Hawthorn Dunn sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

23:09 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

23:11 Matteo Hapta exclaims, "I think I'll go to sleep. See you all in the morning!"

23:11 Clarina Taylor grins.

23:11 Matteo Hapta slumps on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa and goes to sleep.

23:11 Ryan Thomas says, "We will never see morning again, matteo."

23:29 Clarina Taylor

23:29 She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has tan skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval, lightly-freckled, and lovely, with a button nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rose-pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and almond-shaped. Her ear-length, curly hair is auburn and in a chic and stylish pixie cut. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails. She has a past injury on her right shoulder.
 She is wearing a blue cotton tank top, a slim silver ID bracelet with C.T. engraved on the front in a flowing script, a pair of gray cotton shorts, and a pair of strappy black leather sandals. She is also wearing an elegant gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a black silk handbag embroidered with brightly hued dragons, a silver touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, and a wrist-mounted chronometer. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, right wrist, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
