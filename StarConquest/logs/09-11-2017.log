It doesn't affect you but it does affect me so nothing for you to worry about. Still I was also in denial as others had told me how two-faced she is and I didn't believe them either but now that I've seen actions which speak for themselves and have our warehouse log to show, then there are certain aspects that one can't deny.

05:54:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You did tell her that she told you that I wouldn't be happy about what orgs were going to do to Lily. That is what I related to her so if she twisted that I wouldn't be surprised. Words phrased in that manner though seem as though she was gloating though but that's just one aspect of her behavior towards me which I am intolerant of. Anyway, I need to go now. Take care eli."

05:54:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, I read the letter, you told her I siad she was gleeful."

06:43:44 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

06:47:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:47:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

06:47:09 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

06:47:44 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against a dark purple leather captain's chair, purring softly.

06:48:19 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is shutting down.

06:48:44 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

06:50:52 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is now online!

06:50:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station in Olivia's Pearl Orbit.

06:52:44 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

06:52:48 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

06:52:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

06:52:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:53:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

06:53:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

06:53:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

06:53:13 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

06:53:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

06:53:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

06:53:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

06:53:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:53:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

06:53:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:53:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:53:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:53:36 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:53:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

06:53:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:53:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:53:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:53:41 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:53:44 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

06:53:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

06:53:46 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

06:53:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:54:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:54:20 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

06:54:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

06:54:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

06:54:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:54:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

06:54:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

06:54:41 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

06:54:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident lies down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

06:55:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

06:55:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you going to get that one, Eli?"

06:55:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If not I'll come get it on its way out."

07:02:44 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

07:03:44 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

07:04:45 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

07:08:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think I dozed off, sorry Constantine."

07:08:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't sweat it."

07:08:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm going to land real quick and see if that was even a merchant transport."

07:08:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It looked like one."

07:08:44 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

07:08:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never seen an EAOS one."

07:09:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right one. I saw some earlier today actually."

07:09:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

07:09:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hm, it's not at the pad. Maybe its journey concluded here."

07:09:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, must have. Strange place for an EAO transport to end up."

07:10:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Say, I was just thinking, you don't think there's a way to entice merchants to leave using a message beacon, do you?"

07:10:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like what if the message beacon asked them to leave for their own safety."

07:10:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't nkow. I mean we sorta tried that before. But it can't hurt."

07:10:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I don't think that will work, no. When we use the pregroamed transmissions it comes as a specific signal."

07:11:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. I figured."

07:11:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'm drinking at Cicero's in between scanner beeps."

07:11:44 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

07:18:44 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

07:19:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

07:23:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

07:23:45 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against your ankle, purring softly.

07:25:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll get it."

07:25:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Where was it?"

07:25:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Bikura."

07:27:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

07:27:45 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, purring softly.

07:29:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, Eli."

07:29:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It totally works."

07:29:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The question is, would that have any further-reaching implications."

07:29:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like would navy ships see that signal and jump out?"

07:31:45 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

07:31:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, so I tried packing the message into a larger one about not trading in our ports."

07:31:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which didn't work."

07:32:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So the message has to come on its own."

07:32:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe we could set up two beacons."

07:32:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually, punching that in as the text message might just be getting recognized as the standard signal and transmitted as such."

07:33:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So message beacons might not be capable of transmitting it."

07:33:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I wonder if there's a way they could be made to."

07:35:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ti's possible, though when I tried to type it out myself in the sector, it didn't seem to work."

07:35:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I just did it twice."

07:35:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe when Lily's around we can ask her if she'll test it on one of her beacons."

07:35:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

07:36:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah. I'd like it if she changed the Riverway one myself. It's kinda funny, but funny isn't really what we need."

07:40:45 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

07:43:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against a dark purple leather captain's chair, purring softly.

07:46:45 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

07:47:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

07:47:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is that creche fund closed off now?"

07:48:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I took it all and put it into a chip."

07:48:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The folks didn't trust that anyone could withdraw from it."

07:49:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. I'll send you some bread to add to it later."

07:49:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been meaning to contribute."

07:49:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not like I need my billions to buy cool ship upgrades."

07:50:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So I'm going to try and either just purchase a bunch of creches directly and send them off to medical centers across the worlds. Or if that's not a viable option, ew'll put it in an account that pays for people to use the existing creches."

07:50:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That sounds good."

07:50:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Using pilot money for things is tricky, but since it's a humanitarian donation I'm hoping it will be different."

07:51:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I hadn't thought of that."

07:51:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

07:52:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And.. well, we're usually supposed to go through the liaison office for stuff like that too, but I don't particularly trust the crooks currently running our government."

07:52:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So if I get in trouble, it'll be fine as long as the creches or otherwise paid for medical care gets to the people it needs to get to."

07:52:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't think of that either, but I think you're right not to trust them. They would probably just say they took the initiative to take something the pilots have been keeping to themselves."

07:53:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And i'm making sure that ti's on bhalf of civilian pilots."

07:53:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. on behalf."

07:54:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah I was actually just transferring a donation from Lexie, did you want to donate something? We're already got a butt ton more than I would have expected."

07:54:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure, give me a sec."

07:55:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

07:57:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that going to be enough? Do we have a rough idea of what this is going to cost?"

07:57:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, just getting as much as folks will give I guess and then using it to try and do something about the creche issue."

07:57:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Anything better than nothing."

07:58:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And they'll need those creches if the Outsider's come knocking after we leave the Accord."

07:58:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You should use the terminal, and perhaps see if you can get a donation terminal set up that Voice can set donation funds on."

07:59:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We have that one box, but maybe there's something better we can have. Something you can actually set up like a voting machine."

07:59:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

07:59:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Good idea."

07:59:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

08:02:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So here's a dumb question, how did you have the fund set up before? Did you just do it at the fund center ATM?"

08:03:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

08:05:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So if I'm understanding this right, the fund center terminal lets anyone open a fund, but the funds in question are accessible to anyone, for both donations and withdrawals?"

08:06:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can set it to alliance, private, or set it to certain people."

08:07:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay. So what functionality do I want to ask for in our special fund machine."

08:07:45 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

08:08:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I notice that the donation box fund is different from the funds I see at the fund center."

08:08:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So you are just thinking I should ask for a way to set anything I want to collect donations."

08:09:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."

08:09:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Just a machine that lets you set up a donation fund for whatever we need to donate for."

08:10:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, funds don't let you set people who can only deposit and not withdraw."

08:10:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Making the donation box special."

08:10:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I see now."

08:10:45 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

08:16:45 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

08:17:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh damn, I didn't realize the planetary surveyor was a farport upgrade."

08:17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think you can actually get it on the Torus now."

08:17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. I knew they sold probes at least."

08:17:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's good to know."

08:18:45 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

08:19:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Torus confirmed."

08:20:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."

08:20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's also some real great racks on the Torus."

08:20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking my plans to set up an exploration ship were basically ruined by the QSA thing."

08:20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Racks?"

08:20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like,  real big racks. Bigger than you can even believe."

08:21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They are a bit ruined to have some very useful things at the moment. But doing a bare bones expidition is just another way to say fuck you to Best."

08:22:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figure I won't be going very far, but no reason I can't use the tech available to go as far as I can."

08:23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I may be joining you soon enough... I have a cuople of mor eplans but after that well... It will have either had a big effect, or none at all."

08:24:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And at that point.. I don't know Constantine.. I might be through."

08:24:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I can discuss plans with you in a bit to see if you want to participate, but I doubt that you will, if I'm being honest."

08:25:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'd like to hear them all the same."

08:28:45 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

08:38:48 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

08:47:48 You scramble to your feet.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

08:51:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

08:51:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

08:51:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

08:51:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

08:51:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

08:51:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

08:51:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

08:51:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:51:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

08:51:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

08:51:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

08:51:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

08:52:01 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

08:52:01 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

Ather jammoa,
You are certainly are assuming a lot. Eli asked me if I would be available at 20:00 on the 4th and I affirmed I would be. on the 4th at 20:00 and he did not call to organize nor did he anything additional and I was available and ready. Eli didn't notify us of his change of plan so that I could have at least let him know I wouldn't be available but for about an hour on the 5th and I wasn't available for but about a similar amount of time earlier this morning. I had asked Shule and Constantine to keep an eye on the Range office for the temporary stations we support. Shule, for personal reasons, isn't working much right now as am I not able to work but on a limited basis particularly during the weekdays and weekday evenings. I have no idea why Constantine didn't take care of his assigned duty as a Trustee for SEAS without properly notifying me. Otherwise, I would have made other arrangements to have someone else deploy the Beacon as it went offline while i was away. So on the 5th and earlier this morning, I couldn't be available. I will have some time around 22:30 this evening and will sho if I can come into work sooner.
So, this has nothing to do with a willingness to support our cause. I know that some would be just as angry if I didn't put up their Beacons and related but I made a commitment to Libertarians maintain certain stations. Johann has not been happy when i couldn't immediately deploy other stations at times so the pressure was coming from more than one direction Ather and not that I really wanted to spend the little time I had in the Rift. As I so would have rathr been there with you and Eli. So did you ask all of the others why they weren't there? Communications are key if you want to organize for a cause and especially this one so Eli or yourself were certainly not effective with letting us all know when to assemble and especially that the original time was postponed. Given my own limitations, I for one was very sad and disappointed that we did nothing on the 4th when this was originally planned. I have already been supportive through being on hand for Eli's public broadcasts when I could. I have personally chased off traders and supply ships and will continue to do so. I will also, as I said, be on hand for as often as I can to protest or otherwise.
I was hopeful that the trip out to 777 wouldn't require as much time as it did and I had to leave while the ship was in the Rift for most of the time so it was flying on its own and obviously at risk but it was the best I could do.
I'm sorry that you have been so judgemental. It's obviously true that you and Eli are indeed placing hostile pressure upon AEU pilots as well. Think about your behavior and your own actions Ather. Also, ask questions before you make assumptions of others. If you want others to be available, notice needs to be given or other arrangements whic
09:01:03 h were notified to us should follow through as well. For shyer pilots, you are likely intimmidating them and this is not the right time to behave in this manner as we need to work together but you are already causing hostility amongst us when we need to come together and be supportive of one another instead. So this is not a rant. It is merely an expression of my disappointment in you Ather Jammoa.
As for the revocation of other organizations to SEAS Warehouse, it's disappointing. However, I have such little time to be at work, that the responsibilities often don't afford me much time for anything else while I am able to be here and I am currently not seeing others stepping up to assist. After their respective modules are depleted, I will revoke other organizations access to SEAS Warehouse in kind. If they want assistance in the future and restore SEAS, then we will return their status.
This letter will be distributed to all Organization Founders.
Lily Kaise

17:01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Kim."

17:02:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Constantine."

17:02:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going?"

17:02:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, what can I say. I am back from my vacation and it seems we are on strike?"

17:02:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well..."

17:03:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, we're on strike, for whatever that means. I used to work a lot, now I'm not."

17:03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know how much some of the others used to work."

17:03:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And many aren't striking at all."

17:03:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The question is, are we effective... Other than the general mess the AEU is in thanks to our president, and no I don't mind if he hears it, I am ok I guess."

17:03:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I doubt we're effective."

17:03:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Hello? Anyone there?"

17:04:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I don't think it really matters if he hears us."

17:04:55 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

17:04:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It also seems there are quite a few people out of coms range, probably on that salvage op business."

17:05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

17:06:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think I may pay them a visit one of these days, not for work, just to chat."

17:06:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You may as well."

17:06:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I may as well what?"

17:06:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Pay them a visit."

17:06:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not a lot going on here anyway."

17:07:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, I hope, when you have some time we can catch up? I have read all the news and I still feel like I don't know much."

17:07:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey, sure."

17:07:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I have nothing but time."

17:07:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "All I do these days is try to stop merchants from trading in our ports."

17:07:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is not really a full time job."

17:08:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uhm, how do we do that?"

17:08:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I usually send a text-based transmission or two telling them that trading in Union ports gives Best the power to undermine the Accord, then I send a standard signal telling them to leave."

17:08:54 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

17:09:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, that sounds effective."

17:09:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That is, if they decide to agree."

17:09:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I actually just discovered that a text-based transmission telling them to leave for their own safety works just as well. So I'd like to experiment with setting a message beacon up to do it."

17:09:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "However, I wouldn't want such a beacon to divert navy ships."

17:10:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure if they respond to those transmissions."

17:10:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, that would be bad."

17:11:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not even sure this is even doing anything. A day or two after we started, there was a headline about trade being down 7%."

17:11:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We've heard nothing since."

17:13:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What did you do with your belt personell? Are they still working for you? Or didn't you have any to begin with?"

17:14:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've done nothing with mine yet. Some are still paying them, I think. As long as you don't collect points you don't contribute anything, I believe. But confirm that with Eli."

17:14:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want to stick to the strike rules, that is."

17:15:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Unfortunately I collected a few weeks back while I was here for a day, not realizing the strike. I will not do that again though."

17:15:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah."

17:15:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, no worries."

17:16:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do not believe belt points make a big impact or help our economy much. A load of salvage would be much more useful to our government than that, I would think."

17:16:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's probably true, we're just been trying to completely shut things down."

17:16:55 A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

17:17:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course we haven't come close."

17:17:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yep. I understand."

17:18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The strike has been on for a month today, actually."

17:19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Whoever came up with the idea of those temp stations, I do like that."

17:19:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli and I built the first three a long time ago."

17:19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We let them sunset without replacing them because we didn't feel they were doing much."

17:19:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also feel like we were discouraged from doing it by a few people."

17:19:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily has set these up."

17:20:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I get it. Well, maybe we should build so many they get a bit harder to ignore."

17:20:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, originally we set up one in each hub sector."

17:21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Providence, Riverways, and what not."

17:21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It might make more of a statement to have one in each planet sector."

17:21:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That gets pricey though."

17:21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least for me."

17:22:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, I can spare quite a few credits, and Starseekers certainly can."

17:22:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well I just confirmed that the navy doesn't care about the standard leave the sector transmission."

17:22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So when Lily wakes up I may ask her to experiment with one of those beacons to see if it can transmit one."

17:22:55 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

17:22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I could do one now."

17:23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, you also got a capsule?"

17:23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I use it mostly to move quickly to the bubble."

17:24:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No more capsules for us, though. Now that we've lost QSA access we can't buy anything at farport, I don't think."

17:24:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, yeah, I never did that, because leaving ships there never seemed like an idea I'd like."

17:24:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's not the most ideal solution, but it does save me time. Before the strike I was going out there every day."

17:24:55 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior pulsates gently.

17:25:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Losing QSA access is bad on more fronts, what do you think about GMG? A ton of exploration upgrades?"

17:25:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, losing that stuff is a serious blow."

17:25:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't been to GMG yet and now I don't know when or if I ever will."

17:26:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wanted to lead an expedition next term, and I will, but my range will be limited."

17:26:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "In the wake of the negotiation meeting, I collected statements from all the pilots that were involved."

17:26:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Including the Mutuality pilots."

17:26:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We're not getting access back any time soon, basically."

17:26:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Why did it fail?"

17:27:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The Negosiation?"

17:27:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it failed for a few reasons. We basically had nothing to offer them."

17:27:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think what they really wanted as an offer was an assurance that our navy wouldn't use the QSA to attack them."

17:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which we don't really have the authority to offer."

17:32:55 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

17:33:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool!"

17:33:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What is, my constructor?"

17:33:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I thought it was a beacon at first."

17:33:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

17:33:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.

17:33:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is not really mine, but Starseekers's."

17:36:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man, if this works."

17:36:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be so great."

17:41:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Proof I have not done this in a while."

17:41:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

17:41:32 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon at New Earth Orbit is now online!

17:42:55 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

17:52:55 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

17:59:55 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

18:03:55 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

18:04:55 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

18:04:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "No one is doing anything? Someone must have an idea!"

18:11:55 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo jumps down from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap.

18:14:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay, he went to Hoyt. The beacon wouldn't have transmitted when he launched, right?"

18:14:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No."

18:14:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So we have to just hope he comes back to New Earth orbit. He'll probably go to Endymion though."

18:14:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I should set one up in Endymion orbit to test."

18:14:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, let's see where he goes."

18:14:55 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

18:15:55 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

18:19:55 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

18:24:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to grab my clipper?"

18:25:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Not very effective though."

18:25:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What's not?"

18:25:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "A Clipper."

18:25:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh sure it would be. Why not?"

18:26:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Rats do a lot of damage and it has no one in engineering with 1 gunning and 1 flying."

18:26:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well want to use one of your ships? I don't have any 2-person ships."

18:30:55 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

18:33:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

18:34:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, got a full repair, should just take a few seconds."

18:34:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We might inadvertently suggest that wea will make this sector unsafe for, everyone."

18:35:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And thanks for the repair."

18:35:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true. I thought if it does work, we might set up two message beacons -- one to say why we don't want trading, and one to say to leave."

18:35:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But we can run this idea by the others."

18:35:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I just wanted to test it."

18:35:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It probably won't work."

18:36:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is too general that way, not very specificly targeted, if you ask me. But yeah, we will discuss it."

18:39:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

18:44:55 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

18:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So why did Morris quit Seekers?"

18:47:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, because he wanted to try running an org himself, or so he said."

18:48:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that makes sense."

18:48:07 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon at Hoyt Orbit is now online!

18:49:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

18:52:55 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

18:57:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it doesn't work."

18:57:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, well, then you can change it into a protest sentence, so many get to hear and see it."

18:57:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

18:58:57 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

19:02:57 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

19:04:56 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

19:06:57 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we're not even on the board! Let's do some piloting!"

19:11:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How's it going folks?"

19:11:30 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on League Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light corvette "Catchin' Flies With Vinegar".

19:11:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Eli!"

19:12:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli."

19:12:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I tried to divert a transport with a beacon and it didn't work."

19:12:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, it was wroth a shot."

19:13:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. worth."

19:13:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

19:13:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah. I still wonder if I could somehow rig it to output the right signal."

19:13:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll look into it."

19:13:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

19:13:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I honestly think being there with a ship is much more convincing,, and hi Shule."

19:14:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It is more convincing to the merchant, sure, but a beacon always doing it would be so much harder for Best to ignore."

19:14:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh we both agree with that Kim. This was just supposed to be for for ones that slip by us."

19:14:09 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

19:14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Imagine if Best was sitting there knowing that no trade will get through."

19:14:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Regardless of how many of us are sleeping."

19:14:29 You scramble to your feet.

19:14:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:14:30 You exit the ship.

19:14:30 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

19:14:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

19:14:33 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:14:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:14:34 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

19:14:35 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:14:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:14:36 I don't understand that.

19:14:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:14:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:14:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:14:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:15:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:15:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:15:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm just trying to think of ways to get them to the table."

19:15:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:15:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:15:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:15:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:15:10 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:15:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

19:15:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:15:13 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

19:15:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:15:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:15:15 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:15:18 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

19:15:19 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

19:15:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least if we had the ability to end all trade they would have to interact with us in some way."

19:15:23 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

19:15:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Instead of ingore us."

19:15:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ignore."

19:15:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone coughs.

19:15:44 There are no other ships in the sector.

19:15:46 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

19:15:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm beginning to think they aren't going to come to the table no matter what, and something is very, very wrong about that."

19:16:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I agree."

19:16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, agreed."

19:16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Agreed."

19:16:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's like their on a kamikaze run for Outccord."

19:17:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And yet there's still been no news of a replacement for van Dannikin."

19:17:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Why is he even bothering with this obvious sham of a negotiation?"

19:17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "While I was filling Kim in I realized we've been striking for a month today."

19:18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, has it been a month? Or should I say only a month? It feels like it's been forever."

19:18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah it does."

19:18:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "?It feels like longer than that."

19:19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure it hasn't been 100 months?"

19:19:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

19:20:55 There are no other ships in the sector.

19:22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think if we could travel back through time, it might have been better to have had Vernos threaten them with a strike first."

19:22:05 There are no other ships in the sector.

19:22:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hmmm, maybe."

19:22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they don't tell us anything because we do things without telling them anything."

19:22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Possibly, though the liaison ofice almost seemed to mock anything he said."

19:22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, the terminal log is sad."

19:23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And a little bit funny."

19:23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey snickers.

19:23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

19:23:50 You must be in space to send a general sector transmission.

19:23:52 The starship is already moving.

19:23:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We did, but we did it by blowing up the ships on live holovid."

19:23:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:24:03 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:24:05 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:40:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:40:35 Which sector did you mean?

23:40:35 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

23:40:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:40:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:40:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:40:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:40:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:40:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:40:43 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:40:44 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:40:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:40:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:40:48 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:40:51 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:41:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:41:26 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:41:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:41:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:41:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:41:47 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:41:56 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:49:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How about you?"

23:51:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Could be better, I've got a couple of more things I'm working on but I don't know what else we can do."

23:51:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I asked the liaison office this morning whether the government was putting any pressure on them to end the strike or the merchant blockade."

23:52:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Mostly out of curiosity, I expect them to say no or not respond at all."

23:52:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's a little scary to think about, but I really think at this point, it's a mad dash to Outcord for them."

23:53:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If that's the case, why haven't they named van Dannikin's replacement, though."

23:53:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or maybe they have and it hasn't been reported."

23:53:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe, or maybe they're holding out ot see if the strike will falter first."

23:54:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, it's possible that they have and e've just been shut out from anymore information."

23:54:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You think the two are related?"

23:55:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's possible. I just don't know. Ugh, my head hurts from trying to see all the possible angles."

23:56:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Everything has been oddly silent though, except for trying ot paint hte protest in a bad light."

23:56:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Unnervingly silent."
