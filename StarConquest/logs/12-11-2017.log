00:02 A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock rifle slung over his shoulder.

00:08 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

00:15 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

00:15 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

00:18 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

00:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys stands up from a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

00:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves south.

00:41 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

00:51 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

01:01 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

01:05 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

01:15 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

01:16 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

01:16 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

01:30 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

01:46 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

01:50 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nissi, that's the most words I've ever heard you string together, I am moved."

01:50 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'll move your face."

01:50 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she whistles.

01:56 The curtains of silken webbing billow outwards as if blown in a wind that can't be felt.

01:57 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

02:03 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If you're lucky."

02:04 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Keep the plasma bomb, ghost man, cherish it while it's still maybe under your pants."

02:04 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "In some dimension, I'm sitting in it anyhow. And that's what matters."

02:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Indeed so."

02:05 Shule Elemmire frowns in confusion at the PA speaker.

02:06 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "What the is going on up there got any of that to share?"

02:07 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The rift ghost wouldn't let me sit on the plasma bomb and Nissi wants to move my face."

02:07 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Haha I see!"

02:07 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

02:08 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "The naoooooooo!"

02:08 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

02:08 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:08 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:08 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:08 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sorry Damien."

02:09 Damien Alexander tramps in from the south.

02:09 Lily says to you, "I gave you a snack earlier so don't clober anyone."

02:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:09 Damien Alexander says to Lily, "Mind if I grab a glass from yer decanter?"

02:10 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

02:10  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

02:10 You are carrying a cool glass of bubbly golden tea in your right hand, and a grilled egg roll in your left hand.

02:10 You take a bite of a grilled egg roll.

02:10 You take a bite of a grilled egg roll.

02:10 You take a bite of a grilled egg roll.

02:10 You take a bite of a grilled egg roll.

02:10 You finish off a grilled egg roll.

02:11 You can't drink a cup.

02:11  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks.

02:11 You take a sip of a cool glass of bubbly golden tea.

02:11 Damien Alexander sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

02:12 Damien Alexander rubs his eyes with the heels of his hands.

02:12 You wave to Damien Alexander.

02:12 Lily Kaise waves to Damien Alexander.

02:12 Damien Alexander says, "Heyas."

02:12 Damien says to Lily, "So do ya mind?"

02:13 Lily says to Damien, "Do I mind who?"

02:13 You say to Lily, "He wanted some wine."

02:13 Damien says to Lily, "I asked ya if ya minded if I grabbed a glass from yer decanter."

02:13 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh sure help yourself!"

02:13 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:13 Damien Alexander nods to Lily Kaise. "Thanks."

02:13 Damien Alexander examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

02:13 Damien Alexander helps himself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:14 Damien Alexander says, "I think I might also need some company, if I ain't intrudin'."

02:14 Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:14 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Naa this is a public room!"

02:14 Lily Kaise grins.

02:14 You grin at Damien Alexander.

02:15 You say to Damien, "None of us bite. Well, except me and that's only sometimes."

02:15 Damien Alexander says, "People keep tellin' me my girlfriend is datin' somebody else an' I can't seem ta get a straight story from anybody. An' it's kinda fucking with my head."

02:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:15 Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:15 You nod to Damien Alexander. "I'm sorry.That sucks."

02:16 You say to Damien, "I've been there done that. It's a tough place to be and rather uncomfortable."

02:16 Damien Alexander says, "Or rather, the stories I get don't jive. I ain't actually asked Eli yet. Can't get hold of him so far."

02:16 Damien Alexander nods to you.

02:18 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

02:19 Damien Alexander says, "If Eve wanted ta see somebody else, I'd hope she'd have the decency ta tell me about it. Or at least break up with me first. Not that that'd be ideal either, but the idea of her runnin' around behind my back, actin' all sunshine when she's with me? That's the worst."

02:19 Lily Kaise nods to Damien Alexander.

02:19 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

02:19 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

02:20 Shule reaches over and pats Damien on the back comfortingly.nod damien.

02:20 You say, OOCly, "Oops."

02:20 Lily Kaise says, "Well it seems you need to make a point to talk with her even if it's uncomfortable."

02:20 You nod to Damien Alexander.

02:20 Damien Alexander smiles at you.

02:20 Damien says to Lily, "Yeah, I have kinda talked with her about it... she says it ain't true. But if Eli says it's true, that's kinda a different animal."

02:21 You say, "If I was running around behind Lily's back, my piloting career would be over cause she would have killed me."

02:21 Lily Kaise says, "I honestly wondered because when we were out on the artifacting trip, she was uh kind of more than chummy with eli."

02:21 Damien smiles weakly at you and nods.

02:21 Damien says to Lily, "Er, just how chummy?"

02:22 Lily says to you, "Well I believe the same holds true for you too! It's just not the way to break off a relationship."

02:23 I don't see that here.

02:23 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I agree."

02:23 Damien Alexander says, "It sure ain't."

02:24 You say, "Trust, communication, respect and boundaries, the four pillars of a relatioonship. If you don't have one of those, your relationship will crumble."

02:24 Lily Kaise nods.

02:25 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:25 You say, "And that's honest and open communication."

02:25 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "There's really something out here!"

02:25 Damien Alexander asks, "She told me she wanted some space, before the artifacting trip. She barely talked ta me on the way back, which is part of why I stayed in my ship most of the time. I revoked most of her copies of my ship keys, an' when she got back she freaked out. Said she thought I'd given up on her or somethin'. I was just doing what I thought she wanted. Ta be apart from me. So she says she wants ta work on us, but needs time ta sort herself out or something. An' in the background she's messin' around with somebody else?"

02:25 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Nope, just yourimagination."

02:25 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Can we go get it, boss?"

02:26 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:26 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What?"

02:26 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nebula!"

02:26 You nod to Damien Alexander. "Not to be the negative one here, but that's never a good sign."

02:26 Lily Kaise says, "Well that sure has other messages then."

02:26 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If you want."

02:26 Lily Kaise says, "Right."

02:26 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yay!"

02:26 Damien Alexander nods.

02:27 Lily Kaise says, "Because when she was around eli and taking care of her fish in his sightseer and things, that sure didn't imply that she was sad about anything or needed space to herself."

02:27 Damien says to you, "It's the truth I want. Even if I don't like it."

02:27 You say to Damien, "And that's what everyone deserves."

02:28 Lily Kaise nods.

02:28 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

02:28 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

02:28 Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:28 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

02:28 You say, "It'd break my heart, but if Lily really wanted to mess around with other people, I'd at least want the truth."

02:29 Damien Alexander says, "I was thinking, maybe it's just a fling. Maybe she was upset with me fer... being a little jealous. She wanted somebody else ta pay attention to her or something. But it's sounding like she an' Eli have been a thing fer months."

02:29 Lily says to you, "Heh you know that's not going to happen first and second I don't have the time!"

02:29 Damien Alexander nods to you.

02:29 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:30 Lily says to Damien, "I do know too that Evenia had the hots for Shule too but he made it clear that that wasn't an option."

02:30 You nod.

02:30 Damien narrows his eyes. "When was that?"

02:30 You say, "I'm very happy with her."

02:31 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:31 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:31 You say to Damien, "For a while now..."

02:31 You blush.

02:32 Damien says to you, "She keep coming after ya after ya said no thanks?"

02:32 You say, "I mean, I don't mind if other people think Lily is cute, but they can look, not touch,."

02:32 You say to Damien, "She stopped."

02:32 You say, "It's kind of strained between Evenia and I now."

02:32 Damien Alexander nods.

02:33 You say, "And sorry if that sounds posessive."

02:33 You say, "I'm not trying to be."

02:34 Lily says to Damien, "So have you ever suspected anything between she and Johann as well? I'm honestly not trying to start anything but you knwo I already have trust issues with her. We're getting along and I'llt try to maintain that but she pretty much blew it there."

02:34 Damien Alexander shakes his head. "No, I agree with ya. I think maybe I got a little overboard, worrying that Eve was with other people... she said she felt trapped. There was a time I felt a little trapped too."

02:34 Damien says to Lily, "Never suspected that, no, but she told me people've tried ta talk like she was after Johann."

02:35 Lily Kaise says, "Well I'll be honest it seemed that way so I'm glad she was up front about that."

02:35 Damien says to Lily, "When was she doing somethin' that made ya think that? I'm trying ta put together some kinda picture here."

02:36 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

02:36 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

02:36 Damien Alexander says, "I need ta know what's really goin' on, an' I ain't gonna have a chance to have this out with Eve or Eli fer a couple days at least."

02:36 You say, "Oh they've been close for a while. They spend a lot of time together. Do beacons and such together... Stuff like that."

02:36 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "I'd say a few months ago now as I've been pretty much separated from a lot of people since I'm not at work as much these days."

02:36 You say, "I'm quiet at times, but I observe a lot."

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "So perhaps that wasn't really anything."

02:37 Damien Alexander says, "They're close friends, I know that. Johann's a decent guy. An' we're all in the same org together."

02:38 Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:38 You nod.

02:38 You say, "She spent as much time with Johann as... other guys..."

02:39 Damien Alexander says, "Just cause she's workin' with somebody don't mean she's dating 'em or fooling around or whatever."

02:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

02:39 You say, "I know."

02:40 You say, "But I've seen her land and stay on New Earth for hours and she's around... Not working."

02:40 You say, "Not in the lounge either."

02:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:41 You say, "But you could be right. It could be nothing."

02:41 You say, "But you deserve to know the truth."

02:41 You say, "Nobody deserves to live their life based on lies."

02:42 Damien Alexander says, "She told me she was working real close with Eli during the whole AEU rebellion thing or whatever you guys called it. The anti-Best stuff. You know. I was jealous of that, even if I shouldn'ta been. But I never tried ta stop her."

02:42 You nod to Damien Alexander.

02:42 You say, "That's true. She was."

02:43 Damien Alexander says, "If I didn't love her I wouldn't give a damn who she's doin' whatever with."

02:43 You say, "And she does like the AEU."

02:43 Damien stares into a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:43 You nod to Damien Alexander. "I know."

02:44 Damien Alexander says, "I'd like ta think that if she loved me, she'd be straight with me."

02:44 You say, "I agree."

02:45 Damien Alexander says, "It's gettin' to the point I dunno who to trust. At all. An' I can't work like that."

02:45 You nod to Damien Alexander. "That's understandable and not fair to you."

02:46 You say, "But honestly, she's not trying to get with me anymore. You can count me out."

02:46 Damien Alexander nods.

02:47 I don't understand that.

02:47 Try this instead:  dam

02:47 I don't understand that.

02:47 Try this instead:  dam

02:49 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

02:50 Damien Alexander asks, "I don't wanna shut the door on this, on me an' Eve, until I at least talk ta Eli. I mean, if he's the other guy, he'll know, right?"

02:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

02:51 You nod to Damien Alexander.

02:51 You say, "Good plan."

02:53 You say to Damien, "I know many of the pilots don't have much respect for me or Lily, but if you ever need to talk. I'm happy to lend an ear."

02:53 Damien Alexander says, "I mean, if Eve's been with somebody behind my back an' it's Eli, he ain't the bad guy in this scenario. Eve is."

02:53 You nod.

02:54 Lily Kaise says, "I agree. It's jsut not cool to be devious about it."

02:54 Lily Kaise says, "If I truly felt that Shule and I weren't going to work out, I would be honest with him."

02:54 Damien offers you a relieved and weary smile. "I appreciate that."

02:54 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I know you would be."

02:55 "Right, if there's a problem, ya talk about it." Damien Alexander nods to Lily Kaise. "Not look fer another option while acting like there's nothing goin' on."

02:55 Lily Kaise says, "Precisely."

02:55 You say, "Precisely."

02:55 Damien Alexander chuckles.

02:55 You say, "I mean, oops. Sorry to be the copy cat."

02:55 You ask, "Is there an echo in here?"

02:55 Lily Kaise says, "I also don't belive in string one along just in case if you know what I aemn."

02:55 You chuckle.

02:55 Lily Kaise says, "Belive that is."

02:55 Lily Kaise says, "Wow can't talk today I meant believe."

02:56 You say, "We know what you meant."

02:56 You grin.

02:56 Damien says to Lily, "That's what I'm figuring might be going on, an' that's more insultin'."

02:56 You nod.

02:56 Lily Kaise says, "It sure is."

02:56 Damien takes a deep breath and blows it out through his nose, shaking his head. "But I dunno any of it fer sure. Not yet."

02:56 Lily Kaise says, "Right."

02:56 You say, "True."

02:57 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

02:57 Lily Kaise says, "Again there is nothing wrong with friendships but I'll just say I was a bit taken aback by what I observed. It wasn't physical in front of us but it sure said a lot."

02:58 Damien Alexander finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:58 Lily Kaise says, "I think too, if Shule decided he had to spend a lot of time which didn't seem to be work-related with others, then that in and of itself is a huge red flag."

02:59 Damien Alexander nods. "Maybe less needing ta help somebody an' more doing it ta stay away from me."

02:59 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:59 Damien Alexander sighs.

02:59 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

02:59 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

02:59 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:00 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:00 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:00 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:00 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah unfortunately."

03:00 Damien Alexander says, "She went off ta get debris fer her platform's furnace with him too, just the day before this trip left."

03:00 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:00 Lily Kaise says, "Like why weren't you and she doing artifacting together out there? She was with eli."

03:00 "I just know how she tried to flirt with me." You frown. "At first it seemed innocent enough until..."

03:00 "She artifacted with him too?" Damien Alexander blinks at Lily Kaise.

03:00 Shule falls silent.

03:01 You nod to Damien Alexander.

03:01 Lily Kaise says, "Heh yeah that flashing incident really got me boiling."

03:01 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:01 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

03:01 Damien says to Lily, ""F-flashing?"

03:01 Shule nods slightly embarrassed.

03:01 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:01 You say to Damien, "She flashed me with out Lily there."

03:01 Damien's fingers close more tightly around a goblet.

03:02 Lily Kaise says, "That was clearly a huge flirtatious gesture if you ask me."

03:02 Shule covers his face with his hands in embarrassment.

03:02 Damien grinds out, "Yeah..."

03:02 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

03:02 Lily Kaise says, "I wasn't around too which makes it worse."

03:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

03:02 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:02 You say, "It would have been fine if Lily were there. I'd have watched Lily instead..."

03:02 You blush.

03:03 Lily Kaise says, "I wouldn't have liked it but I probalby would have laughed."

03:03 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

03:03 Lily Kaise exclaims, "But the fact that she made a point to target shule is jsut... wrong!"

03:03 Damien throws himself back against the couch, closing his eyes and making an indistinct, frustrated and angry growling sound.

03:04 You say, "Well, she didn't make it obvious. Others were around that flashed. She just told me later that..."

03:04 You frown.

03:04 Damien sits up. "Others? Where was this?"

03:04 You say to Damien, "I'm sorry..."

03:04 Lily Kaise says, "So when we had our falling out, Johann got on my case and demanded that I not call her promiscuous but that was not acceptable."

03:05 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't say anything else to Johann but I had my evidence with her flagrant gesture towards Shule as well as knowing she was after him."

03:05 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:05 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

03:05 Shule clears his throat softly then says, "Out at the place where we did those salvage ops... 277 or something like that?

03:05 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:06 Damien Alexander nods to you.

03:06 You say, "I thought... I thought that she was just having fun. I didn't know she was..."

03:07 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:07 Damien says to you, "Did she do somethin' else?"

03:07 You say, "I just throught she was joining in with the others."

03:07 Shule says softly, "No, just flashing."

03:08 Shule says quietly, "I honestly didn't know she did it for me."

03:08 Damien growls quietly, "Gettin' to the point I don't wanna bother chasin' down the rest of this story."

03:08 Lily says to Damien, "Let's put it this way, I may flash at NQ and on Pierre's ship or such but I would not target someone else's significant other."

03:08 You say to Damien, "I'm sorry."

03:09 Shule offers Lily a weak smile, "As long as I'm there... But that's not the point of all of this."

03:09 Damien Alexander nods to Lily Kaise and nods to you.

03:10 Lily Kaise says, "I know but then she'll have her cake and eat it too if you know what I mean."

03:10 You say to Damien, "Please don't hate me. I honestly didn't know."

03:10 Lily Kaise says, "On the other hand, if we're all wrong, then you can at least get to the bottom of it."

03:10 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:11 You say, "I hope sincerely that we're all wrong."

03:11 Damien says to Lily, "Ya mean if I break up with her she'll be free ta do whatever? I don't want her if this is what she's been doin'. But I'll be damned if I ever associate with her again."

03:11 Damien says to you, "An' I don't hate ya."

03:12 Damien says to you, "Ya knew she was supposed ta be with me, but you can't control what she does. It's up ta her ta know how ta behave."

03:12 You nod.

03:12 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I sure wouldn't blame you. "I'm just saying if it truly is a very close friendship between those two, then ok. It's jsut her actions sure don't seem to show a lot of faithfulness but then that's her and I'm me. I'm very loyal to Shule."

03:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

03:13 Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

03:13 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:13 Shule nods solemnly.

03:13 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

03:14 Damien Alexander says, "Yeah, the whole flashing fer other people ain't somethin' we talked about, but that's cause I didn't know about it. In a group, like just general silliness like at Mardi Gras, I guess I gotta let that go. I've done stuff that'd be a big problem in a relationship if it was anything other than just playin' around."

03:14 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

03:14 You say, "I know that some people thought I was cheating on Lily with someone while Lily was on that trip to Feng Wo, but honestly, I was just trying to help a new pilot learn how to fly. Nothing happened."

03:15 Lily says to you, "Yeah you're our SDC."

03:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:15 Damien Alexander says, "Some people seem eager ta leap ta that conclusion."

03:15 You say, "And I gave her some credits to reimburse her because her ship blew up, but that's all I did. I swear."

03:15 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

03:15 You say to Lily, "She wasn't AEU."

03:16 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh who was it?"

03:16 Damien Alexander says, "I didn't hear anything about that. But then I don't hang around with people who gossip, mostly."

03:16 You say, "It was Lexie, but she wanted someone who could help her learn how to fly and I guess I can do a bit of that."

03:16 Lily Kaise nods.

03:16 Damien Alexander smiles. "Lex is cool. She's a friend of mine."

03:17 You nod.

03:17 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Kani says we'll be there in six months."

03:17 You say, "I like flying and I don't mind helping people learn how to. I'm not the best flyer, but I can hold my own."

03:17 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Oh Thanks for the update!"

03:17 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Only six months? I was hoping longer."

03:18 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're going to half rations."

03:18 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yeah I'm never eager to go back into Comms Range."

03:18 Damien Alexander says, "Been meanin' ta talk with her about this latest update about Eve, actually. She's pretty level-headed. Helps keep me from flyin' off the handle."

03:18 You nod to Damien Alexander.

03:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yep she seems to be."

03:18 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

03:18 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

03:18 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

03:18 A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:18 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Maybe we should go to quarter rations?"

03:19 Damien Alexander says, "Cause I first heard it from Mel an' Morris an' Erik. An' today Nissi mentions somethin' about when Eve an' Eli started dating..."

03:19 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Well I think the vending machines were well-stocked?"

03:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:19 The computer begins an optical spectography program.

03:19 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

03:19 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:19 The computer announces, "CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe deployed to local area of interest on close approach."

03:19 You say to Damien, "Ouch, that's not the way to find out."

03:20 Damien says to you, "Right? She said she'd forgotten I was in the room."

03:20 Damien Alexander shrugs.

03:20 You exclaim, "Wow!"

03:20 You exclaim, "I don't even know how to respnd to that. That sucks!"

03:20 You say, "Respond."

03:20 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:20 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

03:21 Lily Kaise says, "Wellthat is just..."

03:21 You say, "I know. I have no words."

03:21 Damien Alexander says, "I heard it from Mel an' them first though."

03:21 Lily Kaise nods.

03:21 You nod.

03:21 Damien Alexander says, "But me an' Eve talked about it, an' I thought things were gonna be okay. Then that, an' what you guys've told me..."

03:22 You frown. "Yeah."

03:22 Damien Alexander says, "Almost everybody seems ta have an Eve story. Which ain't exactly encouraging."

03:22 You nod to Damien Alexander.

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "I've always had very good intuition about people. I'm quiet about what I think most of the time because those who need to cover themselves yell the loudest but I'm not generally wrong."

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "I wish I were though."

03:22 You say to Lily, "And yet you dated me?"

03:22 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:23 Lily says to you, "Well unless there's something I don't know about you then yes you have me fooled!"

03:23 Lily Kaise laughs at you.

03:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:23 You say to Lily, "Nope, nothing to hide here."

03:24 Damien Alexander says, "When my last girlfriend basically stopped showin' up ta work, I had a hard time lettin' go, even when she said we should split because of that. But Eve helped me. She was a friend. An' then she was more than a friend. And now..."

03:24 Damien Alexander shrugs helplessly.

03:24 Lily Kaise nods.

03:24 The computer begins a radio spectrography program.

03:24 Damien Alexander frowns. "An' ya know? She, Eve, used ta get upset when I mentioned Pais, because she knew I still cared about her."

03:24 Shule nods understandingly.

03:25 Lily Kaise says, "Well I still remember that news clip awhile back too about Evenia... um being the most eligible bachaelorette and I was confused because I did think she was with you Damien."

03:25 The computer announces, "Complete data from CSC Full Suite Multifunction Probe on close approach received."

03:25 You nod. "I was too."

03:25 "I saw that too." Damien Alexander nods to Lily Kaise. "I chalked it up ta the news bein' weird or whatever. Maybe I shouldn't have."

03:25 Damien Alexander says, "They said we were the Fringe power couple too, though, right around that time."

03:25 Lily nods a bit sadly and sagely at the same time.

03:26 You say, "That's true. I remember that."

03:26 Damien Alexander says, "When we were just tellin' one of yer cadets or newer pilots they didn't have ta stop workin', on account of Eli said it was fine fer the new pilots ta keep going."

03:26 You nod.

03:29 You say, "I mean, it's one thing if the couple agrees. Then noone can really complain."

03:29 The computer begins a x-ray spectography program.

03:29 Damien Alexander nods to you.

03:29 Damien Alexander says, "But I most definitely did not."

03:30 You nod to Damien Alexander. "And therefore, it's not right."

03:30 Damien Alexander says, "When I first came into the corps I was used ta being with more than one girl at a time. I told Elira this when we started dating and she never liked it but went along with it. Eventually I found out the multiple thing wasn't really fer me any more. It's a hell of a lot different up here than it was back home, runnin' with the punks."

03:31 Lily Kaise nods.

03:31 You chuckle. "Lily would kick my butt from New Earth clear to the other side of Feng Wo space if I suggested anything like that."

03:32 "Hold that thought!" Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:32 Damien Alexander smiles. "Well, I did lay it out there from day one."

03:32 Damien Alexander says, "I didn't date her fer six months and then go, oh, by the way."

03:32 You nod to Damien Alexander.

03:33 You say, "Exactly. Honesty from the beginning."

03:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:34 The computer has completed all available spectography and analysis.

03:35 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:35 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:35 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:35 The starship has left a unique area of space.

03:35 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And away we go!"

03:35 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yea."

03:35 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

03:35 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Good job."

03:35 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thank you for humoring my sense of wonder!"

03:35 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "So, another six months until the next stop?"

03:35 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup."

03:36 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Sweet!"

03:36 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

03:37 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

03:37 Kani Kahakai stalks in from the south.

03:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."

03:37 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

03:37 Damien Alexander waves.

03:37 Kani Kahakai says, "I left Pierre in charge. It seemed like a good idea."

03:38 You wave to Kani Kahakai.

03:38 Nissi says to Damien, "I'm not gonna keep after this with you if you don't wanna hear it, but if you want me to answer any questions or just tell you what I know, lemme know."

03:38 Nissi Valdaire says, "Pierre did declare himself captain. It's all on him."

03:38 Lily Kaise grins.

03:39 Lily Kaise nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:39 Damien says to Nissi, "I was just talkin' about it with Shule an' Lily here. I'm gettin' weary of the whole damn thing but I need ta know the truth, as much as it's possible ta know it."

03:40 Damien says to Nissi, "It's really startin' ta look like I'm the chump in the equation, an' that ain't where I wanna be fer all kindsa reasons."

03:40 Nissi Valdaire nods.

03:40 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Wanna go somewhere else and talk then?"

03:40 Lily Kaise smiles and waves to Kani Kahakai.

03:41 Damien sighs quietly and shrugs. "We can talk here. I already discussed it with Lily an' Shule an' I think almost everybody knows more'n I do anyhow."

03:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "All right."

03:42 Nissi Valdaire gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well. Lemme describe this first of all and I guess you can see if any of it rings true."

03:43 Damien Alexander nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "I'll cut out the speculation."

03:43 Damien Alexander puts a goblet in a small light blue trash can.

03:43 Damien Alexander examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

03:43 Kani Kahakai sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:43 Damien Alexander helps himself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

03:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "She and Eli got flirty on that trip we were on to find Aisling's people."

03:43 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

03:43 Kani Kahakai stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

03:43 Damien Alexander blinks. "That's goin' back a ways."

03:43 Kani Kahakai sits down on a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

03:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah."

03:44 You say to Kani, "We don't bite. Well, Lily doesn't but I do."

03:44 Damien Alexander asks, "When was that? May, June?"

03:44 Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

03:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "Not sure. Definitely several months ago."

03:44 Damien Alexander nods.

03:44 Shule sits back and listens quietly.

03:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "Melinda talked to him on her own I think near the end of the trip and found out they were pretty much together at that point and she told me. Cuz we had our own suspicions even then about what Evenia was up to and we were concerned."

03:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "So after the trip, I talked to him myself. Cuz he's been my friend for you know, years."

03:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:45 Damien mutters, "Sanity..."

03:45 Damien Alexander takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Reserve Pinot Noir.

03:45 Nissi Valdaire asks, "I was just like... so you and Eve are a thing now huh?"

03:46 Nissi Valdaire asks, "And he goes, yeah, was it that obvious?"

03:46 Lily Kaise blinks.

03:46 You blink.

03:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "But now here's the thing and I'm really curious if any of it is gonna sound familiar to you."

03:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "We weren't supposed to know. Nobody was. He really wasn't supposed to tell us."

03:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "She told him it was nobody's business, nobody needed to know, and she'd just be happier if it was all kinda kept on the down low."

03:47 Shule nods thoughtfully to himself.

03:47 Damien says to Nissi, "You got that from Elil."

03:47 Lily makes a discusted face.

03:47 Damien Alexander coughs. "Eli."

03:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Which Melinda can tell you she's said to past boyfriends too, like Corey."

03:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, straight from Eli."

03:48 Damien says to Nissi, "Yer tellin' me she dated Corey too?"

03:48 You nod to Nissi Valdaire.

03:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, way earlier."

03:48 You nod to Damien Alexander.

03:48 You say to Damien, "She did."

03:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "I wasn't around much for that, Melinda can give details though."

03:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "Or Shule apparently."

03:48 You say, "And me."

03:48 Nissi Valdaire grins.

03:48 Shule covers his face.

03:48 Damien Alexander says, "We been together since at least August of last year. Or so I understood."

03:48 Shule covers his face with his hands.

03:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "Jeez."

03:48 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Common Knowledge.

03:49 Damien clenches the hand that's not holding the goblet into a fist.

03:49 Nissi Valdaire says, "Eli and I talked... two or three times about all of this."

03:49 Nissi Valdaire says, "He'd get suspicious too about who she was spending time with."

03:49 Nissi Valdaire says, "You, Johann, even Vernos at one point."

03:49 Damien Alexander subsides into silence as his eyes grow large and round, and eventually glaze over. Time passes.

03:49 Damien Alexander asks, "Eli'll be interested ta know he ain't the only one either, huh?"

03:49 Shule nods solemnly.

03:49 Nissi Valdaire says, "Now I dunno the truth of her and anybody besides you and Eli."

03:50 Lily Kaise says, "Heh maybe he um..."

03:50 Nissi Valdaire says, "He would, but I think Eli has drunk the koolaid at this point."

03:50 Damien Alexander says, "So he'd think I was lying."

03:50 Nissi Valdaire says, "At some point or another she always gets these people isolated and then they start not only wanting to believe her but also lying for her."

03:51 Damien mumbles, "Isolated..."

03:51 Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:51 Kani Kahakai frowns.

03:51 You nod.

03:52 Shule starts to say something then stops.

03:52 Damien Alexander says, "I definitely been isolated. Some of it was my own idea. But Eve gets negative sometimes, basically disassociates with people, says shit about them, an' then I disassociate with 'em too."

03:52 Nissi says to Damien, "Now I told Eli back along when he had worries that he should go to you with all this."

03:52 Nissi Valdaire says, "Because I could see say Johann lying about being with her, but I really didn't think you would."

03:52 Damien Alexander says, "An' I ain't wanted ta believe the shit people been saying about her, but I've gotten similar stores from quite a few by this time."

03:52 Damien says to Nissi, "Johann? Really?"

03:52 Nissi Valdaire says, "But at some point I think he decided he preferred not to find out the truth."

03:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "Eli was pretty worried about Johann, yeah."

03:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "And they did spend a lot of time together for quite a while. But there's nothing but speculation there."

03:53 Elaine Moreau slinks in from the south.

03:53 Kani Kahakai smiles at Elaine Moreau.

03:53 Elaine Moreau sits down on a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

03:53 You wave to Elaine Moreau.

03:53 "Right, just cause somebody works with somebody else a lot don't mean there's anything more there." Damien Alexander nods to Nissi Valdaire. "There might be but that alone don't mean nothin'."

03:54 Elaine Moreau strokes the soft fur of Viviette the violet felo.

03:54 Viviette the violet felo purrs and rubs its head against Elaine's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

03:54 Lily Kaise waves to Elaine Moreau.

03:54 Nissi Valdaire says, "Right."

03:54 Melinda Michaels trudges in from the south.

03:54 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

03:54 Melinda Michaels waves.

03:54 Elaine Moreau puts down Viviette the violet felo.

03:54 Damien Alexander says, "I mean, I work with people too."

03:54 Damien Alexander waves to Elaine Moreau and waves to Melinda Michaels.

03:54 Melinda says to you, "So, six months. Have you got us a charge plan?"

03:54 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:54 You say, "Well, we all do and should."

03:54 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:54 You grin at Melinda Michaels. "Working on it."

03:54 Melinda Michaels gives you a thumbs up!

03:54 Lily says to Melinda, "Nissi has it in her pocket."

03:54 Lily Kaise grins.

03:55 Viviette the violet felo seems to be hungry.

03:55 Viviette the violet felo places its paw on a prominent bar on a felo nutrigel dispenser unit. It begins churning violently for several moments before producing a small glob of nutrigel.
Viviette the violet felo eats some of the nutrigel.

03:55 You chuckle.

03:55 Damien Alexander says, "I know I ain't been working with too many different people lately. I wanna change that."

03:55 Melinda says to Nissi, "A charger in your pocket? Kinky."

03:55 Damien says to Nissi, "But please go on."

03:55 Kani Kahakai strokes the soft fur of Viviette the violet felo.

03:55 Viviette the violet felo purrs and rubs its head against Kani's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

03:55 You chuckle at Melinda Michaels.

03:55 Elaine Moreau squints at Melinda Michaels.

03:55 Nissi Valdaire says, "But we do know we've got both you and Eli thinking you're in an exclusive relationship with the same person."

03:55 Nissi Valdaire says, "So... that's at least two."

03:55 You say, "That's... what... she... never mind."

03:55 Damien Alexander says, "That's enough ta get her in trouble in my book."

03:55 Lily Kaise nods to you.

03:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:56 Damien Alexander says, "I wanna know the truth, even if it hurts. Because if the person I care about an' trust the most has been fuckin' me over fer, months? I need ta know that."

03:56 Nissi Valdaire says, "I just don't want to see people getting lied to. That's kinda my thing. Do whatever, as long as it's honest."

03:56 You say to Damien, "She did the same thing with Corey."

03:56 Damien Alexander growls.

03:57 Damien says to Melinda, "I promise ya I won't hit yer walls. I won't promise ya I won't hit the walls in my Cipactli. That alright?"

03:57 You say, "Ok. I think I should shut up now. I've already said way too much."

03:57 Melinda says to Damien, "All I can tell you for certain is that a couple of us tried to get Eli to steer clear. I told him you were in the picture. For whatever reason, he isn't believing."

03:57 Damien says to you, "No, if you got information, real, honest information, I wanna know. I wanna know how deep this goes."

03:57 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't know much about the Corey thing. Only stuff I know about firsthand is with Eli and now you."

03:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, Eli doesn't believe."

03:58 Damien Alexander says, "I want people ta not lie to me. The rest I'll deal with."

03:58 You say to Damien, "She swore Corey to secrecy."

03:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "When I advised him to talk to you, he talked to her instead, and she reassured him somehow."

03:58 Lily Kaise shakes her head.

03:58 You say to Damien, "That's why very few people knew they were together."

03:58 Damien says to Nissi, "Same way she reassured me, probably."

03:58 Nissi says to Damien, "Probably."

03:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "I dunno how she does it honestly."

03:59 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I couldn't sleep at night."

03:59 You say, "Very... persuasively..."

03:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "Gaslighting and guilt trips I would guess."

03:59 Lily Kaise shrugs.

03:59 You nod to Nissi Valdaire. "That'snot far from the truth."

04:00 Damien Alexander says, "I'm a jealous guy. I ain't proud of it. But I told her I was upset cause she seems ta always have friends ta go hang with, her phone's always ringing, an' me, I got like two friends. I forget how she explained that away. Then she's tellin' me she feels trapped, wants some space, cause I was gettin' mad she was spending time with people other'n me. Like I barely saw her."

04:00 Damien Alexander says, "I revoked a few of her keys ta my ships an' she about lost her mind. So I gave a couple back, like an idiot."

04:00 You exclaim, "Well, this doesn't help you not be jealous. That's for sure!"

04:00 Lily Kaise nods.

04:00 Damien stares at his boots. "She made me believe she still loved me."

04:00 You say, "In fact, gives you more of a reason tobe. Especially with her."

04:01 You say, "To be."

04:01 You glance around at your surroundings.

04:01 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah... if you're the one who feels hurt yet you're also the one that ends up apologizing... that's usually not a good sign."

04:02 Melinda Michaels says, "I've been there."

04:02 Shule glances at Lily and Damien 'Can I... talk to both of you... Please?

04:02 Melinda Michaels says, "Not for the same reasons but I've been there."

04:02 Damien says to you, "Er, alright..."

04:03 Nissi says to Damien, "Anyway I say get you and Eli and a mediator in a room. Maybe with Eve too, maybe not, but definitely with a mediator who knows what's up with all of you firsthand."

04:03 Viviette the violet felo stares curiously up at Lily Kaise.

04:03 You say to Lily, "Please..?"

04:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "Doesn't have to be me. Maybe shouldn't be. Melinda might be better."

04:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "Or somebody."

04:03 Damien Alexander nods to Nissi Valdaire. "Mel suggested that earlier in the week."

04:03 Lily Kaise nods to you.

04:03 Melinda Michaels says, "My suggestion is talk to Eli, Nissi and I or just one of us."

04:03 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

04:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "Do that and I think the truth would come out. Maybe. Hopefully."

04:03 Damien Alexander asks, "You guys excuse me fer a minute?"

04:03 Damien Alexander stands up from a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

04:03 Nissi Valdaire nods.

04:03 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:03 Melinda Michaels nods.

04:03 You say, "I'm sorry. I need a privateword with them."

04:04 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

04:04 Melinda Michaels says, "It's fine."

04:04 You say, "I'm not trying to be rude here. Just trying to save dignity."

04:04 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that is what I suggested. Do not, absolutely do not sweep it under the rug because that is precisely what evenina wants."

04:04 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

04:04 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:04 Melinda Michaels nods to you. "It's all good."

04:04 You hold Damien Alexander's hand, taking him into your group.

04:04 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]

04:04 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small light blue trash can, a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it, a blue plastic table, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a felo nutrigel dispenser unit, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a dark metallic red cold beverage machine, a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and Viviette the violet felo here.
Nissi Valdaire is sitting on a large leather couch. Kani Kahakai and Elaine Moreau are sitting on a silky dark blue cushion. Lily Kaise, Damien Alexander, and Melinda Michaels are standing here.
You can go east, south, and west.

04:04 You say, "We'll be right back."

04:04 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Crew Quarters; Fore]

04:04 You can go north, east, south, west, and up.
Lily Kaise and Damien Alexander followed you.

04:05 You glance around at your surroundings.

04:05 You say, "I'm not sure where to go that would be private..."

04:05 Lily Kaise says to you, "Go into our room?"

04:05 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Crew Quarters; Mid]

04:05 You can go north, east, south, and west.
Lily Kaise and Damien Alexander followed you.
The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

04:05 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]

04:05 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise and Damien Alexander followed you.

04:05 Damien Alexander rests a hand on your shoulder.

04:05 You disband your group.

04:05 Lily Kaise moves to stand close beside Shule.

04:06 You say, "I... ummm. Evenia tried to go further than the flashing. She tried to get me to be one of her secret relationships. I refused. We didn't do aything..."

04:06 You sigh.

04:06 Lily Kaise says, "Well I suspected that all along Love."

04:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:06 You say, "That's why I know as much as I do."

04:06 Damien Alexander nods to you.

04:07 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:07 You say to Damien, "And she told me why she wanted space from you."

04:07 Damien says to you, "She did? What'd she say?"

04:08 You say, "She said... Well, she said that... You weren't affectionate enough for her. She wanted... intimacy and you refused. I'm just telling you what she said. I'm just the messenger."

04:09 You say, "I admitted that it was hard on me because Lily and I don't often have time for... umm affection and that's what she told me."

04:09 Damien Alexander says, "I never refused her that. I might not've been like that a lot with her, but I never flat out told her no."

04:09 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:09 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:10 Damien Alexander says, "She coulda... talked about that with me."

04:10 You say to Damien, "I believe you. I'm just saying what she said."

04:10 Lily Kaise nods.

04:10 I don't understand that.

04:10 Lily Kaise says, "That's jsut a flimsy excuse."

04:10 You nod to Damien Alexander. "And she should have."

04:10 Damien Alexander says, "Matter o'fact, I basically told her I realised I hadn't been that way much an' that I wanted ta rectify that. Ya know, be a better boyfriend."

04:10 Damien Alexander gestures vaguely.

04:10 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:10 You smile.

04:11 Damien frowns sadly. "Now it looks like that ain't gonna happen either."

04:11 You say, "We don't always have the time we want for quality time with our partners, but we still and always should communicate those concerns."

04:11 Damien Alexander nods to you.

04:11 Lily Kaise says, "Absolutely."

04:11 You say to Damien, "I just didn't want to have this discussion in front of everyone else."

04:11 Lily Kaise says, "As it is generally mutually frustrating particularly when life and circumstances get in the way."

04:11 Damien Alexander says, "I mighta been a bit distant, on that front. But she coulda talked about it."

04:12 You say, "I'm not like that. I love one person and only one."

04:12 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:12 You nod to Damien Alexander.

04:12 Damien Alexander nods to you. "Thanks, for the information an' the discretion."

04:12 Lily says to you, "Thank you for letting me know too as I suspected it went beyond the flashing incident."

04:13 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I'm sorry."

04:13 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:13 Damien Alexander says, "Sanity save us all from people who can't be straight with people."

04:13 I don't see that here.

04:13 Lily says to you, "It's ok I'm proud of you for handling it the way you did."

04:13 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:13 Damien Alexander says, "You guys're lucky ta have each other. Me, I got a serial fuckin' cheater, apparently."

04:14 "Yeah I am sorry damien but I read this in her a long time ago." Lily Kaise sighs. "I felt she was quite the manipulator."

04:14 "Yes, I am very lucky to have her." You nod to Damien Alexander. "I don't know what drug I fed her to convince her to open her heart to me, but she's the best!"

04:14 Lily Kaise blushes.

04:14 Damien nods sadly to Lily, then grins at you.

04:15 You say, "Anyways, any more questions for me? I'll share what I knoww to the best of my ability."

04:15 Lily Kaise says, "Ironically I feel that Eli deserves what he gets but on the other hand, I feel sorry for him."

04:15 Damien Alexander says, "In a way, I guess I was hoping the truth would shake out during this trip. I wasn't expectin' ta get as much info as I'm getting, but... the truth is what I want. I hate it, but there it is."

04:15 Lily Kaise nods to Damien Alexander.

04:15 You nod to Damien Alexander.

04:15 Lily says to Damien, "I'm so sorry."

04:15 I don't understand that.

04:15 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

04:16 Damien swallows a lump in his throat and nods to Lily, squinting his eyes shut.

04:16 You say to Damien, "So am I. I'm just glad I'm not one of those that has to come to you and say I'm in a secret relationship with her."

04:16 Lily Kaise pats Damien Alexander on the back.

04:16 Shule pats Damien on the back reassuringly.

04:16 Damien leans gently against Lily for a moment.

04:16 Lily Kaise hugs Damien Alexander.

04:16 You grin.

04:17 Damien gives your shoulder a squeeze, then returns Lily's hug.

04:17 Shule smiles understandingly at Damien.

04:17 Damien Alexander says, "I'm sorry if I been awful ya either of ya over Eve somehow. I don't remember if I was but if I was I apologise."

04:17 Damien Alexander says, "She's really good at this shit."

04:17 You say to Damien, "You were fine."

04:18 Lily Kaise says, "I guess to when I had my own falling out with her, a lot of my outrage too was over how I found her behavior so unacceptable and she was trying to exploit me as being the immature one."

04:18 You say, "I'm sorry I got in the middle of this. I know it's not really my business, but I hate to see people get lied too."

04:18 Lily Kaise says, "Oh me too."

04:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:18 Damien chuckles weakly. "My mind is fallin' apart at this point. I was lookin' for a couple bits of information an' I got a deluge."

04:18 Lily Kaise says, "I believe in transparency especially in a relationship."

04:19 You say to Damien, "UYeah, that sucks."

04:19 Damien Alexander says, "Thanks, both of ya."

04:19 Lily says to Damien, "Well you are welcome but it's not how I would prefer to share with someone."

04:20 You nod. "Same here."

04:20 Lily Kaise says, "I wish it were different."

04:20 You say, "Me too."

04:20 Damien's voice trembles slightly as he says, "So do I."

04:20 Lily says to Damien, "Get to know Lexie."

04:20 Lily Kaise grins.

04:21 You exclaim, "Yes, do! She's awesome!"

04:21 Damien takes a slow, deep breath, then lets it out.

04:21 Damien Alexander smiles. "Lex is great."

04:21 Lily Kaise grins.

04:21 You grin.

04:21 Damien Alexander says, "She's already a friend. Trouble is she's Eve's friend too."

04:21 You say to Damien, "Wish I had a punching bag for ya, but I don't."

04:21 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah same here."

04:22 "Thanks, guys." Damien Alexander chuckles. "The apartment has a gym with one, actually."

04:22 You ask, "Ok, we ready to go back out there or wdo we need a few moments still?"

04:22 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh yeaht hey do!"

04:22 You say, "Yeah, they do."

04:23 Damien Alexander says, "I'm ready ta go back."

04:23 Lily Kaise says, "In'also ther's stuff in the org gym."

04:23 You nod.

04:23 Lily Kaise says, "Also tehre is that is."

04:23 You say to Lily, "Ready to go back out there?"

04:23 Damien Alexander says, "Yeah, but I gotta go ta Old Earth fer that."

04:23 Lily Kaise nods.

04:23 You nod.

04:23 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Crew Quarters; Mid]

04:23 You see a Tardick lizard named Freyja here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

04:23 Lily Kaise glides in.

04:23 Damien Alexander tramps in.

04:23 You hold Damien Alexander's hand, taking him into your group.

04:23 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

04:23 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Crew Quarters; Fore]

04:23 You can go north, east, south, west, and up.
Damien Alexander and Lily Kaise followed you.

04:23 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small light blue trash can, a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it, a blue plastic table, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a felo nutrigel dispenser unit, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a dark metallic red cold beverage machine, a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, and a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.
Nissi Valdaire is sitting on a large leather couch. Kani Kahakai and Elaine Moreau are sitting on a silky dark blue cushion. Melinda Michaels is standing here.
You can go east, south, and west.
Damien Alexander and Lily Kaise followed you.

04:23 You disband your group.

04:23 Nissi Valdaire looks down at herself thoughtfully.

04:23 Damien Alexander sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

04:23 You sit down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:23 Kani Kahakai helps herself to a closed can of strawberry milk.

04:23 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:23 You sigh.

04:23 Kani Kahakai cracks open a can of strawberry milk with a loud pop.

04:24 Kani waves to the prodigals.

04:24 Damien Alexander says, "So it would seem my girlfriend, the person I trusted more'n anybody, has been lying ta me fer a very long time."

04:24 Shule nods sadly.

04:25 Lily Kaise nods in agreement and sadly.

04:25 Melinda walks over and gives Damien a hug. "I am sorry."

04:25 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:25 Damien Alexander hugs Melinda Michaels. "Thanks."

04:25 Damien Alexander asks, "Another thing?"

04:25 Shule takes a deep breath and sighs deeply.

04:25 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the south.

04:25 Kani Kahakai asks, "Should we go investigate the thing?"

04:25 You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

04:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

04:26 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Is too exciting for me, the opik."

04:26 Kani says to Damien, "Will investigating things help?"

04:26 Damien Alexander says, "It looks like it's right in our way."

04:26 Lily Kaise waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys. "Allo."

04:26 Damien says to Kani, "Investigating how?"

04:26 Kani Kahakai

04:26 She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has coppery skin. Her body is curvy with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has sloping shoulders and generous breasts. Her face is oval and girlish, with a broad nose and round chin. Her lips are generous and applied with wet strawberry lipstick, and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped, and enhanced with sheer orchid eyeshadow. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is dark chocolate brown and hanging in numerous braids. She has short painted frosted petal pink fingernails. She has a sprinkling of tiny gold stars in her hair.
 She is wearing a cream satin tank top, a mosaic star bracelet, a pair of stretchy black leggings with a multicolored star print, a chunky black leather belt with a double row of round antique silver studs and a big star-shaped buckle, and a pair of stompy black suede boots. She is also wearing a white flightbag with a gold flower on the side, a sky blue wrist-mounted chronometer, and some gleaming gold bangles. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, right wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a can of strawberry milk in her right hand.

04:26 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

04:26 Melinda says to Kani, "Usually we don't stop for debris fields but, have at it."

04:26 You say, "I think she means by investigating the point of interest."

04:26 Damien shudders and brushes at his arm.

04:26 Melinda says to Kani, "If you want."

04:26 Kani Kahakai says, "I don't know how all those fancy science doo-dad buttons work."

04:27 Lily Kaise grins.

04:27 Damien Alexander blinks. "Oh."

04:27 Damien says to Kani, "Sorry."

04:27 Nissi says to Damien, "Hey, sorry you've felt isolated. I know I had my part in that, sorry for that too. It's the last thing you needed for the past year, took me a while to figure that out."

04:27 Damien Alexander nods to Nissi Valdaire.

04:28 Melinda says to Damien, "I just wish I could have got you to believe me back when Nicolette was doing all that spider buying business. I suppose it was too fresh then and you just wanted to believe her."

04:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:28 Damien says to Melinda, "I remember you talkin' about Eve an' the spiders an' somethin'..."

04:29 Melinda says to Damien, "Yeah, it caused one of our arguments."

04:29 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

04:29 Damien says to Melinda, "Probably cause Eve told me somethin' else an' I believed her."

04:29 Melinda says to Damien, "I told her if she didn't stop playing with you and Nicolette both, one or both of us was going to jail."

04:29 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "If Anfisa was here, she would be unhappy about the sorrying."

04:30 Nissi Valdaire grins.

04:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "She would."

04:30 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

04:30 Lily Kaise says, "It just sucks and that's the nicest thing I can say."

04:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "Pretty much."

04:31 Damien says to Melinda, "It was about... yeah, somethin' about Eve leading Nicolette on... what was it about the spiders? I gave credits ta Eve fer a spider when she got it from Nicolette or something? I honestly can't remember any more."

04:31 Damien Alexander says, "Man, that was so long ago."

04:31 Melinda says to Damien, "Yeah, Nicolette got her a spider or two. I don't remember which. But she told you that she used your credits to get it."

04:31 Damien Alexander nods to Melinda Michaels.

04:31 You exclaim, "That was forever ago!"

04:32 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup it was."

04:32 Damien Alexander says, "Not long after she allegedly started dating me."

04:32 Damien Alexander shakes his head.

04:32 Melinda says to Damien, "Anyway, I think you and Eli need to talk. If you want somebody there, yeah I'd go with both Nissi and I or one of us. We've both discussed this with him."

04:33 Damien Alexander nods to Melinda Michaels. "I think Eve should not be there."

04:33 Melinda Michaels says, "I agree."

04:33 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah she'd do her twist magic."

04:33 Lily Kaise shrugs.

04:33 Melinda Michaels says, "I hear she convinced Corey to keep things secret. I hope she hasn't done that again."

04:33 Damien Alexander says, "Suppose it'd gimme a bit of closure, anyhow."

04:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah. My only worry is I don't know where Eli is at with this now."

04:34 You nod to Melinda Michaels. "She did."

04:34 Nissi Valdaire nods to Melinda Michaels.

04:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "At some point he decided he wasn't interested in the truth."

04:34 Lily Kaise says, "And I know shule won't like for me to say this but she tried it with Shule as well."

04:35 You nod to Lily Kaise. "It's ok."

04:35 You say, "I wanted Damien to hear it from me in private."

04:35 You say, "First."

04:35 Lily Kaise says, "The truth has to be known though and i'm proud of shule for being faithful and so grateful."

04:35 You say, "But now he knows."

04:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "Not surprising. The names I could list off could fill this ship. But again most of it is far from definite."

04:35 Lily Kaise nods to Nissi Valdaire.

04:36 Damien Alexander says, "All this secrecy... that just means I'm the one she's been runnin' around on. She never asked me ta keep things private. But she has asked me ta keep the PDA to a minimum, which I generally been okay with. Lately it's started ta feel like she don't want anybody ta know we're dating... which now makes a hell of a lotta sense."

04:36 You shrug. "No idea why she tried it with me."

04:36 A high-pitched whine fills your senses.

04:37 Kani Kahakai winces.

04:37 Damien squints at the high-pitched sound.

04:37 Damien Alexander says, "Hate that."

04:37 You nod to Damien Alexander. "She didn't want any of her significant others to know who was dating her."

04:37 Kani Kahakai says, "The rift disapproves of drama."

04:37 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh well I never trusted her for a moment!"

04:37 Kani rubs her temple discomfitedly.

04:37 Damien Alexander asks, "I don't want drama; I want truth. But it looks like I been dating the drama machine, don't it?"

04:37 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah."

04:38 Kani Kahakai smiles at Damien Alexander.

04:38 You pat Damien Alexander on the back.

04:38 Nissi Valdaire says, "I didn't trust her but I did think she'd ended the juggling and settled on Eli. So when Damien came back and said what he did, well..."

04:38 The curtains close, to no applause.

04:38 Elaine Moreau says, "People warned me of her and her 'secret partners' like my second day after my license."

04:38 Kani says to Damien, "You'll figure it out. People seem to want to help you figure it out."

04:38 Lily pats Damien on the back reassuringly.

04:38 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

04:38 You nod.

04:39 Damien Alexander says, "Rumours are funny things. I tend not ta trust 'em. Many of 'em seem ta just arise from thin air."

04:39 You say, "And with that, I think I'm going to go lie down and get ready to sleep. Rest well everyone when the time comes."

04:39 Melinda Michaels waves.

04:39 You wave.

04:39 Nissi Valdaire waves to you.

04:39 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:39 Damien Alexander waves to you. "Rest well."

04:39 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:39 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:39 Kani Kahakai waves to you.

04:39 Lily says to you, "I'll be in shortly."

04:39 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:39 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:39 Shule smiles tiredly.

04:54 A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

04:55 Shule Elemmire begins lying on his side on the bed, his arms folded across his chest and a tired look on his face.

05:08 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

05:08 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

05:08 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

05:09 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

05:16 You sigh.

05:17 You say, "Not very shortly."

05:17 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Be there in about six months!"

05:18 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But only very light months."

05:18 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

05:21 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

05:21 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

05:21 The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first point where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible. The star itself is merely a distant glinting point, indistinguishable from any of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar flotsam.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:21 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probe it."

05:22 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The short range one."

05:22 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

05:22 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

05:22 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "This one seems to have been previously discovered."

05:22 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup but not probed."

05:23 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I've done my part!"

05:23 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "For the record, we don't usually probe debris fields and stuff. I just am feeling generous."

05:23 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Luahg."

05:23 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

05:24 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh... well maybe someone will learn something. I hope."

05:25 Shule Elemmire begins lying on his side on the bed, his arms folded across his chest, looking sad and a deep frown etched on his face.

05:29 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's very dim."

05:29 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup so not much for stars there."

05:30 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well... off we go, since we're not probing for ghost planets amidst the rocks."

05:30 I don't understand that.

05:30 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:30 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:30 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:36 Lily Kaise asks, "Well you didn't say and I'm sorry but it's our last night with the crew here. So should I sleep somewhere else then?"

05:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:37 You say, "I went to bed early so we could have quality time together. Now I need to go tosleep."

05:37 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:43 You say to Lily, "I love you."

05:43 Lily says to you, "I'm sorry but don't you think that others have emotions to deal with as well? I mean you sort of dropped your own bomb there."

05:43 You say, "Yes, but my priority will always be to take care of you first."

05:43 You say, "That's just me."

05:44 You say, "Maybe I shouldn't look at it that way."

05:45 You say, "I was wrong. I shouldn't have gotten mad at you."

05:48 Lily says to you, "I love you too. Nite and rest well. Sweet dreams. We can certainly talk about it but I am sorry I am dealing with stuff too but I just thought you wanted to go to bed as you do this often so what was I to know. I really can't guess everything."

05:48 Lily Kaise says, "I'll be happy to talk about it later though."

05:48 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

05:48 You say to Lily, "No, don't worry about me. It's ok. I love you. Night."

05:49 You say to Lily, "Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:50 You say to Lily, "Don't forget you're still wearing Asteria."

05:52 You say to Lily, "Night."

05:53 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]

05:53 This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air, thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

06:30 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she groans.

06:31 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Weeeeennnnndyyyyy."

06:31 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

06:31 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

06:31 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh good, I wake uo and everything explodes. Go me."

06:33 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

06:36 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly out.

06:37 You say, "I can't sleep."

06:37 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:45 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

06:46 Wendy stretches out like a cat. "Man, I love being awake." That said, she falls asleep.

06:46 Wendy Arroyo blinks heavily and then dozes off.

06:46 Kani Kahakai leans toward Wendy Arroyo and gently strokes her hair.

06:49 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

06:50 Wendy Arroyo blinks.

06:51 You say, "That was quick."

06:51 Wendy Arroyo groans. "I was resting my eyes."

06:54 Wendy Arroyo says, "You become sesquipedalian when tired, why so."

06:54 Kani says to Wendy, "You stole my big word."

06:54 Wendy says to Kani, "I'll steal your big word."

06:58 Kani says to Elaine, "Yeah?"

06:58 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]

06:58 Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds.

07:18 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]

07:18 Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

07:19 You remove a silver plastic paper dispenser from a leather briefcase.

07:19 Use what?

07:19 You need a free hand for that.

07:19  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer.

07:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:32 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

07:32 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

07:37 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

07:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:34 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

08:36 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

08:36 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

08:37 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

09:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:38 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

09:39 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the west.

09:39 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

10:31 Small, bioluminescent alien insects flit above the grass, flashing bright purple hues.

10:40 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

10:40 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

10:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

10:43 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the west.

10:56 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

11:03 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders out.

11:10 A high-pitched whine fills your senses.

11:20 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

11:31 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

11:35 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

11:41 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

11:42 The curtains close, to no applause.

11:42 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

11:47 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

11:47 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I always forget to mess with that thing."

12:12 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

12:22 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

12:32 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

12:43 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

12:43 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

13:01 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

[Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Control Room]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a soft oval pale gray rug with a design of cream and sage green geometric waves, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and a metal container here.

15:27 The room grows a bit more chill.

15:30 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

15:30 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "A thing!"

15:38 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

15:46 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

15:46 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

15:47 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

15:48 Ali Candan presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

15:53 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

15:53 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

15:53 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

15:53 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

15:54 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

15:54 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Jib oughtta still be ok. Was just a bit ago I adjusted it."

16:21 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

16:55 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke.

16:55 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

17:25 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

17:29 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

17:39 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

17:39 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

17:39 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

18:48 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

18:48 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

18:49 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

18:49 Wendy Arroyo wanders in from the south.

19:44 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

19:49 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

19:49 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

20:02 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

20:19 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

20:26 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

20:36 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

20:39 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

20:40 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

20:50 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

20:51 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

20:51 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

20:52 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

20:52 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

20:53 The pathway tilts downwards abruptly, and you accelerate wildly.

21:21 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]

21:21 Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small light blue trash can, a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it, a blue plastic table, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a felo nutrigel dispenser unit, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a dark metallic red cold beverage machine, a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, and a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.

21:47 You snuggle up to Lily Kaise's shoulder.

21:47 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Living Quarters Four]

21:47 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

22:10 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:10 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:11 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

22:11 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

22:11 The oarsman relaxes briefly with a deep sigh.

22:25 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

22:26 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

22:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

22:30 The ship falls through a flimsy section of webbing, and you are suddenly freefalling with no sign of stopping.

23:51 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]

23:51 A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small light blue trash can, a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it, a blue plastic table, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a felo nutrigel dispenser unit, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a dark metallic red cold beverage machine, a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, and a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.

Damien Alexander is sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go east, south, and west.
