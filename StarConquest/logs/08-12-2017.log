00:31:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. I can't say his name right. But he decided to be rude to me on comms. I ignored him for the most part, but even I have my limits, so I snapped back."

00:32:01 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, ")h."

00:32:34 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I always give cadets a fair shot, but..."

00:39:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Before I take a nap, every station is up, including 285, and the bubble. The orion salvage station will go down in like 15 hours. I did the best I could to build all the things. Only thing that's down in orion is the weather station."

00:47:34 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "It is hard to imagine."

00:47:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There's like...one part on there, I swear. I had to raid and steal and scrape for parts from everywhere."

00:47:59 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Our methods were perhaps extreme, but extreme methods are needed to combat extreme situations. All you all pretty much know are the media spins, so it's unsurprising the way you're reacting. Eli can explain it if he wants to, I am personally just waiting at the moment."

00:48:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sounds kinda like y'all cut off your noses to spite your faces."

00:48:28 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I've no reaction minus that of you gotta do what ya gotta do."

00:49:25 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, remember what they say about assumptions and the first three letters of the word or some such! The media is doing a great job at it."

00:49:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So is the spaceport closed over there?"

00:49:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh oh. Felo. That reminds me. Morris. I found your elusive mean talking felo. I have been keeping them breeding on a little ship so that you could choose a kitten when you return."

00:49:58 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I have not tried to land at Hyperion due to the current situation in Jacktown."

00:50:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. Thank you Eve. If you're goin to bed, just holler at me when you're up."

00:50:33 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The spaceport should be far enough away to be mostly uneffected, that idiot sanctuary, too. Who can know, though?"

00:50:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm taking a nap for a bit but yeah. I will. Currently they're all adults. But I did it this way so you could pick a kitten. Rather than me just giving one tonic."

15:27:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:27:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:27:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:27:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:27:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:28:08 The ship is already moving.

15:28:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:28:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:28:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:28:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

15:28:13 Your ship 'William Dove' has been automatically moved into a garage.

15:28:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:28:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:28:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:28:17 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:28:18 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

15:28:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:28:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:28:22 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:28:25 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

15:28:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:28:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:28:47 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:28:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

15:28:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:29:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:29:08 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:29:12 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:29:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:29:13 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

15:29:14 You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:29:14 You exit the ship.
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.

15:29:42 You can't go that way.

15:29:43 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

15:29:43 [Starship "Effervescent Zephyr"; Engineering Room]

15:29:44 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go north.

20:10:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] voice cracking a little, Eli transmits, "I just hope all this madness is over soon, at least no one seems to have been killed..."

20:10:35 You exit the ship.

20:10:35 [The Torus; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.

20:10:40 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

20:10:40 You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

20:10:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:10:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:10:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:10:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:10:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:10:56 The ship is already moving.

20:10:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:10:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:10:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:10:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:11:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:11:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:11:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:11:05 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:11:06 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

20:11:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:11:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:11:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:11:10 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:11:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes that's the only good thing and I sure noone will succumb to their injuries. Not knowing what sort of bombs those were. Injuries from any bombs is always devistating."

20:12:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalina. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:12:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:12:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:05:46 You say, "Yeah, neither have I."

22:06:20 You say, "You still probably dislike her, seeing as she screwed up your marriage."

22:06:31 You sit down on a very soft quilted red sleeping mat with a large red quilt with an appliqued crimson and gold dragon design on it.

22:11:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think I'm supposed to remind someone of something, and I {an't remember what it is, so I'm hoping that was what it was."

22:11:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wonder how long I'm gonna stay awake."

22:11:15 You say, "Oh good."

22:11:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes, me."

22:11:31 You say, "Well, I should go. Talk to you later sexy."

22:11:34 I don't understand that.

22:11:36 Over the line, you hear Angel Martin say, "As for Takana, no I don't miss her, I don't really wish her well, but I don't waist my time dwelling on what she broke either."

22:11:36 You chuckle.

22:14:59 You say, "I know, me too."

22:15:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably Tandem station, though I'm honeslty not sure. Aisling will probably ask on general or something."

22:15:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I thought you would go."

22:15:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry, who's all going to meet with the council?"

22:15:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah we have about 3 and a half hours yet?"

22:15:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Me, um... Lily I think, and you? Or was it Eli?"

22:16:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, I'm not going. Aisling thi,ks it would be unwise for a rogue pilot to go."

22:16:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, all right."

22:16:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:17:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't know if this is a good idea. I'm just throwing it out there, but maybe use three should meet before we go over there so we can maybe figure out how to handle things?"

22:17:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Us three. That is."

22:17:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

22:17:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're probably gonna want something in return, not sure what you will be able to offer that the Union will actually back, but us trying is the point."

22:18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not sure what we could say that they would want personally."

22:18:11 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

22:18:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's probably a good idea Shule, and I've asked Aisling to talk to you three beforehand too."

22:18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, that's what?I figured. They'd porbably want something back in return."

22:18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes, but what are we willing to give? Honestly."

22:18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I mean, we can't really give anything but our word we won't fuck up in their space, and honestly, that's not saying much."

22:18:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're probably gonna want access to the Revo battery, I doubt the Union will back that though. Better chance of backing that then the jackrabbit though."

22:18:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Maybe we an braistorm ideas before Aisling meets with us."

22:19:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The revo battery is a good trade off, as long as we still have access to it."

22:19:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ather will not like it, but I don't like us not having access to the skism even more."

22:20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eh, probably not, but honestly I don't like not having access to the skims either."

22:21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "True. Also, if the mutuality is ever attacked on the other side of the skims, we would not be able to assist them with ships or anything."

22:21:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I doubt the aEU will budge on tech. I think about all we can assure them with is that we will purge the aEU Government to mandate that our navy is not to encroach upon their territories in such a configuration as a flotilla. That was extreme."

22:21:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Um wow."

22:21:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:22:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:22:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It sure was and that was extremely careless."

22:22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah."

22:22:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And if you are like me and just have your robot feed your fish and felo, it's fine if you don't go over to the skims, but what about those who feed their own felo with bags of chow."

22:22:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:22:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I use the chow from the trade center."

22:23:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You don't need a robot to use it. You can go to the repair center and order a feeding. Yes it costs but it can be done."

22:23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As do I."

22:24:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just do your ~est folks, it's very likely that no deal will be reached, but at least someone will have tried. The council seemed a bit insulted that hte government didn't even make an attempt."

22:24:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's true, Eli."

22:24:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wel, we'll try our best, but I don't know much of politics, for sure."

22:24:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:24:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "One thing we really can't focus a lot uponis our own selfish needs as they probalby won't hear them very well Yes we have lost a lot but we have to assure them of what we can do for them and not what we would want form them."

22:24:52 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

22:25:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

22:25:11 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:25:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know much about politics either. I've learned a lot in the last few weeks, but I'm still learning."

22:25:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I agree with Lily. I think we need to come up with something we can at least offer them. Some benefit."

22:25:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Agree."

22:25:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes, but what can we offer that they don't have?"

22:25:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:25:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I am likely the least political person but we have to do our best."

22:26:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah Lily, I am probably."

22:26:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I despisc politics."

22:26:35 You say, "Me too."

22:27:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "In this instance, we're needing to be more diplomatic and not political."

22:27:09 You nod.

22:27:17 You say, "I agree."

22:27:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't know if we can buy the chow anymore. I'm looking and I don't see it, Lily."

22:27:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:27:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's diplomacy we need to practice in this situation though."

22:27:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The defense thing might be something, as U*ion pi(ot corps ships have assisted in their defense before, but we'll see. Frankly, I'm surprised they still wanted to even meet after the flotilla thing~"

22:28:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If not, you should still be able to buy it at other ports Evangeline."

22:28:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:28:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I am certain that they want to know what our point of view is whether or not they believe it is one thing."

22:28:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."

22:29:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

22:29:10 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:29:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:29:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think whomever commanded that flotilla should be reassigned or demoted or relieved of his or her duties."

22:29:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wasn't there during the flutella thing, so I wouldn't know even if you asked me."

22:40:25 You can't read a secondary pilot command access unit.

22:40:31 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

22:40:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:40:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Whatever the case eli, we need to speak up and affirm to the 9th that we will urge that this was not an acceptable act and that we will urge that it is highly unacceptable for our Navy to take any future actions which may give the simblance of hostility towards the Mutuality."

22:40:44 You glance at your communicator's screen.

22:40:44 There are no notices.

22:40:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eva, coffee is your friend."

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

22:41:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh gods."

22:41:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

22:42:07 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

22:42:11 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "To be fair, Bailey wasn't really onboard in the first place."

22:42:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "Oh Goddess, really?" Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:42:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

22:42:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:42:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have no idea what that's all about. Strike? I wasn't even here until earlier today."

22:43:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wasn't either, but somehow... The people um.. blew up their transports while we were gone in a live broadcast to prove a point."

22:43:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances at you.

22:43:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What is that all about? I don't want to be accused of somehting like that."

22:45:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I believe he was in th emiddle of ,auling a roid when we told him about the strike."

22:46:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:46:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry guys that's just stupid."

22:46:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:46:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So yeah just shoot yourselves in the foot some more!"

22:46:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stomps on the ground!

22:48:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

22:48:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slides a "Money Maker" key off of an enameled purple space cat keyring.

22:49:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slides a "Money Maker" key onto an enameled purple space cat keyring.

22:49:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow so yeah go blowup a ship which we have a special privilege to be able to purchase. How much intelligence does tht really reaquire."

22:50:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

22:51:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We had to do something, negotiations will be over in like, less than two weeks."

22:52:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:52:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wait you had to carelessly blow up a special ship which enables us to perform work which isn't even built by the AEU and at the expense of the rest of us?"

22:53:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The transports are a symbol, and once they are purchased from United Freight, they belong to the Union. Blowing them up costs the alliance a lot of capital."

22:53:11 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

22:53:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, I wanted to do something more alliance specific, but it seemed as though others were not as for that."

22:53:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably should have done haulers."

22:54:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:54:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm sorry. I just do not follow the logic or mostly lack of logic thereof. So yes at the risk of cutting us off from yet another supplier."

22:54:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, like I don't know if blowing up your transports really helped matters."

22:54:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think it just made it worse, honestly."

22:55:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A strike isn't supposed to be a good thing."

22:55:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:55:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It obviously has and shows that we're um not very rational and well you can strike if you want but you don't have to destroy future prospects. We already have enough problems don't you think?"

22:57:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The goal was not to upset United Freight. The fact that they are upset doesn't really make sense[considering that it cost them nothing, |nd when the strike is over they will just sell more transports. If anyt'ing they should have used it as an advertisement for how good their ships are. We would not have chosen those ships if they weren't hte best for resource management."

22:57:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Look, I ended up crying on the fucking air when mine blew. It's not something I did on a whim, or without caring."

22:58:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:58:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't view it that way at all. It's shoing disrespect for the privilege of being able to purchase a starship which we cannot obtain from any other source for the purpose it is inteded for."

22:58:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And you'don't find that as incentive for the government to end the strike?"

22:59:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We can still purchase transports by the way. You talk as though they aren't selling them to us anymore."

22:59:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:59:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't know but I would not support anything like that. You can choose not to work but destruciton of equipment and otherwise is jsut jeopardizing us particularly that others already don't have a high regard for oru Corps."

22:59:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:59:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our Corps."

23:00:11 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

23:01:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:01:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes for the time-being but I'm sure even if someone has an accident, it will be looked upon very sternly."

23:01:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Stupid."

23:01:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Jsut totally stupid."

23:01:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

23:01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline sighs softly. "I don't know if arguing is getting us anywhere."

23:01:35 Lily says to you, "I hope you didn't do that."

23:01:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I won't hate you for it but you know my viewpoint."

23:02:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

23:03:11 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

23:03:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's fine, she has a right to feel the way she wants to about it I guess, I just don't really appreciate being called stup.d because something unforseen happened. Particularly by someone who was off on a trip while this was going on."

23:04:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We were being ignored, and now we are not being ignored."

23:04:27 Shule frowns sadly, "We were not being heard."

23:05:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:05:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's fine eli and I likewise don't appreciate coming back to being put in a very difficult position over actions which I didn't participate in as well."

23:05:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "" "While that is true," @ says as she sighs, "i just... arguments and me don't mix, I'm afraid. I do have a short fuse, but still.""

23:05:43 You say, "You saw how mcuh the statement we sent to the government, the voting that the Corps did, and the broadcasts that Eli did."

23:05:56 You say, "Hwo much they effected the government."

23:06:07 You say, "They ignored all of them."

23:06:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This all makes me jsut want to go back out there and never come back. Our corps keeps digigng themselves into a deeper and deeper hole."

23:06:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The fact I can barely keep my eyes open is another thing, but I'll worry about trying to bunble through the council meeting as best I can."

23:06:33 You say, "No, doing nothing digs us into a deeper hole."

23:06:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well destorying ships is stupidity."

23:06:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Destroying."

23:07:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You knew what was going on when you left. It's fine that you wanted to [o, but being upset because you didn't have a say in something while you were not here doesn't make sense to me. YOu didn't hear me jumping everyone's ass for voting for Best while I was gone."

23:07:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok I'm sure it won't be long and we'll all have to hand in our licenses anyway."

23:07:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're surely not proving much."

23:07:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We would have waited until you all got back to do anything, but time is running o)t."

23:07:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I was gone too actualy when taht voting commenced."

23:08:08 You say, "I think we are proving that we won't just let things happen."

23:08:11 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

23:08:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glares.

23:08:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not jumping on you Eli just a bit confused on what to say."

23:08:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's fine Eva, everything's fine. Everyone has their point of view."

23:09:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But I wasn't jumping on you to begin with."

23:09:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's like everybody on that shp kept referring to the AEU over and over again as essentially being wreckless and stupid. This jsut proves it mroeso."

23:09:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Moreso."

23:09:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't think you were, that was more referring to being called stupid."

23:09:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nothing we would have done would have turned out well. There's no clean way out of any of this."

23:09:46 You say to Lily, "Then what would you have us do? Nothing?"

23:10:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:10:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I did not call you stupid but destroying starships as an action is stupid."

23:10:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well you didn't have to work if you didn't want to and nobody was obviously nor does force us to in the first place."

23:10:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's ok, Eli. They probably figure we should have just done nothing."

23:10:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh I didn't call you anything of the sort."

23:11:08 You sigh at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:12:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "MAybe we should have just done nothing or more broadcasts? That would have made a difference."

23:13:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think what you did was fine. It proved a point."

23:13:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't care if you decided not to work. There's really no pressure on pilots to work anyway but I just don't htink you all see that destroying a something which we obtain through privilege is important and that concerns me deeply."

23:13:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Those ships don't belong to us, none of our ships do."

23:13:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But lily, it was already done before we got back. Why worry about it now?"

23:22:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, this should be a fun delegation that goes over to talk to the council. We're sure going to look uited with people glaring at each other and such."

23:24:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our reason for going to the Council has nothing to do with our e earlier exchange and I hope you're mature enough to recognize that."

23:25:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline coughs softly and just tapps her communicator for a moment, before clicking off.

23:25:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh better keep the rent on my bomb shelter paid up."

23:26:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "You have a bomb shelter?" Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "How curious? Where is t located so I can color it with paints? I'm kidding, Lily."

23:27:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I left in order for both of us to cool off. You were already glaring at me."

23:27:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I did not glare at you and you know it I glared. That is different."

23:27:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I glared at the situation. If I ever glare at you, you will know it."

23:28:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Since I was the only one in the room and you glared after I said something, how was I supposed to interpret it?"

23:29:07 You can't go that way.

23:29:08 You can't go that way.

23:35:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You weren't there and you didn't give me a chane. If you knew me well enough, you would also know that my transport was named... Well, it had sentimental value to me, but if the AEU withdraws from the Accord... Never mind. I don't even know why I'm telling you this."

23:36:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Chance."

23:38:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Going all in would have been bette., but limiting it to industry only made it a bit easier to get folks on board, I think."

23:46:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And what would popping my medium transport accomplish except to say, look I'm doing it too guys."

23:46:12 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Then Eve, it must be so."

23:46:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The negotiations wil completed within the month, and if Morris thinks we cut off our own noses, then he clearly doesn't know how 'tarship ownership works."

23:46:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I didn't hear it and so if I didn't interact then, how can you assume I heard everything. You really could have given me the benefit of the doubt and discussed this with me rather than being blindsided like this. As I say stopping work, I don't have as much of a problem with. Tht's not what I am angry about."

23:46:34 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "He doesn't know much of what he thinks he does."

23:47:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I say do what you gotta do, stand up _nd fight for what you believe in."

23:47:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And then don't really belong to us, from my u"derstanding. They're alliance assets."

23:47:32 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Agreed. Do what you think is right."

23:51:59 You peer out...

23:51:59 
[Residential Structure; Docking Bay]
This docking bay is relatively quiet compared to most other similar facilities. As with other EAOS docking bays, the entire structure appears open to space, yet no air escapes. Signs indicate that the lobby is on the level above, and Spaceport facilities are below.
The two-person light transport "Jack Of All Trades" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

23:52:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er res>urces."

23:52:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:52:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:52:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:52:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, all right."

23:52:06 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "They will find other jobs."

23:52:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:52:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:52:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Resources, Eli resources."

23:52:13 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "They sure will."

23:52:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:52:25 Which sector did you mean?

23:52:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:52:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:52:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:52:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:52:35 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:52:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Eli, you can do accord missions and what else?"

23:52:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, some of that is communicator static, but yes I did misspeak the first time."

23:52:38 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:52:46 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Probably nests and GMG too."

23:52:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's fine, Eli."

23:52:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ow too meanies but a pretty feathered red kitten."

23:58:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:58:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:58:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:58:20 The sensors tell you that this area of space is remarkably clear and free of hazards.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Residential Structure in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
