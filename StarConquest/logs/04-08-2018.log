Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch
00:50 ow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a bag of felo treats, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
You can go south and out.

(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

00:50 You scramble to your feet.

00:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a small mystic purple bioplastic crate, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:50 There appear to be about 32 pilots recently active.

00:51 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There are pirates in B-29, if any of our lovely Fringe pals would like to help the navy deal with them. I am (adly, too far out at the moment."

00:51 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

00:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

00:53 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:53 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:53 Board what?

00:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.

00:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:53 The ship is already moving.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

02:25 Melinda Michaels asks, "How are you with fighters?"

02:25 Lily Kaise says, "I'm ok."

02:25 You say, "I'm quite comfortable. I took on a mansche in a wasp solo."

02:25 Lily Kaise says, "I haven't soloed a fighter mission in awhile but I can if I need to."

02:25 You say, "I love flying fighters."

02:25 You say, "Or wasps."

02:25 You say, "Or whatever."

02:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

02:26 You grin.

02:26 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:26 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll give more information as time goes on but just be ready."

02:26 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

02:26 You say, "We will be."

02:26 Melinda Michaels says, "It's really big."

02:26 Lily Kaise says, "Ok we will aand it's an nohor to us both that you all would think to ask us."

02:26 You beam at Melinda Michaels.

02:27 You exclaim, "I can't wait!"

02:27 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Wow sorry."

02:27 Melinda Michaels gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:27 You say, "Lily's so excited she can't talk right."

02:27 You laugh.

02:27 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "On a serious note, sorry y'all are going through all this."

02:27 Lily Kaise says, "It's an honor and we both appreciate it that you would think of us."

02:27 Melinda Michaels smiles.

02:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Well, she is one of the best engineers."

02:27 You smile at Melinda Michaels. "Yes, thank you so much."

02:27 Melinda Michaels says, "You're welcome."

02:28 Lily Kaise says, "If there is any other project we can assist with, just let me know and i'll leave it up to Shule to express his own interest but I love doing projects."

02:28 Melinda Michaels says, "I will."

02:28 You smile.

02:28 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "About to be."

02:28 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:28 You say, "I'm happy to help where I can."

02:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Sounds good."

02:29 Melinda Michaels smiles.

02:29 You smile.

02:29 Lily Kaise says, "In a few months I will likely have more availability as well."

02:29 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Sure, I'll be home momentarily."

02:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

02:29 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll keep that in mind."

02:30 You say, "And I try not to bite.... often."

02:30 Melinda Michaels says, "I also want to work on this station crap."

02:30 Lily Kaise says, "I think we should protest this action on the part of Fringe. AEU does want better relationships but this is..."

02:30 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll help."

02:30 You nod.

02:30 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

02:30 Lily Kaise says, "I don't even think Evenea deserves this either."

02:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Surely they don't."

02:31 Shule nods in agreement.

02:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Crazy."

02:31 Lily Kaise asks, "So what they engaged in work activities with League?"

02:31 Lily Kaise says, "Very."

02:31 Melinda Michaels says, "I don't think that's it."

02:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Cause others do that too."

02:31 Lily Kaise asks, "Really then what is it?"

02:31 You say, "No idea, but I'd think it was something bigger."

02:31 Melinda Michaels says, "I think they are putting others interests above the alliance."

02:31 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

02:31 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

02:31 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:32 You say to Melinda, "My thoughts exactly."

02:32 I don't understand that.

02:32 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah then but it's still really heavy-handed."

02:32 You say, "But still."

02:32 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:32 You nod.

02:32 Lily Kaise says, "I don't even think aEU would treat us that way."

02:32 Lily Kaise says, "Except when it comes to Unregs and... well I differ with AEU on that."

02:33 You say to Lily, "But their government isn't the same as ours."

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah it's a bit harsh."

02:33 You say, "But it is harsh."

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "Extremely harsh."

02:33 Lily Kaise nods to you.

02:33 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Crazy."

02:34 You say, "I'm not saying I agree. In fact, I disagree, but their government can do things that ours and the League's shouldn't be able to do."

02:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah my mind is like still in a spin over this I'm just not getting it."

02:34 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Right because it's a dictatorship."

02:34 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

02:34 Lily Kaise nods.

02:34 You say, "Exaclty."

02:34 You say, "Exaclty."

02:34 You say, "Exactly."

02:35 You say, "Wow! I can't talk now."

02:35 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that was my first thought and particularly with that one guy who the Accord took in."

02:35 Lily Kaise says, "Well into custody."

02:35 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "But Elaine hangs with Tanny, Kani with me."

02:35 Lily Kaise says, "Heh and neither will speak to Shule or me."

02:36 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:36 Melinda Michaels asks, "Who won't speak to you guys?"

02:36 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I was on Tesla yesterday doing missions and was signing up for a mission and I waved to Elaine but she just totally ignored me. I'm not gonna bite her!"

02:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

02:37 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay, I have to get going for now but will keep in touch."

02:37 You say, "I'm not around much these days so people don't generally talk to me anyways."

02:37 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:37 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok want a glass of wine beforeyou go?"

02:38 Lily Kaise grins at Melinda Michaels.

02:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Sure."

02:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:38 Lily Kaise removes an elegant crystal decanter from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:38 You say, "Just don't fly under the influence."

02:38 You chuckle.

02:38 Lily Kaise gives an elegant crystal decanter to Melinda Michaels.

02:38 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:38 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:38 Melinda Michaels puts a thick light green letter in a black canvas gear bag.

02:38 Melinda Michaels examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

02:38 Melinda Michaels helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:38 Lily Kaise says, "You know, it's ceremonious with us."

02:38 Melinda Michaels gives an elegant crystal decanter to Lily Kaise.

02:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Thank you."

02:38 You grin.

02:38 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:38 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Sure!"

02:38 Melinda Michaels stands up from a dark faux wood padded chair.

02:38 You stand up from an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.

02:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Good talking to you both."

02:38 Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Melinda Michaels.

02:38 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.

02:38 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

02:38 Lily Kaise hugs Melinda Michaels.

02:38 Melinda Michaels hugs Lily Kaise.

02:38 Melinda Michaels waves.

02:38 Lily Kaise waves.

02:39 Melinda Michaels strides out.

02:39 You beam at Lily Kaise.

02:39 You say, "Woo1."

02:39 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:39 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Just wow!"

02:39 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:39 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That is co cool!"

02:40 Lily Kaise exclaims, "So cool!"

02:40 "It is!" You beam at Lily Kaise.

02:40 Lily Kaise beams at you.

02:40 Lily Kaise says, "I bet ather is likely a part of it too."

02:40 You say, "Oh I'm sure."

02:40 Lily Kaise says, "Based on how he responded yesterday."

02:40 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:41 You say, "I'm certain he's apart of it."

02:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Ather, glad the meeting went well. We just met with Melinda. All's well."

02:41 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:41 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:41 You say, "Guess I'd better go fly fighter beacons and get ready."

02:42 Lily Kaise says, "Well yeah I believe that Evenia's relationship with league is what got her into trouble but I thought Ted and Hank were not as flaming."

02:43 You say, "No idea, but I think Melinda is right."

02:43 Lily Kaise says, "Wtill it's too heavy-handed."

02:43 Lily Kaise says, "Sitll."

02:43 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:43 Lily Kaise says, "Still that is."

02:43 You say, "That's why I'm so glad I am an AEU pilot."

02:43 Lily Kaise says, "I mean that they could have warned them first."

02:44 You say, "They kind of did."

02:44 You say, "I think."

02:44 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah, me too as we pretty much can do what we want unless it's not related to Unregs and... well, I may bet into trouble over that in time."

02:44 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:44 Lily Kaise says, "Get too."

02:45 Lily Kaise says, "Well Melinda sur sscored big with me this time Shule."

02:45 You say, "Remember the Fringe government removed Fringe pilots from organizations run by other alliances. IT was a bit of a warning I think."

02:45 Lily Kaise says, "That is true."

02:46 Lily Kaise says, "But none of them joined other orgs since though and the ones who did went to Fringe orgs."

02:46 You nod.

02:47 Lily Kaise says, "I do see the writing on the wall that Fring and aEU will likely be putting up their own stations soon because Fringe won't be able to participate purely based upon their government."

02:47 You nod.

02:47 Lily Kaise says, "That obviously is of benefit to us but it sucks for everybody."

02:47 You nod.

02:47 You say, "Exactly."

02:48 Lily Kaise says, "I truly would prefer that we all worked together."

02:48 You say, "Yes, in a perfect universe, that would be great."

02:48 You say, "Unfortunately, we can't apparently all work together."

02:48 You frown.

02:48 Lily Kaise asks, "Well even in a universe which isn't perfect. Why can't we just get along?"

02:48 Lily Kaise sighs.

02:48 You say, "Yeah, no kidding."

02:49 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:49 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:50 Lily Kaise whispers, "I so wonder if this will be a mission to try to find the jenu."

02:50 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

02:50 Lily Kaise beams.

02:51 You say, "In which case, we will all need to be at our best and it'll be a long tough trip."

02:51 You say, "But I always love a challenge."

02:52 Lily Kaise whispers, "Yeah because if it's a long mission, there is some goal. Even so, if it's merely for the sake of Exploration, then I will be so honored to assist."

02:52 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:52 You say, "Me too."

02:53 Lily Kaise says, "I'm glad I started saving crafting supplies even way before we encountered the issue with the Skim."

02:53 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:54 You say, "I have plenty of supplies too."

02:54 You smile.

02:54 You say, "Which you are always welcome to."

02:54 You beam at Lily Kaise.

03:04 You say to Lily, "I love you."

03:07 You sit down on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.

03:07 [Pilot Organization Level; Office; Lily Kaise]

03:07 This is a small but tastefully decorated office, with dark carpeting and dark plasteel paneling. A large faux wooden desk is bolted to the floor, facing the door. A large transparisteel window extends over three walls behind the desk. You see a lighted painting of nebular planets, a glowing lighted painting of a magnificent star cluster, and a glowing painting of a starry rift in space hanging on various walls.
You see a dark faux wood desk, a dark faux wood padded chair, a large metal filing cabinet, a small terminal, a luxuriously soft oval amethyst rug with a gold fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed deep amethyst armchair, a shiny round white table with a painted tablecloth in a vivid patchwork pattern, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric, and a closet here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.)

03:07 You stand up from an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric.

03:07 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:07 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:12 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Anyone interested in running a poacher camp?"

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I might could go along on one o'those."

03:18 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

03:19 Lily Kaise returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

03:19 You ask, "What does that mean?"

03:19 Lily Kaise says, "No idea."

03:19 You say, "Oh good. Glad I'm not the only one."

03:19 Lily Kaise says, "Except perhaps they have been productive to bring in more raw materials."

03:19 You say, "Yeah, maybe."

03:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

03:27 You say to Lily, "Let's head back to the ship?"

03:27 You ask, "Or the Torus?"

03:27 Lily Kaise says, "Sure I was just thinking we should."

03:27 Lily Kaise grins.

03:27 You smile.

03:27 Lily Kaise puts an elegant crystal decanter in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:27 You ask, "So, meet back at the torus?"

03:27 Lily Kaise says, "I'm going to drop Ather a note though when we get over there."

03:27 You say, "Ok."

03:27 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:27 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:28 You follow Lily Kaise out.

03:28 [Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Pilot Organization Level]

03:28 You can go north and down.

03:28 You can't go that way.

03:28 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

03:28 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.

03:28 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

03:28 The two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 452" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

03:28 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

03:28 You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.

03:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

03:28 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:28 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:28 I don't understand that.

03:28 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:28 I don't understand that.

03:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:28 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:28 I can't find "sofa."

03:28 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:28 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 452" has launched from New Earth.

03:29 Starships In Sector:

03:29 
Registered Merchant 452.................(5, 18, 16)

03:29 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish" has launched from New Earth.

03:29 Via general sector communication, this ship directs a standard signal at Starfish: "Greetings."

03:29 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 452" has jumped out of the sector.

03:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:29 Via general sector communication, Starfish transmits a text-based transmission: "beep beep"

03:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:29 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

03:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:29 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:29 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

03:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:29 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish" has jumped into the sector.

03:29 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Starfish! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:29 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:30 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:30 You scramble to your feet.
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:30 You exit the ship.

03:30 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 828" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

03:30 [The Torus; Garage]

03:30 You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.

03:30 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:30 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a small mystic purple bioplastic crate, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

13:21 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:21 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Endymion Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

ITERATIVE TARGET TRACKER (Endymion)
Requirements: 0 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 70%

COALITION STANDARD TT ARRAY MK II (Drydock)
Requirements: 0 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%

Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 2 units Near Target Retention: 100% Far Target Retention: 50%

FRINGE NAVAL MASSIVELY PARALLEL TT ARRAY (endymion)
Requirements: 700 combat points
Maximum Targets: 3 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%

Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement information and send that information to your gunners.

13:23 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

13:23 You put a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" in a leather briefcase.

13:23 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

13:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:23 No new changes to display. Type CHANGELOG to read all recent changes.

13:23 Recent Minor Changes:

13:23 
-----
The code that locates a rift accelerating station has been refactored to iterate through all possible matching accelerators instead of stopping at the first one. Or, in plain English: Rift accelerating should behave the same or better, but please let us know if you notice anything odd.
   Posted 4 days, 13 hours, 4 minutes, and 26 seconds ago
-----
Flightlockers now have an EMPTY command, allowing the ship's owner to remove anything from inside them.
   Posted 2 days, 18 hours, 41 minutes, and 31 seconds ago
-----
Ship titles are undergoing an overhaul that will eventually result in their removal. Changes are now in effect for ship purchasing, sales, and destruction. If you suddenly don't own a ship that you should, please let us know!
   Posted 1 day, 17 hours, 50 minutes, and 20 seconds ago
-----
The 'longest-range exploration ship' information in shipinfo is now hopefully nominally more accurate, as it takes various in-flight recharging methods into account.
   Posted 1 day, 9 hours, 29 minutes, and 29 seconds ago
-----


13:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:24 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:24 Endymion Orbit (AEU) [Human Interalliance Space] (Security: Beta-2)
Coordinate rundown:
Starships: Deadly Strike (AEU) at (14, 14, 15)
Planets: (11, 11, 15)
Space Stations: (4, 7, 15)


13:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

13:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:24 You're already sitting.

13:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:24 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:24 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

13:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:24 The starship is already moving.

13:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:24 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

13:24 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

13:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

13:24 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

13:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:24 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

13:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:25 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:25 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:25 You scramble to your feet.

13:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:32 The ship is already moving.

13:32 The ship is already moving.

13:32 The ship is already moving.

13:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

13:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

13:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:34 You scramble to your feet.

15:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

15:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

15:55 You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:55 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:55 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:55 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Anyone feel like a nest?"

15:55 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

15:55 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Sure."

15:55 [Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Sure."

15:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:55 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:55 The ship is already moving.

15:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:55 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:55 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

15:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's a nice ship though."

15:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:55 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:55 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

15:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:55 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:55 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

15:55 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

15:55 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:56 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Ah. I see."

15:56 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:56 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:56 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:56 You scramble to your feet.

15:56 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:56 You exit the ship.

15:56 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

15:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

15:56 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:56 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

15:56 You should probably zip that up before you roll it.

15:56 You zip an insulated purple sleeping bag closed.

15:57 You quickly roll an insulated purple sleeping bag up and and tie it securely with the conveniently attached straps.

15:57 You pick up an insulated purple sleeping bag.

15:57 You put an insulated purple sleeping bag in a leather briefcase.

15:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "I shall not apply yet, I do not think. I notice aetheor mentions unreg issues, could someone expand on that for me."

15:57 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:57 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

15:58 I don't see that here.

15:58 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

16:03 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

16:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well the AEU Government doesn't have any regard for Unregistered pilots. It goes back to the Renegade conflict. There's an incident whereby Unreg pilots have been attacked during recent times as well. The issues with their being no relations with Mutuality aren't being helped with the current perspective. I'd rather not go into any addiitonal information here. I'm sure you can research the historical aspects though."

16:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

16:03 A short gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

16:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pilot Katie Celayla transmits, "Ah I see, and unregs have been. Ah, parking in our parking spaces, for lack of a better phrase?"

16:03 You nod to Lily Kaise.

16:03 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

16:03 You say to Lily Kaise, "Hi love."

16:05 Lily Kaise says to you, "I don't want to be too candid with her over this issue since you know my viewpoint."

16:05 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I understand."

16:05 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

16:06 Lily Kaise says to you, "I'm going to go do some tesla. I know you would like to hangout but I'd like to get some missions done."

16:06 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

16:06 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

16:07 Lily Kaise puts down a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

16:07 You kiss Lily Kaise.

16:07 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

16:07 Lily says to you, "See you later!"

16:07 Lily Kaise glides out.

16:07 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

16:08 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Alexander, nest?"

16:08 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Can't right now, sorry."

16:13 A medium-sized shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

16:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

16:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

16:34 [General Communication] Paisley mumbles sleepily. " I need caffeine before I bathe in the tears of my enemies. And possibly friends."

16:35 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am not quite sure that the Outsiders are capable of excreting tears. Maybe we'll find out if we can ever launch the doomsday bomb which destroys their home planet while having some of them held as prisoners observing."

16:35 [General Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "I doubt that'll ever happen, considering the response whenever the Lowell is launched."

16:35 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No, but it helps me sleep at night."

16:36 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Because I know that I would push that button without hesitation."

16:36 [General Communication] Paisley Jensen transmits, "And here all I wanted was some coffee."

16:36 [General Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "If only we could contact the Jinu."

16:36 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am gloriously deep morning/early afternoon thinker."

16:36 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Hello Paisley."

16:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "This is her secretary. I'll take any messages till she's had coffee. Safer thataway."

16:37 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

16:41 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

16:42 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

16:52 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

16:54 You scramble to your feet.

17:13 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "You could nap sleeping beauty."

17:16 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "One sec will call b-ck when I'm not in the skim."

17:18 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Meet at chet of course. Almost ready."

17:27 Minor Change: The wormhole that must be opened to place the ship into the rift is now treated like any wormhole the ship opens! This means 1) the cost in charge for a wormhole jump will now be deducted when entering the rift, and 2) temporary wormhole drives will now allow a damaged ship to enter the rift.

17:30 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Morning."

17:30 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Hi."
