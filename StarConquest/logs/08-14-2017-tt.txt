Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from
somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  A standalone starmap viewer
appears to be installed here.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows flanked by sheer gold
curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy
bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk
blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage
container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a
cedar dresser, a set of funky asymmetrical shelves, a large bureau, a grey
vee-neck shirt, a pair of cotton briefs, a pair of black corduroy jeans, and
some black leather boots here.
You can go out.
