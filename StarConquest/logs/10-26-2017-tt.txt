Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing red and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself
through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Wow... luxury
long-range sightseers... nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "That.. would
truely be a remarkable ship to take passengers on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh it's my primary ship.
But I'm also an exploration nut."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It can only hold two
passengers though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Heh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ever took anyone
on a... expidition?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not a real expidition, 
no. I've gone out a few hundred lightyears with a partner or two though. I'l be
putting together a platform soon enough, just waiting to see if ATher can do
anything about the skims first."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If he can't,  then I'll
be doing a bare bones expidition."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh.. I was meaning
with paying passengers, one might pick up at the passenger station."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've wasted too much time
trying to get 3 long-ranged sightseers for a platform. I think i'm just gonna
borrow a couple from some other pilots."
A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself
through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  no that would be
really awesome though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah, that's what
I mean. It would be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like pick up a couple of
people that just want to explore for a while and see space? I'd be all over
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I wonder if that's
possible... since that's what that ship seems to be made for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never seen
any passengers requesting a trip like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Though, it's an
approval required ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's less
luxurious cousin isn't, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And is still a
passenger ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the main difference
is that the long-ranged has more charge and living quarters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, smjallest ship with
a shower."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I'm there, now..
looking at them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. smallest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, it has a
shower?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's awesome."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I had to buy a
deluxe shower for my regular one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I'd have one
on the artifact trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Double the
hours.."
A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and
an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It should only
have 2 more hours, right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep,  anything with a
living quarters has a shower. I didn't notice it at first because it's in the
storage room on the sightseer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Showers, living
quarters.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It's the idea ship
for any small, private exploration vessel."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "With 20 hours of
charge, instead of 10!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The normal one
has 18."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Same as the
exploration scout."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "These ships you
can pick up passengers with, though..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm just
saying the normal one has 18 hours of charge, not 10."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "I'm a little lost on
Space Vermin. Got my suit here but can't figure out where to request a mission."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh.. you're right.
it is 18. My bad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Miss read the
specs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "If you go south to
the gally and then up the stairs, you'll find the control center, that's where
you get missions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "South from the
landing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "AH HA! I've found
the bane of my essistance!... or, more like the bane of my credits exsistance.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What... should I
buy!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Small? Standard?
Large? Fancy? So hard to choose!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Ask your girlfriend,
and you'll have no doubt."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Thank the heavens
I don't have one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits an irritating burst of
static.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Giggles."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "And... the
different sizes... hmm...."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Exactly what are you
looking at. Clothes? Jewelry? Hats?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
holovids."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Don't think
impressively large holovid would fit in my flitters storetoom.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "No clue what those
are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "There's a holovid
in the pilot lounge.. if I recall."
A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There is, you just can't
get SSN on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can, however, get SSN
on the one at Chet's Grill."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Eli, I need you
glowing blue wisdom..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Should I, or
should I not buy this impressively large holovid for my flitter?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Maybe smaler."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Smaller.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I am trying to
figure out if it would fit..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it would
fit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I mean, it depends
on how much more stuff you want to put in there. If you don't care about the
space then go for it. You can always move into an apartment later."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh this is neat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Me too.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I'm planning to
move to a larger ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I've decided!"
A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I went with the
only option!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "A... mini."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ahem.. where does
one find those showers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you
might be able to buy some on Ardsley, but I got mine off SSN."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "How usefull is a
flashlight? Really?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Some say that
the light stuns roid dogs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Giving you
enough time to escape."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I'm willing to bet
the repellant might work better so you can actually haul the roid. But I've
never had the pleasure, or pain... of running into one yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Nor have I."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Is there a
photocopier anywhere in the liaison office?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Not sure."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a
green glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think all the
officers have them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In their
offices."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say
org trustee offices have them as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you can't buy
on Chetumal, I'll copy something for you when I'm back in home space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Buy a
photocopier, that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh, I bought one
at landfall, when I was getting the holovid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Roid dogs are real."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Seen them, artus?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Seen them, eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who was that one
cadet? Fidel Besacabres?"
A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "He went out
hauling and was never seen again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "No idea where that
came from."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nope, never seen one, or
heard one. But I've also never seen gunarsh or Euclid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I have though, seen the
hatch of a ship after one was tearing into it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What's a gunarsh?"
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Sheesh. So now I got my battlesuit to
Vermin, selected a mission but now I can't figure out how to start the mission."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "New:grumbles."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox grumbles.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Deploy, then launch."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Deploy doesn't work, already tried that."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Are you in deployment?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or still with the commander?"
[Newbie Help] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "First: Is your suit there?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Doh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Nevermind."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Nevermind, now it makes sense."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox chuckles.
[Newbie Help] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hmm?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "He said it was. Justin, go to the
deployment place."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Hmm, the commander only had space missions
it seems."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That happens sometimes. Since there are
more than 5 missions, and you can only do 5 a day, they vary them up."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "How do I find the beacons that he
mentioned?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't forget about low priority
deployments, and I believe the AEU has a ground mission other than that."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "I launched into space but didn't see any
beacons."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "What did he say about them? There are
different kinds of beacons in SC."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Yup, did a bunch of low missions. Need to
dig myself out of my negative points."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox laughs.
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Get on a crew with other pilots to do
space stuff, do salvaging, deliveries, mail...I think someone recommended a book
that describes a lot of the activities to you recently."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple
plastic kelp.
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "I need to find some RATS."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's from an in-character perspective,
but you might find it helpful."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...for Rats, try any beaconed sector
with debris. Orion, Spinward Cluster, Dusty Reaches...places like that."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a book available in the book
store, a beacon clusters handbook. You might find that helpful."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll get industry for turning in the
cores to the guy in the docking bay at SVP."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Ok, let me check on that book."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It won't be at the space market, mind
you. It will be in the bookstores on capital planets."
A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a
small plastic statue of a Jinu.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
received 286,286.07 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating
Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Are Bari spreader corpses debris chunks?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Ok, thanks."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a
chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green
sea fern.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I wonder if
Katina's disapperance had something to do with it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What channel is
SNN?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "SSN. If you look
on your holo's tuner it should be listed as such."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ah, found it."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Is there a way to scan chunks, to find
out if they are corpses?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "DEBRIS."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hrm... a copper
keyring, for 19.99 eaos?"
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Debris only scans one, as far as I know,
right?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll get a better scanner as you get
more industry points. It'll scan further out."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "As your points go up, other scanners
will become available to you that will scan at a wider range."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What Morris said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want to
store your ship keys in style."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Cool, but doesn't help me much, in
searching for bari spread corpses right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah... no
kidding. But, that's really cheap."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It helps some. Just scan sections of the
sector at a time. I think the one you have now goes out 4 or 6 units."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "All I can suggest is that you move
close to each chunk and scan it. It'll take time, but it works."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Either that or just move to each chunk
and scan it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They really only
insanely overcharge us on phone service and rent and stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We pretty much
pay normal people prices for clothing and food and what not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Oh my, I need to find 20 of them, but at
least that's a solusion."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It should have said so many
units...which isn't how many chunks. It's how the pieces you pull off add up in
your storage."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "You are right, I can't read. 10000."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "So check your storage as you pull those
off with the STORAGE command or I think CARGO works the same. Once you have at
least 10K units, transfer it somewhere and complete the mission."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Yes, will do that, when I find them."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Things will get easier. But there are
many ways to make industry points."
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings
itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it
withdraws.
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Yes, I just follow the guide lines, and
do vermin missions, and finding corpses is one of them."
Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs sighs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "And.. I was about
to send Katina something in the mail.. too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why can't you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Wpn't be any use
till she is brought back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you meant
you were going to send her something before she disappeared."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought you
meant you tried just now and couldn't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "No... I was
thinking about it, then remember that's she's disappeared."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Was it a
muffin?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "So.. where at
ardsley is this shower?"
Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it's
there, but I could be wrong. I also don't remember exactly which store it would
be in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But there is one
that sells soap and other showering supplies."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's a shower on
Ardsley?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought there
was, but it's been quite some time since I looked."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe it was on
Mars."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

think we spoke before?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's going
okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Glad to hear that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Kim? You know
Katina?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yes, we hwe have
met."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Why are you asking?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And good morning by
the way, Jonathan."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Well.... she's
disappeared. close to two days ago in the rift. They've been searching for her
since, and haven't had any luck finding her."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh no! Disappeared,
that does not sound good at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It's been reported
to the Accord and EAOS... maybe they can figure something out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I know we don't have
a full account of what happened, but how can a person disappear in the rift?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "We don't know.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "She walked out of
the room, and disappeared."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "This was just
after some Rift Entities, Birds, appeared and built a stone cairn."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ug, rift travel is
getting dangerous."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do wonder what
those rift entities are trying to tell us though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It's always been
dangerous, from what I understood of it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Let's put it this
way, so far the worst we have experienced are burned clothes, someone had a
burning chain around their ankel once which obviously caused a nasty burn, and
similar things. But someone just vanishing? I do not remember that ever
happening before."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah... The member
of the accord we were speaking with said, and a quote, "That's a new one.""
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Eli."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How are you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, I am good,
although shocked, because Jonathan just told me about Katina."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Someone should've
posted about it on the boards... So, if anyone is out in the rift, and katina
Randomly appears back on there ship, they are not going... "where... did you
come from?!?""
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure she'd be able to
fill them in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, yeah, Katina
just appearing on someones ship could be a shocking experience."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Not if for whatever
reason she were unconscious or who knows what?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I suppose not. Though at
this point mostly everyone knows I think. I guess it can't really hurt to post
about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Most of us are around
every day, so I would imagine they have already heard about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And don't forget,
rift entities have once taken food from Ather's party at his home, and delivered
it to Anfisa's ship about 6 weeks earlier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I just really hope
that she will be found soon, darn I am worried now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. I'm not sure this
means anything really. but it's interesting that there are 4 pilots shown out of
comms now, but only 3 actually shown on the list."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hopefully that's a good
sign."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It could also just
mean someone is hauling roids out of comms range or something like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Very true, but I've been
keeping an eye on it all day. If there's someone hauling out there, they must
just be sleeping out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim sighs a deep sigh: "Darn, well, at least
she is home."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep, that's the
important thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's really
nothing like learning that nobody died."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You've got that
right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Although I have heard
stories about people surviving in the rift, even for years."

understatement."

you didn't finish it?"
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Yeps. And when using the cash, I didn't
get it, but when I used credit I did."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Sorry for the wrong grammar."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's kind of odd. They both work the
same."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "You cash out in a special rook
called the electrostatic electrostatic exchange. In my experience, it asks you
what you want to cash out in, points, credits, or a balance."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Room, that is."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Either that or you can purchase
minimodules for your suit or higher Tesla equipment as it's available."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "I know, did once or so, but had some
left, now they seem to be gone, but it was only 7 tesla, so..."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "This I know nothing about, but I do
know you lost points. Could the loss of tesla stuff be related?"
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Who knows."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well somebody."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did you have the teslabucks after your
point reduction happened?"
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Well, no big problem, just wondered,
where have my 7 tesla credits gone."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, 7 is...not much at all. Kind of
like losing a few hundred credits or something. Not a big deal at any rate."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, stuff disappearing might be
the penalty I guess, but yeah, 7 isn't much, so try not to worry about it."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "True, but could have been, and I just
didn't expect that."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I asked if the disappeared at
the same time as your points went down or after."

if I recall. It was discussed here. That's what I'm talking about."

asked about it, so..."

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Twenty-four days into the term, here is the
state of the corps! AEU pilots have completed 17 out of 111 total beacon drops,
which according to the figures from last week, is not really much of a step up!
We have also destroyed 5 out of 13 total destroyed RATS nests, which is pretty
decent. Lastly, we've managed to complete the only salvage op that has been
completed this term, and we've only hauled in 130 out of 1220 total hauled
asteroids, which I believe was the number from last week, so that number may not
have changed, but I don't remember. No new planets have been recorded as
discovered so far in the current term. [20:34 27 October 2317 GST]

really.."

light armor nor light seem like worthwhile modules for the tier 4 AEU suit."

point?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are either of
those commonly used?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Triggs, is there a reason
you singled me out on that? Three different people said the same thing."

does have flash."

"Never put armor on an AEu suit but I do have the light module on my AEU 5. I've
used it a few times to burn during our cleansing missions. You have to be super
careful with the light abilities on an AEU suit as drawing attention to an aEU
suit isn't a good idea. Anyways, I was nearly asleep here. Talk with you later."

Just... being a pilot for... a month and a half. It's just getting very old the

so they have say it. I'm also tired... That may not have come out the way I
wanted it to."

didn't understand why it was only me saying it that seemed to bug you. Ather and
Evenia both said it beforehand I believe. I was mostly just curious."

of the questions asks what previous expeditions I've organized."

anything. I honestly think they are more concerned about the other questions
when it comes tot he Sightseer."

going to organize an expidition in a sightseer."

approval. It's approved by hermes communication."

[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Is there a way to figure out the
gender of a person, without seeing them? My character would be able to tell who
someone is, I.e, male or female, by voice pattern one can assume, so I'd rather
not muck this up.."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It happens and we gloss over it. There's
not a way, unfortunately."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Try to figure it out from their name then
assume amy mistakes you make thereafter are because you couldn't tell frmo their
voice for some reason?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what people generally do, yes."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "K thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "How fair you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am doing well. And
how about you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Average?
Perhaps. I'm not particularly down, yet, I find little to make myself... what is
the phrase... high in the clouds?"
[Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Any interest in beacons?"
[Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Me."
[Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Anyone else i'd need 3
more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do think I have
heard your voice or seen your name before, but I might be wrong. In any case,
welcome to the pilot corps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "You may have?
I've been around, and then about some. Thank you, neve rthe less."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, things have
slowed down a bit, but you are right, the situation with the AEU is grave, and
our president does not realize."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Indeed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Someone needs
to... deal with him, before his ineptitude causes us to be the ones being dealt
with."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey it's Katie the
katemeister."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Eli!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Kim!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits an irritating
burst of static.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ouch."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hey, guys!
Don't drop an ftl communication device."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie transmits in an amused voice: and,
katemeister? That's... new?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You are probably
right that dropping a communicator does not do it much good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Mmhmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Also, do'nt set them on
fire."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, no..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "But the
salesman told me it was fire proof! What a con."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Has anyone ever done
that though?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, they give out those
charred ones to cadets sometimes. I like to think that's what happened."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Eli probably
has."

there will be. Right now I am mining and colecting debris."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How are you trying to
raise that, Katie?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Are you doing svp
missions, or just seeking rats?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Just seeking
rats. I did do an svp mission, but that is now done."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "It's tesla times!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, hmm. I guess
the real way to do something about that is beacons, maybe later."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Indeed. I've
not tried the easy beacons on my own, nor do I think I really should, but
beacons I've done only once."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Is it fun?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Perhaps I
should again?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie sounding almost dismissive, though
perhaps not meaning too: they're alright
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "I think I
understand..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, beacons are fun,
but I would not do them solo, hmm, or maybe if you feel really very confident in
a rental ship?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And although they are
fun to do, never forget we are doing serious work with them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Of course not, 'll
never forget that."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Me? And I tend
too. How come."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Glittering currently and when old Frontier is open that's the best place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, agreed with
what Lily said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If a ship lands that is
infeected with bari, and your ship is powered up, there is a very,  very high
chance it will spread to your ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Thanks, will go there
later, when done mining on tesla."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The actual chance of that
happeneing is lowish, but if it does,  having more ships infected will escalate
the problem."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I'm aware. I
meant how come you're mentioning it? I might have forgotten maybe once... It's
not something I make a habit of. Usually if its up and empty, its because I'm
running down to repair and rearm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, folks are just
cautious. There's always that chance you didn't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie slowly, I see
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"There is a book in the Conference Room of the office Building concerning the
seriousness of Bari. It is a good read as well as other books in the Library
case on the table there."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie transmits, her tone carefully calm,
madam Kaise, I appreciate your concern, but I do not need a lecture on bari. I
am quite aware of what they can do.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup
made it to 20k Industry I hope I never have to do that again!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hmm... did you get
anything special? I mean besides just the increase in industry based stuff."

with... that help you offered."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, help, with what
again?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Well, you
see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I might be....
dead in the water. as in, out of charge, in space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh dear."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And where abouts are
you?"

cluster."

I feel like a freekin' hamster."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, do you have a
charge booster on you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie after the sounds of rummaging through a
handbag, nope.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The bubble you are in
should contain a reset function, look around you for that. It gives you about 10
minutes of charge. Just enough to jump to new earth or providence gate at
least."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "2 minutes
left... come on, come on, get to providdance, come on!"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Do you have enough
charge to make it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I've landed
and its recharging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey everybody."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good, now get 2
things. A few charge boosters, at least 3 and a spacesuit, in case this happens
again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Stone man! The
nest man1 me love you long time if you run nest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie giggles
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And try not to let
that happen again. Spinward cluster is not particularly safe, if a pirate or ifs
ship hops in, you do not stand much of a chance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Won't happen
again. I was just very distracted, and this is my first time flying this ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "We all learn by doing
mistakes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not upset with
you, just said it for your own protection and well being out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, we do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Indeed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Not sure I'm a
fan of our fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, is it
out?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmmm?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, do you just
mean the mark 3 fighter?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I t/in{`she means the
reg]$ar one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
a fighter is not a long-range starship and it's built for compactness so one
needs to just observe their power gage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Mhm. I meant
the little cadet buyable fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I dunno. It's
not so much the power that's bugging me out. It just seems... I dunno...
disappointing, somehow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's pretty
solid for what it is. Though if we ever get those patriots I'll use one of those
instead."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Nope.
Definitely prefer golden dawn."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That
very fighter most of us keep as our stock fighter as once it's upgraded it is
very usefuul and always will be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Useful that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I do
have time to lead a nest is people are interested."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Thought I would've
had my full license by now.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I know the
feeling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Poacher drones,
where?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Any drones that aren't doing other tasks
will do it, so will defense buildings."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, wha, never mind
me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I am most
impressed with my new battlesuit weapon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Duel laser
pistels. Probably tiny to everyone else, but its very nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I remember
them, they were nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It's been quite a
while since I used them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Wish they could kill
poachers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, dual lasers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I am curious.
Is there a charge to be obtained to help with the destruction of transmission
towers? Or is it a case of lasering the hell out of them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Just a case of
lasering the hell out of them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Mm kay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
don't remember but I might have lobbed a detonator at those once or twice."

icly."

command, to my way of thinking."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Exactly."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I called it a command though."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some

[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I asked if there's a command to request
the tracking array to repeat what it's tracking."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Enter the command on your console to fire
the minicannons sounds totally ICly to me."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Right. I just thought your wording
was a bit close to the line is all."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ehh...I wouldn't sweat that."
[Newbie Help] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah just referr to it
as a button or something displayed on a terminal where applicable."

[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yes, and mini is mini."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Can be shortened as much as ch."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Thank ya."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can shorten it all the way to ch if
that's more your thing."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "That's useful I've been typing chain."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "And to answer your question Kert, there
really isn't. It isn't our place to critique others' RP."
[Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "CH will work? I've been having to use cha.
Maybe I have an old alias from another game setup that I didn't realize."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ch works, yes."

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "But yeah. Ch is the shortest for
chainguns."

extra drone?"
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yes, you can build more."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can, build drone factories."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Julius, I'd recommend sitting down with
another character that does asteroid mining. Might make it a bit easier."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, research drone replicator then
build that, after that you can build more drones with it. You can only have as
many drones as your towers can control though."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "I know, actually not my question, I
asked: can you buy one?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, you can only get more by researching
and then building the factories."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Everything is paid for with metals and
has to be built somehow."

thanks *smiles*."
[Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "It should really not take that long."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I said to sit down with
another character who mines."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Wouldn't help. 4 tasks, but only 3
drones."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Most mines don't take more than four
hours or so. Early mines, much less than that. Right now there's no book on the
market, so sitting down with someone is the best way."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is a solution to that."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Thanks friend. I'll find it, and my
mentor, if it ever gets online."

at your coordinator?"

you can't build it."

should tell that instead of saying not enough metals I think."

[Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We cannot disclose information about
quests in the game. It's just one of those things we don't do. We just say "look

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may

here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go east and south.
