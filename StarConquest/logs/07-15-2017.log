A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and Mischief the large black felo here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out.

01:11:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:40:14 Lily Kaise dangles a piping hot turnover filled with meatball in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

01:41:24 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:41:27 I don't understand that.

01:41:30 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

Therefore, I am sending out this comm notice to inform you that starting at midnight on the 17th of this month, I will be holding a fighter combat contest. During the following eight days, I will keep track of which fighter has destroyed the most outsider, battle thrall, and allied pirate ships. At the end of those eight days, the first, second, and third place winners will receive a cash prize. I will also make a board post about it. Let's all participate and good luck to those who do.

04:58:22 Subject: AEU Solo Combat Fighter Challenge
--
Attention AEU pilots,
It's time to improve our space combat skills, especially solo combat in a fighter. Starting at midnight on July 17, the Space Defense office will be holding a contest to see how many outsider, battle thrall, IFS, and allied pirate ships can be destroyed by a single fighter in eight days. The top three winners will receive a cash prize! Here are the rules!
1. Only outsider, outsider, battle thrall, and allied pirate ships will count towards the number of ships destroyed.
2. You may only use an AEU, short-term rented, or long-term rented fighter-class ship. Otherwise, I will not see it on my reports.
3. RATS and bari spreaders do not count.
4. If you plan to participate, but rent a ship from out at Tannhausser Gate or rent an org ship, please send me via mail the name of the ship you used and the approximate time you finished your combat so that I may credit destroyed ships to the correct pilot.
5. Only qualifying ships destroyed during the contest period will count.
When will this contest take place? From midnight on July 17, until 2359 on July 24.
Prizes:
First place: 50 million credits
Second place: 35 million credits
Third place: 20 million credits
If you have questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me. Good luck!
Shule Elemmire, Space Defense Captain

18:35:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You know, I've never used it."

18:35:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The instantaneous speed is amazing, but I wonder if the reduced weapon efficiency would be manageable with a fighter's limited charge."

18:35:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I'll test it out."

18:35:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Go for it."

18:54:41 Lily Kaise grins.

18:55:58 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah mine got down to my waist. It's too heavy and hard to manage at that length for me though.

20:33:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Heres the thing I believe helps, your first and second goal seem to consist of industry and space combat primarily.

20:54:36 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Too big?"

20:54:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

20:54:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I use it to move my medium transport all the time."

20:55:03 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I don't understand the mechanics."

21:59:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I am compressing though."

22:03:29 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:03:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "If you are in the sector, you just see it fall apart. Some of it shows up in debris at times but i've never tried to reuse a module which fell off of a station. I don't think they work though."

22:07:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Haha,&so{ry to make <ou tr'n%late."

22:07:36 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:07:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "At any rate, should always consider that using any temporary space station is not as secure. That it is vulnerable and you really should not leave ships out there unless you are keeping up with the life span of the station."

23:36:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
23:36:29 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.

23:38:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No like torpedo launchers for ships."
