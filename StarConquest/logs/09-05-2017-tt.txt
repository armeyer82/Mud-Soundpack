Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another

Minor Change: By popular demand, organizations can now be added to warehouse
ACLs.
[MTTS] alc_71: Yea, thanks.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Brilliant.
[MTTS] Ulias: How popular was the demand? We talkin prom king here? Or just
like.. guy who is kinda cool and most folks know at least a little about him.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Several tickets.
[MTTS] Squidmind: There's a lot of tickets requesting different ordering and
formatting styles for warehouses, and we want to get to them, but that's a lot
easier said than done.
[MTTS] Ulias: Well this recent change sounds like it will certainly make things
easier on folks, if it means what I think it means.
[MTTS] alc_71: It sure will.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Well I've got no doubt you guys are doing what you can. Either
way, these warehouses just make life a hundred times easier.
[MTTS] Squidmind: It means that you can allow, say, CUSTOM as a whole instead of
every single member of the org manually.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Which means a ton less messing about, and confusion.
[MTTS] Squidmind: It puts everything in one place, and the number of ships named
something 'Mega Deep Dicking Them Spare Stations' has decreased slightly.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Named something like, rather.
[MTTS] Butchulla: You guys are making our lives so easy, that pretty soon people
will be asking why stations aren't building themselves.
[MTTS] alc_71: I imagine there has been a decent reduction of database bloat.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I'd hope so, at least.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We noticed that it was practically becoming a full-time job
for some people, and that expedited implementation of the warehouse system.
[MTTS] alc_71: I am sure those people are quite thankful and happy.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I'm quite sure they are too.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We never intended stations to be both a practically a
permanent fixture and constant busy work when we set out to implement them.
[MTTS] alc_71: When the accelerators got added in, that increased the workload.
At least, that is how it seems to be. But it's a nice set up.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Now if we could please have temp station launchers...
[MTTS] Butchulla: Kidding, kidding.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Those used to be a thing! And practically still are, if you're
AEU.
[MTTS] alc_71: If we go to war with the AEU, maybe we can nab the constructors.
Kidding. Haha.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Hahaha. Nice thought. If only we could all have those nice

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top, and a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars
here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

few hours to be here. Ather and Eli were in protest by the aEU Tower. I had to
get that beacon up so Ather wasn't happy. I just turned off my comm because
first off, the comm gets garbled as you travel out there and I didn't want
Johann yelling at me. So I felt caught in the middle."
