Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a dark violet
fabric armchair, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a black

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her
head, face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

once we reduced trim and went yellow and such."

Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.
Gonzales Bourne says to Keegan, "It's best to keep the main heading to south.
When we lose them, we could ever so slowly get back to our original heading.
Going upward is fine, but might want to wait a little before turning southwest.
So we don't get back into their range."
Lily Kaise pats Gonzales Bourne on the back.
Keegan Wantz says, "I'm thinking that uhh."

Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh."

Keegan Wantz says, "No."
Keegan Wantz says, "We're evading it."
Keegan Wantz says, "They proceeded to where they last saw us, after we swapped
to yellow alert and all that fun stuff."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right... isn't thatthe same thing? or is it not chasing
us."
Keegan Wantz says, "It's not chasing us."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "...oh."
Keegan Wantz says, "They can outrun rift drives superrrr easy."
Hawthorn Dunn sighs. "Well, that's a relief."
Keegan Wantz says, "They have tech that's called uhh, phased warp drives, pretty
sure."
Hawthorn Dunn asks, "So what's the plan do we keep going the same direction and
keep trying to dodge them? Or are we changing course?"
Keegan Wantz says, "Same direction."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh. Huh. Well that sucks."
Keegan Wantz says, "The important thing is becoming a much smaller energy
signature."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ah."
Keegan Wantz says, "Nah, I wanted to turn south soon anyway."
Keegan Wantz says, "We're getting near the 'gotta turn around for battery
reasons' point."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "I gotcha."
Keegan Wantz says, "Well."
Keegan Wantz says, "Not -gotta-."
Keegan Wantz says, "But I want to have plenty of buffer."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Though I mean... I'm freaked out as hell. I want this to go
well for you. And it'd be shitty to be blown up or worse."
Keegan Wantz says, "Eh, we're fine."
Keegan Wantz says, "This is why I went over evading patrols with everyone who
didn't know already, who was around."
A pleasing, throbbing warmth suffuses your body.
Keegan Wantz says, "And posted it."
Keegan Wantz pats a message board reader lightly.
Hawthorn Dunn nods.
Keegan Wantz says, "Uhh."
Keegan Wantz glances around at his surroundings.
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "2.51."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Switch to yellow, turn off all unnecessary systems... try
and dodge and get out of dodge."
Keegan Wantz says, "Yep."
Keegan Wantz says, "Getting off our original heading helps, the flow was
conveniently handy, this time."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "I just wonder if they're protecting something or just
jumping about for prey."
Keegan Wantz says, "The latter, usually."
Keegan Wantz says, "They don't want us to get too far from home."
Keegan Wantz says, "Keeps us from contacting other aliens and whatnot."
Keegan Wantz shrugs.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "So...are we operating under the no risk no reward policy at
this point or..."
Keegan Wantz says, "Like I said, we're offsetting our course until about 50%
charge or so, then heading home."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Keegan Wantz says, "Maybe a little bit lower than 50% charge, we'll see."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Yeah. I mean I don't really wanna book it home. But god
that had me stressed out as hell. Like what a thing to wake up to. I'm glad
Gonzales is good at what he does."
Keegan Wantz says, "Basically, we've been heading out for uhh."
Hawthorn Dunn nods.
Keegan Wantz says, "Almost 6 days at this point, about 6 days when we hit 50%
charge."
Keegan Wantz says, "Ship's battery is about 3.7~ days, give a bit."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right."
Keegan Wantz says, "Overall, we've got justtttttt about 15 days of charge."
Keegan Wantz says, "So I want to have a full extra day of buffer, for the way
home."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "That'd be good."
Keegan Wantz says, "Because we could hit a calm or something like that."
Keegan Wantz says, "Or another patrol, yellow alert drains battery like woah."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "If you do manage to help us get an exploration ship maybe
you should ask them if we have the knowledge to give us enhanced cloaking for
stealth maneuvers and stuff like this."
Keegan Wantz says, "Gotta use the head, back shortly."
Keegan Wantz says, "Ha, I doubt this will be enough for that."
Keegan Wantz says, "It's the... third? Fringe expedition pretty much ever."

Clarina Taylor says, "Well then."
Keegan Wantz says, "Not that some people did not try to get subsumed."
Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Like Asteris!"
Keegan Wantz says, "I never experienced myself, but supposedly if it started
sharing bits of itself with you, your perceptions expanded in a terrifying
manner."
Keegan Wantz says, "Asteris loved that shit."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "That...sounds disturbing."
Keegan Wantz says, "And never could go back to properly being a pilot
afterwards."
Keegan Wantz says, "Hence, her retirement."
Keegan Wantz says, "Anyway."
Keegan Wantz says, "Euclid brought us to Fienstein, after coaxing."
Hawthorn Dunn asks, "You had to convince it to let you go?"

and he... willed the rift to transport us to the,,, Torus? more or less."

the rift?"

Keegan Wantz says, "He was... awfully surprised when we popped up."
Keegan Wantz says, "We still don't know how exactly Fienstein managed that, but
it worked."
Ather Jammoa says, "His reaction was more comical when Euclid popped in after
us."
Ather Jammoa says, "Fienstein was in the rift for well over 10 years. He learned
the finer points of manipulating it to his will."
Keegan Wantz says, "Aye, it was uhh."
Keegan Wantz says, "Rather.. intriguingly terrifying."
Keegan Wantz says, "After that point, Euclid stuck around in realspace for
awhile, appearing in peoples' bathrooms and whatnot."
Keegan Wantz says, "But we have not seen or heard from it in a long time."
Keegan says to Ather, "Have any good ones?"
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "If anyone else wants to tell a story, keep in mind that
it does not have to be related to us in any way. Could be spooky! Could be
heartwarming!"

Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu was, by all accounts, a perfeclty pleasant individual
with a few imperfections. You see, he often enjoyed leaving his starships
floating in space while he took naps."
Ryan Thomas says, "Oh dear."
Keegan Wantz puts a hyperspanner in a navy blue canvas backpack.

Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.
Ryan Thomas says, "I fought Mister Kelsey once, actually."
Ryan Thomas says, "But anyway."
Ryan Thomas says, "Keegan's first."
Clarina Taylor chortles.
Continuing to wave his right hand through the air, Keegan continues, "One of
these times, a lovely Fringe pilot by the name of Keegan decided he would teach
Meteu Gamrey a lesson."
Blake Madison sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.
Clarina tilts her head.
Stilling his hand, Keegan says, "So, one day when our lovely little Meteu
stalled his ship in space, Keegan SWOOPED!" he brings his left hand close to his
right, before saying, "Oh, I actually..."
Keegan Wantz removes an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch
Vessel "Confiscated Goods" from a navy blue canvas backpack.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Ah, excellent!"
"Woo the hero of the story," Hawthorn cheers half heartedly, looking interested.
Holding an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel
"Confiscated Goods" in his right hand, Keegan moves his left hand towards the
starship model.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "SWOOPED IN!"
Keegan Wantz says, "Very slowly, mind you, he was using a throw-away flitter."
Hawthorn leans forward and nods. "mm."
Keegan Wantz says, "And painfully slowly."
Moving his hands at a glacial pace, Keegan opens the hatch on an intricate scale
model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods".
Keegan Wantz says, "Cracked open the hatch."
Clarina Taylor says, "Oh dear."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh boy..."
Keegan Wantz says, "And left Meteu Gamrey on the flitter."
Keegan Wantz says, "Before undocking, and flying the Heavy Launch Vessel off
into space."
Clarina Taylor says, "I'm sure he was ecstatic."
Hawthorn Dunn chortles.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Now, Meteu Gamrey was rightfully shocked!"
Keegan Wantz asks, "Who ever would take his precious Heavy Launch Vessel?"
Keegan Wantz says, "After having him wait for a few hours, Keegan Wantz revealed
himself."
"Heh." Hawthorn Dunn arches an eyebrow. "I would've never said until he saw it
flying around."
Clarina Taylor slumps on a soft azure blue knitted blanket and goes to sleep.
Ryan Thomas says, "Maybe that's how he revealed himself."
Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.
Puffing his chest out, Keegan says, "AH! METEU! It was I, Keegan, who took your
starship! Let this be a lesson!"
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "For if you ever leave it in space again, I will take it
for a longer period of time!"
Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu, chided, returned to his starship."
Keegan Wantz says, "But this tale is not at an end, for less than a week later,
he did it again."
Ryan Thomas says, "Oh dear."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "This time, it was right above Old Earth!"
Keegan Wantz says, "Keegan Wantz, being the benevolent man that he is, liberated
that poor starship from Meteu Gamrey's neglectful hands."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "But ho!"
Keegan points off towards the base block, and says, "A Nissi Valdaire did not
approve!"
Keegan Wantz says, "You see, despite his noble goals, Keegan Wantz was
technically commiting piracy."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "The League would not stand for it! They wanted that
starship returned immediately!"
Keegan Wantz says, "So Nissi chased, and Keegan ran."
Keegan Wantz says, "Until Keegan got bored."
Ryan Thomas asks, "Did keegan run in the heavy launch vessel?"
Rubbing at his chin lightly as he waves an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99
League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods" around in the air, Keegan says,
"And he thought, 'Well, I intend to return this starship anyway, so let us make
this a fun return!'"
Keegan Wantz says, "So he stopped for long enough for Nissi and Miah to dock."
Keegan Wantz says, "And Nissi borded his Confiscated Goods."
Keegan Wantz says, "Boarded, pardon."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "And thus, Keegan and Nissi fought!"
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "They fought over the controls!"
Clarina Taylor suddenly awakens.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "They punched eachother in the face!"
Ryan Thomas gasps.
Ryan Thomas exclaims, "Oh dear!"
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "There were several groin shots!"
Matteo Hapta blinks heavily and then dozes off.
Clarina Taylor says, "Sacrelige."
Keegan Wantz says, "Eventually, Keegan was tired of fighting, and simply said,
'Fine, fine! I'll stop.'"
Keegan Wantz says, "Nissi punched him anyway."
Keegan Wantz says, "One last time, for good measure."
Ryan Thomas chuckles.
Clarina wags her finger.
Lily Kaise snickers.
Keegan Wantz says, "And thus, the starship was returned to Meteu once again."
Matteo Hapta slumps on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa and goes to sleep.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "But this tale is still not at an end!"
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "For once again, Meteu did the unthinkable!"
Ryan Thomas exclaims, "Of course he did!"
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "He left his starship in space!"
Clarina Taylor exclaims, "That bastard!"
Clarina Taylor smiles.
Keegan Wantz says, "And this time, Keegan was not feeling benevolent."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "And so he took!"
Clarina Taylor asks, "What did this Keegan do?"
Keegan snatches an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch
Vessel "Confiscated Goods" with both hands, and shoves it into his backpack.
Keegan Wantz puts an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch
Vessel "Confiscated Goods" in a navy blue canvas backpack.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "He took the starship!"
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "And he claimed it for his own!"
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Dubbing it Confiscated Goods, as Meteu's efforts to
protect himself were lacking!"
Keegan Wantz says, "There was some huff and puff."
Keegan Wantz says, "But Keegan would not return the starship."
Clarina Taylor stands up from a soft azure blue knitted blanket.
Clarina Taylor wanders north.
Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.
Clarina Taylor sits down on a soft azure blue knitted blanket.
Keegan Wantz says, "And he utilized it for a long while, making many profitable
trade runs."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "'PIRATE!' they cried!"
Keegan Wantz says, "But Keegan did not care."
Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu had brought this upon himself."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "He was warned, warned, and warned again!"
Keegan Wantz says, "But this tale does end pleasantly for Meteu, in a way."
Keegan Wantz says, "You see, Keegan had a few friends."
Keegan Wantz says, "One Stephen Lanburn, at the time, had an idea."
Lily Kaise asks, "In low places?"
Lily Kaise grins.
Keegan Wantz says, "Conquest was starting, and we were originally competing."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "So for the Glory of the Civilian Fleet, Keegan Wantz and
Stephen Lanburn, as well as one of Keegan's ex ladyfriends attacked!"
Keegan Wantz says, "The League Navy."
Clarina Taylor says, "Ex lady friends."
Clarina Taylor grins.
Keegan Wantz says, "The poor League Navy."
Ryan Thomas says, "Oh god."
Lily Kaise says, "Oh my."
Keegan Wantz says, "Who were not a part of any of this."
Keegan Wantz says, "And thus, these pilots were blacklisted from League Space,
for a very long time."
Clarina Taylor applauds sedately.
Keegan Wantz says, "But cooler heads prevailed."
Keegan Wantz says, "Eventually, the League and the Fringe reached an agreement."
Keegan Wantz says, "They would be allies."
Keegan Wantz says, "But the Fringe would not pirate League starships."
Keegan Wantz says, "And Keegan Wantz, as per the blacklisting, was forced to
return his Confiscated Goods."
Ryan Thomas laughs.
Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu Gamrey, after all of that, had his ship once again."
Keegan Wantz bows.
Clarina Taylor asks, "Did he fall asleep again?"
Lily Kaise slumps on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch and goes to sleep.
Keegan Wantz says, "If he did, I did not take advantage of it."
Ryan Thomas says, "That was pretty awesome."
Clarina Taylor says, "We had a sleeper too for a time."
Clarina Taylor asks, "What was his name? I can't remember. WAs it Jack?"
Ryan Thomas says, "Might have been."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Keegan Wantz says, "Sec before you start your story, Ryan, gonna check charge."
Keegan Wantz says, "That one was a bit lengthy."
Keegan Wantz strides north.
Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Oh!"
Keegan Wantz says, "That was not the final starship that Keegan Wantz stole,
however."
Keegan Wantz removes an intricate scale model of the AH-12 AEU Soothsayer-class
Cruiser "Sol Invictus" from a navy blue canvas backpack.
Keegan Wantz says, "One day, Kaito Zalmont stopped paying attention in Mir."
Keegan Wantz says, "So Keegan Wantz stole a Soothsayer from Kaito and sold it to
the Fringe government."
Keegan Wantz beams.
Ryan Thomas says, "Oh damn."
Clarina Taylor says, "Good lord."
Keegan Wantz puts an intricate scale model of the AH-12 AEU Soothsayer-class
Cruiser "Sol Invictus" in a navy blue canvas backpack.

Clarina Taylor stands up from a soft azure blue knitted blanket.
Clarina Taylor picks up a soft azure blue knitted blanket.
Clarina Taylor puts a soft azure blue knitted blanket in a large dark blue
canvas duffel bag.
Ryan Thomas says, "But, I think it was Jonathan Gray who menchened pirates in
Tesla."
Clarina Taylor asks, "Weren't there ifs first?"
Ryan Thomas shrugs.
Ryan Thomas says, "And he was up there with a shit load of them in a clipper by
himself. And the mantice Julian decided it would be ok to give them shows up."
Ryan Thomas says, "And we get a crew together and go to tesla and start fighting
the mantice. And well I just got mine, you see, so I was quite bad. And it was
late and I mean it was my first real thing you know? It was more serious than
the few fighters or the gunship we'd get. There were a lot."
Ryan Thomas says, "So I am losing. Badly. My crew was not best crew that day.
Not in that fight."
Ryan Thomas says, "But anyway, we're near tesla so i'm like i'm gonna repair."
Clarina Taylor laughs.
Ryan Thomas says, "And I land and do the whole repair thing and go back up. And
get hit with....something."
Ryan Thomas says, "I would have liked to put my starship up against Keegan's
flitter in a race at that point, because it did something to the drive."
Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.
Keegan Wantz nods.
Ryan Thomas says, "And it just.....wouldn't move. like I think we could have
walked faster to get out of the way. I thought surely we were done. But rather
anticlimacticly, they unloaded a few times on us, jumped out and ever since then
I'd kinda like a rematch."
Keegan Wantz says, "Ahahahaha."
Keegan Wantz says, "Probably a bolt."
Ryan Thomas says, "And oh man I wanted it bad for a while like, I would go hunt
pirates wherever because I wanted another go at the mantice."
Clarina Taylor laughs at Ryan Thomas.
Ryan Thomas says, "And then Jonathan's ball came about and I heard Mister Kelsey
made the news."
Clarina Taylor smiles.
Keegan Wantz says, "I would very much like to destroy that Mantis."
Clarina Taylor says, "Not the ball."
Ryan Thomas says, "So I checked and he stole the desert table and gave it to
orphens."
Clarina Taylor asks, "WAs it the ball?"
Ryan Thomas says, "Dessert, even."
Ryan Thomas nods to Clarina Taylor.
Ryan says to Clarina, "I think so."
Keegan Wantz says, "Yeah, he yoinked the desserts."
Clarina Taylor says, "It was something fancy. That's where you gave my my ring."
Keegan Wantz says, "If I recall correctly."
Ryan Thomas nods.
Ryan Thomas says, "I'm pretty sure it was the ball."
Ryan Thomas says, "But anyway. I just, and still can't, bring myself to hate the
guy after that."
Keegan Wantz says, "There's still plenty to dislike."
Ryan Thomas says, "I have no doubt."
Ryan Thomas says, "But that one thing. I'll always respect him for that."
Keegan Wantz nods.
Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Wait...he stole desserts?"
Ryan Thomas nods.
Clarina Taylor says, "Big ass cake."
Ryan Thomas says, "A whole table of them."
Keegan Wantz says, "Gave it to orphans."
Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, that's...kinda nice."
Ryan Thomas nods.
Keegan Wantz says, "He also routinely attacks and injures our merchants."
Keegan Wantz shrugs.
Ryan Thomas nods.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "That is rude as hell."
Clarina Taylor says, "It is rude."
Ryan Thomas says, "And he needs to get his for that, and the mantice."
Keegan says to Hawthorn, "So! How'd you almost burn down that kitchen?"
Ryan Thomas says, "But he does things like that. Gives dessert to orphens,
helped us fight off IFS and outsiders..."
Ryan Thomas says, "But yes."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "So I was fifteen. Mom had to go into town to get supplies
for the B and B, and so it was just me and my sisters."
Blake Madison says to Ryan, "He's a very interesting character. The whole
Takana... incident proved that for me."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Of course she tells me I'm on cook duty, and my family is
known for doing good burgers. I mean I knew how to flip a burger since I was
ten, but you know. I've never managed a whole grill of them, by myself when
they're not there and it's just my sisters."
Hawthorn Dunn blinks.
Hawthorn says to Blake Madison, "Takana incident?"
Blake Madison says to Hawthorn, "Mm mmm keep going."
Hawthorn rubs his face with the knuckles of his hand. "Uh, right. So, anyway. My
sister usually handled customers and it was my parents and I in the kitchen. I
usually washed dishes. But that day, it was just me and as soon as she leaves we
get a rush."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "So, We manage it and everything, and all, and there's so
many burgers and a couple of steaks, and I keep having to run aroand look for
the rolls cause everyone's real hungry that day."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "And so finally my sisters are about as frantic as I am, and
one of the burgers gets way burnt, and I don't smell it until gets to the point
where the grease trap goes up. We had like this old set up, real unsafe, think
my parents got a fine or something for it. Had to get a new grill and smoke
damage but. Yup it's like a cookout roasting hotdogs, save for it's in a kitchen
and its a grill."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "FWOOSH!"
Clarina Taylor says, "Indeed."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Yup. Like mini mushroom cloud. Smoke everywhere, like I'm
scrambling for the fire extinguisher, my sisters are calling me dipshit. Good
times."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Keegan Wantz says, "Let's see.."
Keegan Wantz strides north.
Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.
Keegan Wantz says, "Almost done charging."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "My sisters still call me dipshit, when I do see them,
though we don't talk much these days."
Keegan Wantz grins at Hawthorn Dunn.
Keegan Wantz strides north.

Hawthorn Dunn presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies
it for a moment.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Onward!"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as
it begins to turn.
You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.
The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the
water.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Nah, they fell off a long time ago."
Hawthorn Dunn navigates his slate blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy
application and peers at the screen.
Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.
Keegan Wantz strides north.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Gonna offset for about 15% of the charge."
Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Yup! Gotcha."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Then we'll have almost seven and a half days of charge to
get home."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Should be plenty, if we don't hit a calm."
Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.
Keegan Wantz strides north.
Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.
Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Think we can get back faster if
Ather uses his chart thing since we're not uh... gonna be zigging and zagging?"
Hawthorn Dunn waves.
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Charts have a finite range, it's only
about as much range as the short range NDB."
Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right, but as soon as we get in that range I mean..."
Hawthorn Dunn shrugs.
Keegan Wantz nods.
Keegan Wantz says, "Won't be for a bit."
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Gonna take a quick shower, back in a bit!"
Hawthorn Dunn waves.
Keegan Wantz says, "Keep an eye out for more patrols, we're not out of the woods
yet."

Keegan Wantz says, "I noticed."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Keegan Wantz asks, "Did everyone enjoy my silly tales?"
Keegan Wantz applauds sedately.
Blake Madison says, "Absolutely."
Blake says to Keegan, "Where did you get the ships from?"
Keegan Wantz says, "Icy, I think."
Keegan Wantz says, "I didn't ask for them, in either case, but I think they were
a nice touch."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Blake Madison grins.
Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares
into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive
squid propels itself away from the starship.
The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and
purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.
Keegan Wantz says, "I like this one."

Keegan Wantz says, "Reminds me of space creatures."
Keegan Wantz yawns.
Keegan Wantz says, "With all that excitement earlier, gonna take a relatively
short nap."
Ryan Thomas says, "Space squids."
Ryan Thomas exclaims, "So much excitement!"
Keegan Wantz says, "Wake me up in a few hours if I'm not alive by then."

Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

[PA] Ather Jammoa: "I shall hold down the fort. Wait, are we in a fooh, no,
we're inside of a submarine right now."
Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he sighs.
Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Hold down the fort!"
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Indeed!"
Keegan Wantz strides north.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily rubs her eyes.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

[PA] Ather Jammoa: "Oh uh I mena, lovely animals."
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yes my glorious fishes and anyone
elses."
Clarina Taylor switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "She was going to go shortsheet your bed

The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into

you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no
atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large
floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Blake Madison: "Gotcha."
The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the
launch tube, then deployed.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.
Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares
into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive
squid propels itself away from the starship.
The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and
purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.
A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric
blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.
A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous
blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as
a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Yo, who all's awake?"
The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.
The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.
Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.
The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and
closing. It then abruptly swims off.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the
drain, obscuring your vision.
The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
The monkey drops down to a lower branch.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Riftstorm."
[PA] Matteo Hapta: "What shall we do about it."

A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Morning."
A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other,
then places it back on the conveyor belt.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Location."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Veil of pride?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Probably artis, want to bring us in?"

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "It's baaack!"
You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the
entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
Listen. You need to be careful.
It's not always about where you're going.

[PA] Simon Collins: "That was... enlightning."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I think they meant okay?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Nah, might've just been OH."
Remember what I said.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Oh."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Alright I have to doze off for a couple hours just so
everyone knows."
The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

The ship drifts over a pool of blood, with many people wading through to fight
with each other.
The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to
swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in,
obscuring your vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb
slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.
The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening,
and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,

Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency
ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless
mist.

The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something

Two massive hands reach down and pick up the fishbowl, jostling and sloshing
everything inside.
The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.
There's a strong bump from beneath the fishbowl as it is placed in a new
location. The hands which were carrying it fade away.
The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the
drain, obscuring your vision.

The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.
The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly
emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the
dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you
from their seats.
The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness
gives way to swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as
one, finding a new updraft.
[PA] Matteo Hapta: "Repairs?"
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Yeah."
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Hurray. Airlock people."
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Come one come all."
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Where's everyone."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Here."
[PA] Blake Madison: "Right here."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Yup there's no debris out there so it can be readily
assumed... that nobody is out ther!"
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Let's hope that after cakes worms will not try to take
revenge from us."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Hey buddy where'd you buy that Haze!"
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into
the ship.
The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb
slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.
The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening,
and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something
within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into

The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as

[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Haze? Where?"
The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

A giant spider dashes up to the hovertruck bed, coming from behind at terrible
speed. It crawls over you quickly and disappears into the distance.
Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the
air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.
The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They
whirl off into the sky.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I'm alive!"
Small, bioluminescent alien insects flit above the grass, flashing bright purple
hues.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Be back."
The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They
whirl off into the sky.
The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.
A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in,
obscuring your vision.
The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as

The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.
A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming
countless mouths, gasping for relief.
You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.
The stage lights flicker briefly.
The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness
gives way to swirling mist.
Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Who's up?"
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.
Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped

A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally just shifting mists.

[PA] Clarina Taylor: "Woo."
[PA] Ryan Thomas: "Beep beep."
The ship jerks slightly as the ant carrying it turns abruptly to avoid marching
over a stone.
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over
an overturned tree.
The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Might need to adjust the heading!"
Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around
them.

[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Closing in!"
[PA] Alko Delovega: "Yeah."
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all
directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the
depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Oh."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Hm?"
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Oh just being..."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "790 light-years to go, for the record."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Just?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Yeah, we've made really good time in the past twenty four
hours."
[PA] Alko Delovega: "I can travel them in like 6 hours max."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Well that's pretty decent as we did travel a goodly distance
then."
Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he laughs.
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Er wait."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "I really couldn't keep very good track on this trip so how far
did we actually manage before we decided to turn back?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "We hit the Outsider patrol at about 7% NDB."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Oh right."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "And have been heading back since, due to battery more than
anything."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Yeah understand as all of that yellow killed our extra charge
but beats the alternative."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "It's been a productive trip. There's a nice collection in the
box in there."
[PA] Lily Kaise: "I also so appreciate coing along. I just wish I could be more
available but your crew is awesome Keegan. I appreciate too the opportunity to
have gotten a change of routine for a bit."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Cheers."
Lily Kaise glides in from the east.
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Good day everybody, it's time for me to
waste a cycle and a half or so of precious time on sleep. Fly safe!"
Lily Kaise pulls a pair of mystic purple suede clogs off of her feet.

dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.
A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.
The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.
A white bird flashes by over the plain.
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to
swirling mist.
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
The breeze abruptly changes direction, causing the tall grass to stir slightly.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the
launch tube, then deployed.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Ever been to a field like this, Gonzales?"
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Do you want to grab that artifact, Gonz, or neg?"
Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on
it.

[PA] Simon Collins: "Is there a reason we're artifacting here?"
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Grabbing a souvenier for Gonzales."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "As it's his first trip, pretty sure."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Want one?"
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Back."
[PA] Simon Collins: "Na, its fine."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Onwards!"
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on
it and goes to sleep.
You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the
window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "720 light-years from home."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Because of course the flow plays nicer on the way back, ha."
The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later,
it emerges again and all is back to normal.
Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.
A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you
finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you
finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.
Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene
to formless mist.
Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I'm awake."
Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.
A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.
Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

Lily Kaise glides out.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally just shifting mists.
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.
The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.
An insectile chittering echoes from the distance.
A row of perfectly ordered oval cocoons move past a window.
The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along
with yours.
An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a
high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a plain white spacesuit helmet, a plain white spacesuit top, a
pair of plain white spacesuit gloves, a plain white spacesuit bottom, and a pair
of plain white spacesuit boots. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag
with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a
metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone
holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a spacesuit navaid, and a reactionless spacesuit jet. Her face,
both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.
She is carrying a hyperspanner in her right hand, and a manual zero-point energy
receptacle charger in her left hand.
