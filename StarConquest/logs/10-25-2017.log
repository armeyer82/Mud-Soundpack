02:00 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

04:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:00 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
