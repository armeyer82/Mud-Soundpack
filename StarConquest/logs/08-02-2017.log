00:02:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

00:02:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:02:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:02:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:05:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:05:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:05:18 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:05:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Emperial Collector, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:05:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:05:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:05:47 There are no other ships in this sector.

00:05:52 The ship is already in that sector.

00:23:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:23:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:23:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:23:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:24:21 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:24:21 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

00:24:22 There appear to be about 14 pilots recently active.

00:24:23 The communicator network detects:
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey  (A) [g]
Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident  (A) [m]

Your communicator also reports that there are 4 pilots who were active but dropped out of communications.
Additionally, there are 13 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 27 pilots.

00:42:01 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:42:01 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:42:04 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

00:42:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Emperial Collector, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

00:42:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:42:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:42:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

00:42:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:42:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:42:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:43:31 The ship is already in that sector.

Help on: Sight-commands
-----------------------
In recent months, a large number of visually impaired players have joined Star Conquest, and in order to make the game more comfortable and accessible for them, we have added a few very helpful commands that many other players may also find extremely useful.

SIGHT (S I G H T): The SIGHT command has actually been a part of the game for a couple of years. Basically this command removes the 'visual' element from starmaps, screening out a lot of the gibberish that serves only to annoy and distract visually impaired players while their screen readers frantically recite dozens of dashes. It also does things like remove all but the ships you have keys to from the TRANSPORT menu in garages so that screen readers aren't scrambling to recite five million ship names. Most recently, this command also adjusts damage reports in starships to only list the damaged components, eliminating unnecessary extra spam. Overall, this is a very handy command.

BRIEF (B R I E F):  The BRIEF command makes it so that when you're walking around, room descriptions will not be displayed unless you specifically request to see it by using the LOOK command.

FOCUS (F O C U S): The FOCUS command is a combat command which allows you to focus on a single ship during combat instead of getting a huge list of ships to sort through. You'll be given a list of ships to choose from, and your weapons room will foc
00:53:33 us on that ship until you either use the FOCUS command again, or until the ship has been destroyed.

QUIET (Q U I E T): Finally, the QUIET command, though not specifically intended for blind players, is very helpful in cutting out starship spam. This command will only work in the starship you're currently in, and only in the control room. The starship will stay in quiet mode until you change it.

We hope these commands are helpful to our visually impaired players. We ask that our other players be understanding. If you come across a player who spells things very oddly, it's likely not their fault as they can't see the letters and can only hear how the words sound. Helping them in private with spelling can be very beneficial to everyone, as long as you do it nicely.

Enter the number of the sector you wish to travel to.

00:56:32 That isn't a valid selection.

00:56:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

00:56:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:56:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:56:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:56:57    Space Stations:

---------------------------------------------------------

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

00:57:02 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

00:57:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:57:07 There is 1 player connected:

00:57:07 Rolando Caganda  (A) [n]                             

00:57:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:57:13 Would you like to request docking clearance for The Torus (Dock Alpha)?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

00:57:15 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

00:57:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Emperial Collector.  The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:57:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:57:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:57:35 [Starship "Emperial Collector"; Airlock]

00:57:35 You can go out and into the ship.

00:57:36 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]

00:57:36 The three-person heavy cruiser "Refracted Reality", the one-person marauder "Optic Nerve", the two-person syphon "Mentally Drained", the two-person asteroid hauler "Smells Like Cheese", the one-person flitter "Back To Basics", the one-person flitter "Typical", and the two-person salvager "Emperial Collector" are docked here.
You see Larry the droid, Erika the droid, a shiny blue medical drone, a spherical security drone, a spherical security drone, and a rhesus monkey here.
You can go north, east, west, and down.

00:57:45 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]

00:57:46 The Torus docking bays consist of sterile silver-colored walls, floor, and ceiling. Somehow, even with people coming and going constantly, the floor is kept completely clean. An unknown technology allows the docking bay to remain open to space while holding air. You see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star outside. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility is to the east, and the starship supply store is to the west.

00:57:58 You see a long counter, a trash can, a peace treaty, and a soft-backed elk here.
You can go east.

00:58:01 [The Torus; Torus Restaurant]

00:58:02 A long stainless plexsteel counter is manned by a bartender/waiter droid. Stools line the counter, providing seating for those who choose to stay and eat.

01:00:28 [The Torus Mall; Timed Weaponry]

01:00:28 You stand within the infamous timed weaponry shop, which sells fusion and EMP charges intended to be attached to an enemy ship's hull by a spacewalker. Diagrams explain how to SET a charge's timer, and then USE the charge once the user is floating above the target's hull. The charges on display seem to be nearly featureless discs covered with a thick plastic coating, with a magnetic pad on one side. Some are shaped to intensify damage done to a specific component, or unshaped in order to simply affect whichever component is closest.
You can go east.

01:00:40 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You do that and I'll consider wearing them."

01:01:19 [The Torus Tesla Branch]

01:01:19 You stand inside a branch of the Tesla Planetary Salvage Consortium. A sign explains about the presence of a moon near a gas giant circling Betelgeuse, a moon so hostile that even a spacesuited human cannot survive. It was discovered that this moon, dubbed Teslaworld, was permeated with tunnels filled with valuable mineral deposits, as well as a large number of artifacts from some alien species who had occupied the moon previously. Now, Teslaworld is explored and mined safely by teleoperated drones. If you wish to assist in this endeavour, ask a Teslaworld representative if you may REGISTER.

01:02:00 [The Torus; Novelty Discs]

01:02:00 This is where people from all over the First Thirty come to get their motionless plastic novelty discs. Several signs explain that the legend goes that the first human members of the EAOS wanted simple souveniers to give to their friends and family, and decided upon plastic models of the Torus. However, unable to sufficiently communicate their ideas to the alien EAOS members, they ended up with simple discs instead. This explanation seems rather unlikely; but still, the plastic discs endure.

01:02:08 [The Torus; Temporary Structures]

01:02:08 This store looks to be fairly new, which would make sense since temporary space structures are a new invention. They can be bought here at what go for reasonable prices for use in space. A middle aged salesperson waits for your order.

01:02:49 The main concourse consists of a hollow cylinder, curved until its ends join; the same shape as the Torus itself. Large banks of windows display the dark vacuum outside, punctuated by pinpricks of starlight. The EAOS either makes very strong windows, or is willing to sacrifice structual integrity for scenery.

Lacy white curtains look out onto a green atrium outside being tended to by robot arms. The quaint tables and chairs in the main dining area are engraved with a pattern that, upon close inspection, turns out to be a representation of a herd of elk. All HyperTea locations are hyperspatially linked, allowing you to interact with people and objects regardless of what HyperTea they're in.

01:06:49 [The Torus; Novelty Discs]

01:06:49 This is where people from all over the First Thirty come to get their motionless plastic novelty discs. Several signs explain that the legend goes that the first human members of the EAOS wanted simple souveniers to give to their friends and family, and decided upon plastic models of the Torus. However, unable to sufficiently communicate their ideas to the alien EAOS members, they ended up with simple discs instead. This explanation seems rather unlikely; but still, the plastic discs endure.

01:25:42 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:25:43 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

Help on: Meetings
-----------------
Meeting Policies
----------------
   Meetings in Star Conquest, as described here, are in-character gatherings of players, to discuss the storyline, choose a course of action, or change alliance policy.  Most are announced ahead of time, though not necessarily via a means requiring host intervention.  They are often considered IC events, even when involving only players, and policy dictates that participants act as such.
   During a meeting, some may wish to alter alliance policy or decide on some major course of action.  This will require a vote, and there are certain requirements in place which a vote must meet to result in an official decision:

     * A motion to be voted upon must be explicitly put forth and then seconded.

     * A quorum is five players of each alliance for which a decision is being made.  (If an alliance has fewer than nine members, a quorum is three.)  Each player's character must have existed for 10 days or more to be considered part of a quorum.  A quorum of four may be approved with a vote, with power to veto awarded to the alliance leader as well as any other alliances present.

     * An official representative (leader or diplomat) from each alliance for which a decision is being made must witness the vote.  This representative has power of veto.

     * A reasonable time must exist since any other vote involving the same issue.

   Although pl
01:36:18 ayers may call any vote they wish, no official decision will be reached nor any official action taken until and unless a vote occurs with these requirements fulfilled.
   Also note that representatives are real human beings and may not be able to attend for OOC reasons, or may also be unavailable for IC reasons.  If this is the case, the caller of the meeting may cancel, reschedule, or go without; however, the requirements above are always in place.  Representatives are not required in order to meet, but only to hold an official vote.
   The caller of the meeting may also choose to have whatever information he or she wishes placed in the orders of all involved alliances.  Other methods of spreading the word are generally left up to the player.  However, if a representative is present, that representative may send a reminder over the comm at the time of the meeting.
   Any player is allowed to request a meeting; there are no requirements based on age or points.  However, a request may be denied for any IC or OOC reason.  If you wish to request a meeting, please type MEETING-REQUEST.

02:30:57 Lileah Rose says, "well m maybe not heh"

02:30:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ares class warship at 777."

02:31:02 Lileah Rose sits down on a large leather lounge couch.

02:31:06 You chuckle.

02:31:21 Lileah Rose grins.

02:31:30 I can't find "chair."

02:31:32 I can't find "sofa."

02:31:34 You sit down on a large leather lounge couch.

02:31:35 You say, "ok"

02:31:36 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:31:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:31:38 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Awww."

02:31:38 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:31:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Emperial Collector, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:31:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:31:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:32:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:32:02 [Starship "Emperial Collector"; Control Room]

02:32:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:32:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:32:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:34:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Get it!"

02:34:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:34:03 You say, "I know where."

02:36:51 Lileah Rose asks, "do you have a currency converter?"

02:36:54 You say, "I thought it was here."

02:36:58 You say, "Nope"

02:37:00 You peer north...

02:37:00 
[The Torus; Dock Beta]
The Torus docking bays consist of sterile silver-colored walls, floor, and ceiling. Somehow, even with people coming and going constantly, the floor is kept completely clean. An unknown technology allows the docking bay to remain open to space while holding air. A rare starship supply store is to the south.
The one-person cargo hauler "Hauler9300" is docked here.
You see a standard banana dispenser, a standard milk dispenser, and Ignignot the droid here.

You can go north, east, west, and down.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:39:19 Some lights on the two-person salvager "Emperial Collector" suddenly flash several times.

02:39:19 [Starship "Emperial Collector"; Airlock]
You can go out and into the ship.
Lileah Rose followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:39:22 [Starship "Emperial Collector"; Control Room]

02:39:22 You see a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:39:23 Lileah Rose removes an FTL drive tracer from a handbag.

02:39:26 You grin.

02:40:05 Lileah Rose carefully sets about bolting a sector debris scanner to a convenient surface.

02:40:08 Lileah Rose says, "there"

02:40:10 You sit down on a large leather lounge couch.

02:40:13 Lileah Rose sits down on a large leather lounge couch.

02:40:15 You grin.

02:40:16 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:40:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Emperial Collector, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:40:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:40:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:40:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:40:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:40:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:40:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:40:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

02:40:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:41:31 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:41:34 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

02:41:39 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

02:41:42 Lileah Rose laughs.

02:41:42 Storage hold contents:

02:41:43 
Name:                                     Units:

Remaining weight capacity:              = 1181


02:41:44 Lileah Rose says, "wow"

02:41:47 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

02:41:49 You say, "oh"

02:41:52 Lileah Rose says, "oh"

02:41:54 You exclaim, "I need to transfer!"

02:41:56 You laugh.

02:42:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:42:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:42:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:42:13 Lileah Rose says, "you have a ball of neutronium which almost fills the entire hold Love"

02:42:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:42:16 Lileah Rose laughs.

02:42:18 You laugh.

02:42:23 Lileah Rose exclaims, "it is huuuuuuge!"

02:42:30 You say, "Yeah"

02:42:34 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

02:42:38 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

02:42:44 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

02:42:50 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:42:50 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

02:42:51 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

02:42:53 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:42:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Emperial Collector.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:42:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:43:05 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 139,547.83 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

02:43:06 Lileah Rose exclaims, "I don't htink i've ever seen a piece of debris that large! ... ever!"

02:43:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:43:10 You laugh.

02:43:13 Storage hold contents:

02:43:13 
[1] a ball of neutronium

Enter the number of the object you would like to transfer.

02:43:14 Lileah Rose laughs.

02:43:15 You hear metallic scraping as the transfer of the cargo begins.

02:43:17 The sounds from the ship's hold cease as the cargo finishes transferring.

02:43:17 You have been credited with 361067.93 AEU credits for your find.

02:43:24 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

02:43:25 Current overall point level: 41
Current combat point level: 0

02:43:27 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:43:29 Lileah Rose asks, "how much for that monster?"

02:43:32 Lileah Rose laughs.

02:43:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Emperial Collector, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:43:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:43:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:43:52 You say, "361K"

02:43:56 I don't understand that.

02:43:57 Lileah Rose says, "haha"

02:44:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:44:00 You laugh.

02:44:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

Three-Dimensional Space

   Many players are familiar with Star Conquest's old 2D space, which was represented solely by what is now the X-Y map.  This help file is intended to acclimate these older players to the new third axis, and to give new players the basics of navigation.
   First, although 3D space can of course be visualized in any orientation, one specific orientation is emphasized by the game to simplify navigation.  Many find it helpful to think of it like this:

     1. Your Z-coordinate ("height" on the X-Z map) is your "level."  Every other point in space with the same Z-coordinate is on your level.  Incidentally, each level is equivalent to the old 2D starmap.
     2. Now imagine ten such levels, stacked one atop the other.  The X-Y map, then, looks "down" upon this stack from the top.  Each level is, of course, transparent, until an object blocks everything directly below it.  Thus, you are looking down through all ten levels.  Your numeric keypad moves you in any of the eight compass directions on this level.
     3. The X-Z map shows this same stack from one side, oriented toward the Y-axis.  It might be useful to use this map simply to determine which level you are on, and then use the X-Y map to determine where you are on that level.

05:58:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't actually fight off the pirates though."

05:58:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Would it be possible to dock a couple of FTL-less fighters at the recharge rest station? Could use them to defend the area against these guys."

05:59:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That would be tricky, those stations are only temporary and have to be replaced everyso often."

05:59:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So if they go down with fighters inside, the fighters will be ejcted into space with no one on them and be easy picking."

06:00:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The recharge rest station had like, twenty days of life span last I checked."

06:00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's why I suggested that one."

06:00:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, but it's still tricky to have to redock the fighters when the station goes down. It's not a bad idea, just a tricky one."

06:01:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "These Lasers aren't that strong, are they?"

06:02:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're decent, it's that there's only one turret."

06:02:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The short ranged ones are actually quite strong."

06:02:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No one ever seems to use those, though."

06:02:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Pirates are gone."

06:13:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I don't."

06:14:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, watch yo<rself around those bolt thro=ers. T&ey have a ?ong ]ange weapon them, well, it's not that long of a range,#but it can take {ur your drive in one shot."

06:14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, I'll exp'ain better when my co$msa a}en't g#rbeled."

06:14:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I could make one, but im lacking some circuit boards and some chassis."

06:14:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nah, I understand."

06:15:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "As long as they}didn't hit you with it, +ou sho,ld be fine."

06:15:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Theres a repair station here, too."

06:15:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, right. I forgot about$that."

06:15:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, the Bolt th;}wers have a weapon called the bolt +annon. It can't hit y`ur hull,  but .t does incredible dama:e =o weapons and drives depending on the t}pes of bolts they use."

06:16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Often one bolt will ta\e out your drive in o*e )hot."

06:16:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sounds like a support-role style craft."

06:18:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Garbled comms [re the|best! They make you sound all weird a{d s\uff1."

06:24:08 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "The one lady liked it for sure."

06:24:54 [General Communication] Eli, Fomoir of legend transmits, "Oh my god.. I came all the way out here to tug "Not a Target Drone" To safety. I get here and just as I'm about to reach the ship in the secotr, it suddenly leave."

06:26:05 [General Communication] Eli, Fomoir of legend transmits, "Ugh, what a waste of time."

06:26:54 [General Communication] Mister Kelsey transmits, "A shame indeed."

06:27:02 [General Communication] Eli, Fomoir of legend transmits, "Well, whoever that is, I'm glad you are ok at least."

06:27:23 [General Communication] Eli, Fomoir of legend transmits, "Oh no.. Not the Kelsey."

06:28:53 [General Communication] Eli, Fomoir of legend transmits, "It's ok, Just glad it's alright."

06:28:57 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "I coudln't land, so I went a sector out."

06:29:10 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah I found you out here just idling."

06:29:39 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "I'm ok guys, sorry again, I feel so bad..."

06:30:09 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's good. The fact that you're okay is the main thing."

06:30:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli, Fomoir of legend transmits, "He's.. well, he's Kelsey. He's a bad guy for sure, but he's also fought on our side before."

06:30:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And he's definitely a criminal mastermind."

06:31:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "His pirates have made whole space warehouses disappear without a trace."

06:31:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And he always leaves behind polite little notes, and sometimes gives what he steals to children and such. He's a hard one ot figure out."

06:32:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wow, so he's kind of hard to perdict too. A dangerous enemy but capable ally."

06:32:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like he stole the cake from the resitance anniversary party, but then turned around and gave it to children."

06:32:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Bet those kids were happy!"

06:32:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wouldn't exactly call him an ally, but yeah, /e's helped turn the tide of a battle or two."

06:33:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well. When it comes to humanity the outsiders are public enemy number one. They won't relaly discriminate, yknow?"

06:33:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's just a good thing you ar) alright, based on that little communication,  it sounds like a particular some*ne might have had an eye on the ship."

06:35:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Exactly. He certainly realizes that the IFS an? Outsiders .re a threat to him'as well."

06:35:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There was even once when a ton of people went o%t on expiditions, that he;announced h# would defend huma] s`ace until thei, return. As soon as the/ did though it was |ack to business as usual."

06:36:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And, never attack them in Mutuality space unless you are attacked first. They hav? a n'n-aggression pact }ith them."

06:37:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hmm. Makes me wonder what this man is motivated by. Hi, Vernos."

06:37:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There are some that could tell you. I know he u>ed to be Fringe at s@m. point."

06:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And I've hea;d )e believes in things%like the government be|n+ fo_ the p>ople and [uch, but |e also seems to believ? in blowing up our s_ips and ste,ling o?r resources[ ETc."

06:38:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He's >ctually kind @f a gentlemen when he spea.s over comms or fro_ his;flagship."

06:41:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "U`h, 4% minutes u~ti> I get b,~k."

06:41:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Perhaps he antagonizes the alliances because he doesn't believe their government do what they should."

06:41:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "777 shouldnt extremely shitty."

06:41:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He certain|y feels that%way(abo}t "he Fringe."

06:57:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eliza Flores transmits, "I'll try it again. I couldn't find a beacon for it on my list."

06:58:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hello AEU!"

06:58:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, that only shows nearby beacons, Centurai might be further away."

06:59:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're carrying us! Check out the conquest results."

06:59:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "O-oh. How'd I manage that?"

07:00:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "By doing a lot of great salvaging."

07:00:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Huh."

07:00:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I really should consider doing more of that."

07:01:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The belt of orion is a great place once you've got a decent grade grapple."

07:05:58 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Salvage! Salvage!"

07:06:05 [General Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

07:06:05 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Why am I still awake!"

07:06:24 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "If you are a kind person you will not let me press this comm button again."

07:06:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Do it. Press the button."

07:06:53 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Noooo..."

07:07:03 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "No, not just one. ALL the buttons."

07:08:07 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Should have topped off my ship's charge sooner. Its going to take a half hour."

07:09:04 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eve, would you mind doing me a huge favor?"

07:09:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you say anything about stations...I think I will cry."

07:09:23 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes, Con?"

07:09:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh no."

07:09:29 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well..."

07:10:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I built a home beacon 776 but I fell asleep in my ship for a long time and missed the expiration of the old one."

07:10:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Go put it up, I will label it."

07:10:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's on Herding Cats, would you mind pushing it out? I only ask because I'm already out at 777."

07:11:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I can't fly a uh...that thing."

07:11:29 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought you put a part on it for me the other day."

07:11:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I'm thinking of someone else."

07:11:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sure, when I bought it. But I can't launch a constructor."

07:11:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

07:12:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am not AEU."

07:12:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It will have to wait until Shule wakes up then, I guess."

07:12:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um..."

07:13:01 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, No return trip?"

07:13:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How hopelessly lost will I get trying to rift back without it?"

07:13:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You might. If I had someone who could help me launch it, I'd gladly do it."

07:13:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli, you don't have a key to herding cats, do you?"

07:14:00 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "It's a pretty much straight shot at 325 -5."

07:14:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or Vernos?"

07:14:37 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It'll take time though. But beacons are pretty important to put up in time. I'm not yelling at you. But yeah. If you're in doubt. Put it up early."

07:14:55 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "She's yelling at you."

07:15:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I...am not?"

07:15:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I know. I don't know happened. I couldn't keep my eyes open."

07:15:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm mildly frustrated, but..."

07:15:20 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Not enough coffee?"

07:16:01 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So supposing I rift back manually, how do I know when to drop out?"

07:16:19 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You will need to make an approach to the beacon."

07:16:19 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do I just monitor the locations until I see the Mir beacon? Will that show up?"

07:16:43 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yeah, it's just like making your approach anywhere, you will see the beacon, and probably a couple temp beacons."

07:17:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

07:17:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Now...If he'd built these many times, I'd be typical Evenia pissed. But because he hasn't...I'm mildly frustrated."

07:17:15 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Temporary Station at Home Beacon Alpha 776 is now on emergency power.

07:18:05 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry everyone!"

07:18:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

07:18:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Run back now, then. You have an hour."

07:18:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Run run run."

07:19:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But trust me. It makes your life so much easier. If you build beacons earlier. Rather than later. If you're late. I'll gladly come label it for you."

07:20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "This is going to be one long trip back.."

07:20:44 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might be a little late. The rift is blowing right in my face, but I'll have a couple minutes when I come out."

07:20:48 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll let you know."

07:21:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's not a problem at all. I'll come label it if you are."

07:21:13 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yep its a 55ish minute trip back to 776."

07:21:49 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Is there an autolander at 776?"

07:22:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If only. None of us have 6000 command."

07:22:15 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Ah."

07:32:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I'll have i, set up long before you get back."

07:32:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "\}irty six minutes. Im&slowly gainin" speed."

07:32:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ok"y, good."

07:36:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, ";on."

07:37:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm?"

07:37:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Would it be p~ssible to hold a %alvage op-ration at 777?,Or !oes the distance make it hard;"

07:38:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's defi,i@ely possible. Now t[at we have more peo]le }e `hould de|initely look in{=,it. I-think 2-0 might]be an even better place for $t."

07:39:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, it'd be & grea` way -o encourage team effort!"

07:40:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh g[ez, what wa- that noise? It sounded like a gurg,e."

07:44:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Woah. T.irty in%ustry points worth of salvage."

07:45:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's awesome!"

07:46:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh nice! You're working fast."

07:46:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Woo."

07:49:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "So, how bad of an idea would it be to attempt flying in Zero-G?"

07:50:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Don't we normally fly in Zero-g? Its space.."

07:50:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, are you talking about having no artificial gravity in your ship?"

07:50:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Artificial gravity, I'm speaking. Turns out ships are programmed to throw a fit if you try."

07:50:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't know you could control that."

07:51:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You can trip the breaker for the gravity to float around inside."

07:51:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

07:51:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hah, what did your ship say?"

07:51:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't speak machine. But I imagine it was a slur of obscenities."

07:51:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

07:53:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oof. Okay, I don't recommend tripping that breaker. The fall down to the deck is really difficult to predict."

08:03:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's everyone up to?"

08:03:58 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Just getting back from 777 in a few minutes."

08:04:09 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Rushing to replace 776!"

08:04:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Staring at a bulkhead."

08:05:08 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Thrilling."

08:05:17 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Trying to beat 776 before it goes down."

08:05:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You should beat it handily, I'll have it up in about three minutes."

08:05:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If it drops before you guys make it, I'll be there to label it. I just can't remember if it's alpha or beta."

08:06:11 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alpha."

08:07:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I figured the Libs folks were still in their meeting. The longest meeting ever known."

08:07:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It was. It was like...2 hours."

08:07:59 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What did you meet about?"

08:08:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It was supposed to take like half an hour, if that."

08:27:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Do I got time to take my scout to the old frontier drydock? Got to buy a new battery."

08:27:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can't dock there until we clear the vents."

08:27:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You won't be able to dock."

08:27:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's one reason we need to clear the vents."

08:28:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In fact you should, that's what it's there for."

08:29:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't really know what you're talking about. Tier 1 suits are cheap anyhow."

08:29:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it's there if you want it."

08:30:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Agh. I forgot that I have my suit off-planet currently. One moment."

08:37:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Okay, plasma suit is up and running."

08:37:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I didn't get the battle of mir curse today. This makes me happy."

08:38:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is that when you get a salvage mission in battle of mir and it sucks because there's so few chunks in each sector?"

08:38:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is."

08:38:20 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man, I hate that."

08:38:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's a total bitch for the IFS wrecks."

08:38:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah it is."

08:38:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why?"

08:38:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, nevermind."

08:39:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. Because there's shipwrecks around there. And there's only one chunk in each sector. So it takes you like...10 sectors at least."

08:39:57 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Only thing I've ever found out there are gloves of spacemen not to be seen again."

08:40:09 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Granted, I've not poked around much."

08:40:09 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh eli, be excited. Your favorite thing is now on my org menu."

08:43:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Really, really wish I could get that merchant-grade storage compression system..."

08:44:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rhino would have 59500 units of cargo space with it."

08:44:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd like to find anything but asteroids when I'm out salvaging, myself."

08:44:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Whats the best grapple you can get?"

08:44:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure."

08:45:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The biggest I had before I got rogued was mighty grapple XI."

08:45:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can buy grapples with grades over 100, but I've only ever seen one chunk with a grade higher than 60."

08:46:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I haven't spent the money to upgrade to that."

08:46:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Things with that high of a grade are like, way out of comms."

08:46:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figure they're for doing salvage ops out in deep space."

08:46:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I 100% want to do."

08:46:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I saw a field of alien shipwrecks that was grade 100 but it was like 500 lightyears out."

08:47:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, nice."

08:47:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I believe it was called the Veil of Rage."

08:47:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Five hundred? Woah. That's a few days at least isn't it?"

08:48:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How'd you not run out of power?"

08:48:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are ship upgrades that generate power."

08:48:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The ship we were in had plenty of charge, and a blast furnace."

08:49:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah If I got the revo battery my scout would have thirty hours of charge, I believe."

08:49:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have the Feinstein battery on mine."

08:49:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A feinstein battery will double a ships cahrge, as well."

08:50:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er Fienstein."

08:50:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's honestly overkill though, I'm not going on any two day artifacting trips."

08:50:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe someday I will."

08:50:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oops, I meant the feinstein battery, yeah."

08:51:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Before we had temp stations. I used to just go capm out in the Radio bubble for a couple of days heh."

08:51:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any good use for that Hyperion battery?"

08:51:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Look at its max speed."

08:51:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Gotta go fast."

08:51:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not that I'm aware of, I'm sure there is somehow."

08:51:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right, but I don't think we have any engines that are that fast."

08:51:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Umm.. Look at the engines on the AEU book."

08:51:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, but none of our engines will go over 6000."

08:51:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the fastest one is 6000."

08:52:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh. Starting out you mean?"

08:52:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the benefit of the 8000 is wasted for some pretty hefy drawbacks."

08:52:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's all the battery matters for."

08:52:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe Best is toiling away developing new engine tech for us."

08:52:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

08:52:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not."

08:52:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So the extra speed capacity is wasted. I've often wondered if that extra capacity can't be utilized somehow though, perhaps having that extra does something, I've just never been able to figure out what."

08:53:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, what suit do you want me to bring Constantine?"

08:53:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "EAOS 5 perhaps?"

08:54:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or do you need a League?"

08:54:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Dakhal and I are in EAOS-1."

08:54:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We do need a league or a repair."

08:54:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm in a league 2 currently, but a 3 might be much safer."

08:54:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you use that, I'll repair."

08:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or if you want to repair, we can brace it with the League 2."

08:55:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll bring a League 5."

08:55:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'll switch to AEU then."

08:55:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If that's alright? I'm not as good at repairing? I bet we could get Evenia to come along too, she's pretty good at repairing."

08:56:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, that's fine. Sure, we can ask her. The four of us should be more than enough, though, I think."

08:56:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right on."

08:56:37 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity, the rats."

08:56:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Time to roast bari with Plasma! Any tips for dealing with the bari?"

08:56:51 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Lots of rats today, yeah."

08:57:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's fairly straightforward, basically they're resistant to everything but sonics and plasma."

08:57:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think worker hordes are fine to use lasers on."

08:57:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So do that to kind of conserve your energy."

08:57:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Everything else you'll want to use arc on."

08:57:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Alright. I happen to have a full stock of energy bottles."

10:29:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or old cluster."

10:32:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Huh."

10:32:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What happened?"

10:32:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I don't have enough industry points, the book said two hundred eighty but it needs two hundred ninety four."

10:52:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ill try my hand at asteroid mining tommorow then."

11:05:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

11:28:00 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good night!"

11:30:40 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Oh."

11:31:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hi Anfisha! I drank good times!"

11:37:39 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

11:37:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

11:46:32 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Airlock]
You can go out and into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

11:46:34 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

11:46:34 You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

11:46:35 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:46:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:46:36 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

11:46:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

11:46:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:46:51 The ship is already moving.

11:46:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:46:53 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

11:46:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:47:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:47:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:47:07 Sector 2: Empty Space (Unclaimed) [Human Interalliance Space]

11:48:22 Rolando Caganda  (A) [n]                             

11:48:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:48:24 For a top, you are wearing a grey vee-neck shirt.  For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue corduroy jeans over a pair of cotton briefs.  You have on some black leather boots.  You are also wearing a backpack, a leather briefcase, a metafrequency FTL transmitter, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, an asteroid hauling supply kit, and a standard starship flightbag.

11:48:25 You are carrying nothing.

11:48:39 I don't understand that.

11:48:39 Automatic daily maintenance is now underway. This will not affect your connectivity, but the game may feel less responsive for the next few minutes.

11:48:53 I don't understand that.

11:48:56 I don't understand that.

11:48:57 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (6, 11, 2)

11:49:01 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (6, 10, 2)

11:49:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:49:19 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

11:49:22 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

11:49:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

11:49:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:49:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:49:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:49:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:55:17 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

11:55:17 The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

12:39:34 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

12:44:35 You have been idle too long.  Have a lovely evening.
    * You have been disconnected. Please come back soon. *

12:59:02 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:59:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:59:19 Not much to see out there.

12:59:21 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:59:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:59:22 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:59:26 You peer out...

12:59:26 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Windflight", the one-person flitter "Roundabout", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.

You can go north, south, west, and down.

12:59:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:59:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:59:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:59:39 Which sector did you mean?

12:59:39 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

12:59:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:59:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:59:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

12:59:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:59:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:59:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:59:47 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:59:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:00:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:00:16 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:00:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

13:00:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:00:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:00:36 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:00:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:00:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:00:38 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

13:00:39 You can go out and enter into the ship.

13:00:51 You exit the ship.

13:00:51 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

13:00:52 [The Torus; Garage]

13:00:53 You can go up.

13:00:55 [Starship "Daisy May"; Airlock]

13:00:55 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, a sleeping large white unicorn felo, a large light red unicorn felo, and an obese white unicorn felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

13:00:59 a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough

13:00:59 The trough appears to be about two-thirds full.

13:01:01 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]

13:01:01 You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, a big white soldier felo, and a frisky big white soldier felo here.
You can go south and out.

13:01:07 a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl

13:01:07 The bowl is still almost entirely full.

13:01:09 [Starship "Daisy May"; Main Deck]

13:01:10 You see a small purple ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, and a big white soldier felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.
Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

13:01:15 You sniff absently at the air.

13:01:18 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]

13:01:18 You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, a big white soldier felo, and a frisky big white soldier felo here.

13:01:22 You exit the ship.

13:01:23 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

13:02:06 [The Torus; Garage]

13:02:06 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

13:02:15 [Starship "Flying Cat"; Airlock]

13:02:15 You see a row of flightlockers, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, a large light red feathered felo, and a large red soldier felo kitten here.

You can go south and out.

13:02:23 I see no "trough" here.

13:02:25 [Starship "Flying Cat"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a dark purple leather captain's chair with a sleeping big red feathered felo on it, a large oval white and light blue cloth rug, a walnut coffee table, a white leather sectional sofa with an old sleeping hefty red felo on it, an overstuffed bright cobalt blue armchair, a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy pale pink ceramic felo chow bowl, Daizey the humanoid service robot, a big white feathered felo, and a frisky hefty red felo here.

You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

13:02:40 a glossy seashell pink ceramic felo chow bowl

13:02:40 The bowl is still almost entirely full.

13:02:40 A big white feathered felo wanders in from the north.
A hefty red feathered felo wanders in from the west.

You can go south and out.

13:03:29 a glossy dark red ceramic felo chow bowl

13:53:24 Sector 16: Empty Space (AEU) [Human Interalliance Space]

13:53:24 Current coordinates: (6, 5, 2)


13:53:27 There are no other ships or debris in this sector.

13:53:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:53:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:53:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:53:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:53:56    Planets:

13:53:56 [1] New Earth

13:53:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:54:33 I don't understand that.

13:54:37 The starship is already moving.

13:54:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:54:39 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

13:54:49 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:54:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:54:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:55:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:12:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:12:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

14:12:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:12:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:12:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:31:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:31:18 There is 1 player connected:

14:32:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:32:13 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

14:32:17 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:32:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Welcome, courier ship.  You are cleared to land."

14:32:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:32:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:32:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:32:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:42:28 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

15:42:31 There is nothing in the storage hold.

15:42:31 Storage capacity: 200000 units

15:42:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:42:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:42:35 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:42:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:42:37 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

15:42:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

15:42:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:42:51 The ship is already moving.

15:42:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:42:53 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

15:42:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:42:59 There is 1 player connected:

15:43:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:43:09 Sector 20: Grenwold (neutral) [Human Interalliance Space]

15:43:09 Current coordinates: (8, 19, 7)


15:43:13 Targets in this sector:

15:43:13 
[1] Yuuijuminlakiltra (Jinu)
[2] Ouster (unregistered)
[3] Debris at 3 units

Scan which target?
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:43:22 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as another starship is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:43:32 The computer reports that the one-person salvage junker "Ouster" has jumped out of the sector.

15:43:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Yuuijuminlakiltra.

15:43:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:43:41 There is 1 player connected:

15:43:41 Rolando Caganda  (A)                                 

15:44:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:44:12 I don't understand that.

15:44:14 The Jinu starship "Yuuijuminlakiltra" has a docking bay large enough to contain this ship.  You can request entry into its docking bay, or dock in the usual manner by connecting to the docking ring near the control room.

15:44:14 Would you like to request entry into the docking bay?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

15:44:17 Request for entry into Yuuijuminlakiltra's docking bay sent.

15:44:17 Yuuijuminlakiltra accepts the entry request.

15:44:22 You feel a bit of acceleration as the ship begins docking procedures.

15:44:27 You hear a solid thud as the ship sets down in a larger ship's docking bay.

15:44:32 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Airlock]

15:44:32 You can go out and into the ship.

15:44:33 You may not leave the ship until the airlock's environment matches the external environment.

15:44:40 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit, do you wish to suit up now?

15:44:41 [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:44:42 You remove spacesuit components from a standard starship flightbag and quickly don them.

15:44:42 Unfortunately, you're still not fully suited.

15:44:46 You remove some black leather boots from your feet.

15:44:50 You put some black leather boots in a leather briefcase.

15:44:54 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit, do you wish to unsuit now?

15:44:55 [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:44:56 You remove the elements of your spacesuit and fold them neatly into a standard starship flightbag.

15:44:57 I don't understand that.

15:44:59 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit, do you wish to suit up now?

15:44:59 [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:45:00 You remove spacesuit components from a standard starship flightbag and quickly don them.

15:45:03 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

15:45:06 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

15:45:08 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow.  Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

15:45:18 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

15:45:20 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

15:45:22 [Hukiltra "Yuuijuminlakiltra"; Tfysa oh Dmku]

15:45:22 The two-person light freighter "Sandbagger" is parked here.
You see a helpful sign, Ketchup the droid, Ron the droid, and Jenn the droid here.
You can go north.

15:45:24 You can't go that way.

15:45:27 [Hukiltra "Yuuijuminlakiltra"; Ortfysa]

15:45:32 [Hukiltra "Yuuijuminlakiltra"; Jukte Lili Jolii Ske Mununtra]

15:45:32 You can go south.
You are greeted by one of the Jinu.  It regards you with its large blue-green eyes for a moment, then says in slow, deliberate Jinu, "Zo et Tiluu Mununtra oh Yuuijuminlakiltra."

15:45:36 Tiluu Mununtra asks, "Uujuhi zu uu ku jolii won?"

15:45:36 [Enter `yes' or `no']

15:46:43 Tiluu Mununtra says, "Zon ul."

15:46:49 Tiluu Mununtra shows you one finger and says, "Uy."

15:46:51 Tiluu Mununtra shows you two fingers and says, "Uyo."

15:46:55 Tiluu Mununtra then recites slowly, "Ol, jak, sli, ki, gha, ju."

15:46:59 Tiluu Mununtra looks to you and shows you seven fingers.  It asks, "Listi et?"

15:47:00 [Enter your response to the Jinu, do not 'say' it, just type your answer]

15:47:57 Tiluu Mununtra says, "Ro."

15:47:57 Tiluu Mununtra looks to you and shows you four fingers.  It asks, "Listi et?"
[Enter your response to the Jinu, do not 'say' it, just type your answer]

15:48:25 Tiluu Mununtra says, "Re."

15:48:30 Tiluu Mununtra shows you three fingers.  "Ol."  It then shows you five fingers.  "Ske sli."  It then shows you all eight fingers.  "Et ju.  Ol ske sli et ju."

15:48:37 Tiluu Mununtra asks, "Jak ske uyo et?"

15:48:38 [Enter your response to the Jinu, do not 'say' it, just type your answer]

15:50:34 You power up the ship's engines, and the docking bay door begins to open slowly.

15:50:39 A launch trajectory is located.

15:50:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:50:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:50:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

15:50:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:51:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:51:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:08:44 The two-person light freighter "Sandbagger" is parked here.
You see a helpful sign, Ketchup the droid, Ron the droid, and Jenn the droid here.
You can go north.

17:08:47 Some lights on the two-person light freighter "Sandbagger" suddenly flash several times.

17:08:47 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Airlock]
You can go out and into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

17:08:49 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

17:08:52 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

17:08:54 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow.  Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

17:09:03 You punch a few commands into your personal credit assistant and receive the following display:

The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

17:09:06 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

17:09:14 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

17:09:14 You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

17:09:15 You power up the ship's engines, and the docking bay door begins to open slowly.

17:09:20 A launch trajectory is located.

17:09:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:09:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:09:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

17:09:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:09:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:09:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:12:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

17:12:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:27:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:35:13 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

17:35:13 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

17:36:25 There appear to be about 9 pilots recently active.

17:46:09 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

17:46:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey groans. "Hey... good morning folks."

17:46:39 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Morning or afternoon or evening or whatever it is."

17:46:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't even know."

17:47:15 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

17:47:16 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

17:47:25 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:47:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:47:27 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I had a couple of fruit flavored vodka drinks, and drank them a bit too fast last night. The trip home was a big blurry for sure."

17:47:49 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh, it happens."

17:48:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I remember we were celebrating clearing the vents... and um.. Then there were things that happened."

17:48:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Really hoping I didn't say anything too stupid."

17:49:14 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, everyone else probably doesn't remember much anyways."

17:49:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "One can hope, one can hope."

17:50:48 Not much to see out there.

18:05:04 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Hi."

18:07:31 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

18:15:41 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

18:16:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Mmm, oh Big Harry's Monkey Waffle House, what would I do without you on a morning like today."

18:16:50 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Have to get wings instead."

18:17:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They won't answer the phone for me anymore. I don't know why, I never did anything to them."

18:17:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe they don't serve rogue pilots."

18:17:50 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Maybe."

18:18:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or maybe they just don't serve AEU in general anymore."

18:19:33 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "I don't order much from either place anymore."

18:20:14 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I usually go to Colt's, I just don't have it in me this morning."

18:20:59 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I say that, though I did go over there and get my coffee from there."

18:21:03 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

18:23:01 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "I'm trying to give up coffee."

18:23:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Blasphemy."

18:24:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, nah. You're probably right though. The stuff's not really good for ya."

18:25:02 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Its not but I miss it."

18:25:15 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

18:25:47 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "I switched to tea, and its not to bad."

18:33:20 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "League."

18:35:50 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww! I bet that was Luja."

18:36:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She must hae just been way too excited to see her family."

18:36:24 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "I know she was looking forward to geting home."

18:36:42 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "I was sad to see her go!"

18:37:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I liked her. I never got a chance to really know her super well, but I would have liked to."

18:37:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Holy shit... this headline about the Union. this is terrible."

18:40:54 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "That sounds like its going to be a mess."

18:41:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. I hope it doesn't lead to all that violence again."

18:42:56 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Might make a housing issue when they are forced out."

18:43:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's people that have lived here a lon time that love the Union jus as much as those of us born here. It's just not right."

18:45:08 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Doesn't seem right, if they are working and not breaking laws, it would seem silly to make them leave!"

18:51:07 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'thirty minutes.'"

20:03:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:03:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:03:59 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:04:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:04:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:04:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:04:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

20:04:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:04:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:04:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:04:50 I don't understand that.

20:08:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

20:08:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:08:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:08:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:37:15 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Engineering Room]

20:37:16 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

20:37:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Let me see. I should."

20:37:35 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:37:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:37:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:37:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:37:40 [Starship "Raging Seas"; Airlock]

20:37:41 You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:37:47 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.

20:37:48 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:37:48 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:37:48 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:37:49 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:37:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:37:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:37:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:37:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:38:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:38:06 Which sector did you mean?

20:38:06 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

20:38:08 Invalid selection.

20:38:11 Your ship 'Raging Seas' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:38:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Calm. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:38:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:38:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Calm."

20:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Definitely check the book out then, Tara. I get decent conversion rates, but I'm sure I do a lot of stuff wrong."

20:38:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:38:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:38:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:38:20 The sensors tell you that this area of space is remarkably clear and free of hazards.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Residential Structure in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:38:23 Via general sector communication, Residential Structure transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Calm!"

20:38:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wow, some kid tried to break a suborbital pods doors?"

20:38:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I get about 98 percent."

20:38:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Apparently."

20:38:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:38:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never done better than 95%."

20:39:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How is the pay out for mining?"

20:39:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:39:19 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

20:39:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:39:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:39:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's pretty good. I think starting out you'll get about 50 million for 95% conversion."

20:39:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:39:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let me see, I've kept notes."

20:39:39 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:39:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It can pay out a lot. I get about 250 mill plus for my sites."

20:39:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores whistles.

20:40:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think Lily get's over 400 mill sometimes from her sites."

20:40:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, my notes don't go back that far. But I seem to remember about 50-60 for my earliest sites."

20:40:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:40:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:40:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

20:40:31 You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:40:31 You exit the ship.

21:44:57 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

21:45:00 Evenia an Eachtrannach kisses you.

21:45:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:45:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:45:08 You grin.

21:45:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:45:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:45:23 Evenia an Eachtrannach says to you, "Sorry I didn't come up and gun. I figured maybe. I should stay here."

21:45:25 Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

21:45:31 Tara Flores's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Im just waiting until I can get the colation mark 4 laser, and a few other upgrades before I try the fighter beacon.. though I might just try it in a stock fighter first. That way I won't lose my investment if things go wrong."

21:45:34 You laugh at Evenia an Eachtrannach.

21:45:38 You say, "Yeah, good idea."

21:45:41 The starship transitions into another sector.

21:45:44 Evenia an Eachtrannach absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

21:45:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:45:48 You say, "And it allowed me to switch rooms for grid."

21:45:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:45:57 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

21:45:57 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You could always rent a fighter, too."

21:46:04 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "This is true."

21:46:07 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That way you're not really on the hook if you lose it."

21:46:12 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "That's what I figured you'd do. And...you were 5% from that third fail, at one point."

21:46:15 Evenia an Eachtrannach grins.

21:46:18 You grin.

21:46:23 The starship transitions into another sector.

21:46:44 The starship transitions into another sector.

21:46:46 You say, "What's scary is having two heavies chase this thing with no failsafes left."

21:46:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:46:52 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "Did you get anything from the BAS on that last beacon? We didn't, I think he's going too far."

21:46:56 You say, "And only one gunner."

21:47:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:47:08 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Might want to staay closer to the BAS."

21:47:13 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Stay."

21:47:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:47:25 You say, "Yeah, I don't think we did eitherr."

21:47:26 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're just 3 down, this should be okay, right?"

21:47:30 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into the PA microphone, "You should stay within 2 sectors of the bas, otherwise, the BAS doesn't pick up the beacon."

21:47:31 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The last one was 4 up."

21:47:32 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "No, only two."

21:47:49 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yeah, what Eve said."

21:47:57 You wrap your arms around Evenia an Eachtrannach, pulling her close.

21:48:04 Evenia an Eachtrannach wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

21:48:08 Evenia an Eachtrannach nuzzles your neck softly.

21:48:10 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, shoot."

21:48:12 You smile at Evenia an Eachtrannach.

21:48:14 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, I launched already."

21:48:25 You say, "Well, then we'll do it here."

21:48:31 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into the PA microphone, "Remember for the next one."

21:48:33 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Well, we'll just do it here."

21:48:35 Evenia an Eachtrannach pulls up a tight indigo halterneck top with a v-neck and exposes her slightly larger than average firm breasts tipped with large dark brown nipples for a moment. Both nipples are pierced with a shiny gold ring.

21:48:44 You say, "Going to go gun."

21:48:47 Evenia an Eachtrannach absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

21:48:48 You kiss Evenia an Eachtrannach on the lips.

Help on: Sight-commands
-----------------------
In recent months, a large number of visually impaired players have joined Star Conquest, and in order to make the game more comfortable and accessible for them, we have added a few very helpful commands that many other players may also find extremely useful.

SIGHT (S I G H T): The SIGHT command has actually been a part of the game for a couple of years. Basically this command removes the 'visual' element from starmaps, screening out a lot of the gibberish that serves only to annoy and distract visually impaired players while their screen readers frantically recite dozens of dashes. It also does things like remove all but the ships you have keys to from the TRANSPORT menu in garages so that screen readers aren't scrambling to recite five million ship names. Most recently, this command also adjusts damage reports in starships to only list the damaged components, eliminating unnecessary extra spam. Overall, this is a very handy command.

BRIEF (B R I E F):  The BRIEF command makes it so that when you're walking around, room descriptions will not be displayed unless you specifically request to see it by using the LOOK command.

FOCUS (F O C U S): The FOCUS command is a combat command which allows you to focus on a single ship during combat instead of getting a huge list of ships to sort through. You'll be given a list of ships to choose from, and your weapons room will foc
22:59:55 us on that ship until you either use the FOCUS command again, or until the ship has been destroyed.

QUIET (Q U I E T): Finally, the QUIET command, though not specifically intended for blind players, is very helpful in cutting out starship spam. This command will only work in the starship you're currently in, and only in the control room. The starship will stay in quiet mode until you change it.

We hope these commands are helpful to our visually impaired players. We ask that our other players be understanding. If you come across a player who spells things very oddly, it's likely not their fault as they can't see the letters and can only hear how the words sound. Helping them in private with spelling can be very beneficial to everyone, as long as you do it nicely.

22:59:57 I don't understand that.

Help on: Sight-commands
-----------------------
In recent months, a large number of visually impaired players have joined Star Conquest, and in order to make the game more comfortable and accessible for them, we have added a few very helpful commands that many other players may also find extremely useful.

SIGHT (S I G H T): The SIGHT command has actually been a part of the game for a couple of years. Basically this command removes the 'visual' element from starmaps, screening out a lot of the gibberish that serves only to annoy and distract visually impaired players while their screen readers frantically recite dozens of dashes. It also does things like remove all but the ships you have keys to from the TRANSPORT menu in garages so that screen readers aren't scrambling to recite five million ship names. Most recently, this command also adjusts damage reports in starships to only list the damaged components, eliminating unnecessary extra spam. Overall, this is a very handy command.

BRIEF (B R I E F):  The BRIEF command makes it so that when you're walking around, room descriptions will not be displayed unless you specifically request to see it by using the LOOK command.

FOCUS (F O C U S): The FOCUS command is a combat command which allows you to focus on a single ship during combat instead of getting a huge list of ships to sort through. You'll be given a list of ships to choose from, and your weapons room will foc
23:06:02 us on that ship until you either use the FOCUS command again, or until the ship has been destroyed.

QUIET (Q U I E T): Finally, the QUIET command, though not specifically intended for blind players, is very helpful in cutting out starship spam. This command will only work in the starship you're currently in, and only in the control room. The starship will stay in quiet mode until you change it.

We hope these commands are helpful to our visually impaired players. We ask that our other players be understanding. If you come across a player who spells things very oddly, it's likely not their fault as they can't see the letters and can only hear how the words sound. Helping them in private with spelling can be very beneficial to everyone, as long as you do it nicely.

23:06:06 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Sure."

23:06:17 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Drone 1" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

23:06:21 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Drone 1" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

23:06:28 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Someone with an AEU 3?"

23:06:33 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

23:06:33 You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.
The floor trembles under your feet.
The computer announces, "This ship has been hit by target starship 'Drone 1.'"

23:06:38 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Or lower."

23:15:17 Help on: Units
--------------
     The storage unit, often referred to simply as 'unit,' is a mathematically-derived measurement of both mass and volume, which developed over many years in the steadily-growing aerospace industry.  Nowadays, it is ubiquitous in all forms of space transport, where both mass and volume are large factors.
     The nature of the unit is such that either a high mass or a high volume results in a high unit measurement.  Conversely, a low mass and a low volume make for a low unit measurement.

23:35:54 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

23:35:55 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
