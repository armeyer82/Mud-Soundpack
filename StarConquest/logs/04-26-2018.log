00:06 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

00:17 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

00:26 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

00:27 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

00:32 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

00:32 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.

00:33 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:33 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Break?"

00:40 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:40 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:40 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:40 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

00:51 You stand up from a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it.

00:51 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Mid]

00:51 You can go north, east, south, and west.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

00:51 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out.
Kiska the humanoid service robot clomps in after you.

00:51 You say, "Kiska follow."

00:51 Kiska the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order confirmed."

00:51 Kiska the humanoid service robot stops following you.

00:51 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Mid]

00:51 You can go north, east, south, and west.

00:51 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

00:51 You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, a sparkly ouija board, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.

You can go east, south, and west.

00:51 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:51 You wave.

00:52 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

00:52 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

00:52 Morris says to you, "Yo."

00:52 FCI Scout Lily Kaise (asleep)

00:52 She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light blue shipsuit with white trim around the collar and cuffs, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a clear camera with a sa
00:52 ucy strap, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

00:52 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, a sparkly ouija board, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.

02:10 You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, a sparkly ouija board, and a Tardick lizard named Zeus here.
FCI Scout Keegan Wantz is dozing on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. FCI Scout Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug. Constantine Stone is dozing. Ryan Thomas and Gonzales Bourne are standing here. FCI Scout Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow. FCI Scout Clarina Taylor and Kani Kahakai are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.

02:10 Kani Kahakai strokes a Tardick lizard named Zeus's warm scaly skin.

02:10 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:10 A Tardick lizard named Zeus settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

02:10 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Okay, you can start it back up. 2.3 LTC have been crossed."

02:11 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:11 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:11 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:11 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:11 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

02:11 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:11 A riftstorm appears to be 8.51 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic South and Very Slightly Up.

02:11 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

02:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels sits down on Kani Kahakai's lap.

02:12 You squeeze FCI Scout Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:12  You are wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

02:12 You are carrying nothing.

02:12 There appear to be about 25 pilots recently active.

02:12 The starship's computer and other communication links detect:

Additionally, there are 13 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 38 pilots.

02:14 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels kisses Kani Kahakai on the lips.

02:14 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says to Kani, "Did you have a nice rest?"

02:14 You wrap your arms around FCI Scout Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise leans on you.

02:15 Kani Kahakai exclaims, "I did!"

02:15 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:15 Kani Kahakai kisses FCI Scout Melinda Michaels on the lips.

02:15 Kani Kahakai says, "Seems like I missed scary patrol scaryness."

02:15 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

02:16 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:22 Constantine Stone navigates his plain touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

02:25 You scramble to your feet.

02:25 I can't find "pilow."

02:25 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels stands up from Kani Kahakai's lap.

02:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides east.

02:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides in from the east.

02:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels gives a serving of hot macaroni and cheese in a shallow bowl to Kani Kahakai.

02:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels sits down on Kani Kahakai's lap.

02:26 Constantine Stone switches a plain touch einrophone off.

02:26 You squeeze FCI Scout Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:27 Constantine Stone asks, "How can the Outsiders know what direction we were going in when they spot us? Are they just that good, or can we do that too?"

02:27 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Ping."

02:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Don't take but a couple seconds of watchin pings."

02:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "They sent pings like crazy."

02:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

02:27 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Every 20 seconds."

02:27 Constantine Stone asks, "I've never used a long-range scanner. What kind of information does it give you?"

02:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "They mathed it, surely."

02:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

02:28 Morris says to Constantine, "Ours give the size of the energy signature and what direction and distance it was last spotted."

02:28 Morris says to Constantine, "Not sure if theirs work the same way or similar."

02:28 Lily says to Constantine, "That is why we don't encourage pinging while in the rift."

02:28 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

02:28 You nod.

02:28 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "For one, it makes you super visible."

02:28 Lily says to Constantine, "As it will reveal the signature of your ship."

02:28 Constantine Stone says, "So you would need to get two pings off to establish the direction a ship is heading in."

02:29 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Probably. And since they ping bout three times a minute..."

02:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to FCI Scout Morris Corlew.

02:29 Constantine Stone says, "Luckily I'll likely never use a scanner."

02:29 Constantine Stone chuckles.

02:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Who knows what information they can derrive."

02:29 FCI Scout Morris Corlew looks at Constantine Stone thoughtfully.

02:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Derive."

02:29 Morris says to Lily, "Yeah...they're probably math geniuses and can math it out in 2.104 seconds."

02:29 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

02:29 You grin.

02:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Heh or have a handy something to figure it for them."

02:29 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Also...their computers might do it for 'em."

02:30 Constantine Stone asks, "I don't think I was awake, when we first got pinged. Were we not able to get to the control room and take the appropriate action within 20 seconds?"

02:30 FCI Scout Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

02:30 Constantine Stone says, "I suppose they might not need 20 seconds."

02:30 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "But also...I mean, even our computer tells us the direction they're goin when we spot 'em."

02:30 Lily says to Constantine, "I use a Long-Range fairly often actually."

02:30 Morris says to Lily, "He can't buy one with the skims closed. Farport won't sell 'em neither apparently."

02:30 Constantine says to Lily, "Yeah, but if you started when I did you wouldn't be able to."

02:30 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I know."

02:30 You nod.

02:31 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I think he was saying he wouldn't though and just trying to relate their usefulness. I have a couple of ships I can't upgrade for that reason."

02:31 A massive dark cloud appears, crackling with electricity, and the island is quickly swallowed by it!

02:31 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.
A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

02:31 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

02:31 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "Whooooosh!"

02:31 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I'm sure they're useful."

02:32 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Woo! Beautiful storm."

02:32 You grin at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:32 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:32 You say over the linked rift comm, "Hi Eve."

02:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "But like...the first notification we get says an Outsider patrol turns toward some direction and increases speed. So our computers tell us immediately. I imagine theirs can do the same."

02:32 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Holy rift speed Blackwing!"

02:32 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

02:32 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey."

02:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:33 Gonzales Bourne says, "When we are exploring just for fun we should increase speed and chase them. Let's see if they'll get intimidated."

02:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:33 The voice of FCI Scout Lily Kaise comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Pretty decent eh?"

02:33 Gonzales Bourne says, "Constantly pinging and all that."

02:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

02:34 FCI Scout Morris Corlew looks at Gonzales Bourne thoughtfully.

02:34 Morris says to Gonzales, "They won't."

02:34 You laugh.

02:34 The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "May be just a bit of an understatement."

02:34 Gonzales Bourne says, "Then they'll learn that they should."

02:34 Gonzales Bourne beams.

02:34 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "They'll pull you outta the rift and pop goes your ship. Billions upon billions lost."

02:34 You chuckle.

02:34 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gives FCI Scout Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

02:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

02:35 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "And considerin the lack of weaponry on a tac platform..."

02:35 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

02:35 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "My platform is now worth about 14 billion and it doesn't have everything quite as this one does."

02:35 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "They'll slice you open like a mater."

02:35 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, I missed the platform by about 2 weeks."

02:35 Constantine Stone says, "Though, even if I had been able to pick one up, I still would have no access to any upgrades."

02:35 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

02:36 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

02:36 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yeah."

02:36 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Kinda rough."

02:37 Constantine Stone says, "I think actually I don't really need any of the app ships."

02:37 Constantine Stone says, "But if I ever feel like I do, maybe I will."

02:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah, I haven't even tried for our combat ships."

02:38 You say, "I love my flare."

02:38 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Tac platform and long-range sightseers is my best option. Ain't been able to get one of the one-piece ships."

02:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

02:44 You chuckle.

02:44 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

02:44 Constantine Stone says, "Cause I scuttled the prototype."

02:44 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

02:44 Morris says to Constantine, "Can't say's I blame you though."

02:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Sure would love a Flare."

02:50 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And you guys will need to charge before we do."

02:51 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Eeeeh, maybe if it was a star or something."

02:51 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:51 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Pretty sure we've got debris in the hold and not all that far to go."

02:53 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "There is something to be said about being ready with charge when we are there, but we can still wait for something that burns better to refill."

02:55 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "It seems unlikely we will find place to recharge there, but who knows. Our ground campaign might also take a while, if it happens."

02:55 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

02:56 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not that this will help now, but you guys know about the prestellar out near 273?"

02:57 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:57 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I just tend to grab hydrogen offa comets in Orion. Takes much less time."

02:58 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'd rather do the whole travel, it means less salvaging."

02:58 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Lazy ass."

02:58 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:58 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Heh. I'd rather not spend four or five or more hours doin somethin I can do in 10 minutes."

02:59 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Though now I think about it, that was also the platform's first time in the rift. Otherwise I'm not sure I'd have bothered."

02:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "I didn't enjoy harvesting this stuff from comets but it didn't take longer than an hour."

02:59 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

03:00 Nissi Valdaire grins.

03:00 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "His trip out to that pre-stellar probably took at least five or six if he's talkin bout the time I know he went out there to do that."

03:01 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "My goal is to get Kani's industry up and she will become my furnace debris salvager."

03:06 Morris sticks out his lower lilp.

03:06 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

03:06 Morris sniffs several times and wipes nonexistent tears from his eyes.

03:07 Morris says to Kani, "She ain't even pinched my cheeks in months."

03:08 Melinda says to Kani, "Do it so he'll hush."

03:08 FCI Scout Morris Corlew glares.

03:08 Morris says to Melinda, "It's a pay per pinch service."

03:08 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:08 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

03:09 Morris holds out his hand to Kani. "Ten billion per pinch is the going rate. But...since I like ya...I'd settle for 10 million."

03:09 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Please."

03:09 Morris says to Melinda, "Yes?"

03:09 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "She's not crazy, yet."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

04:40 You gently caress FCI Scout Lily Kaise's back and waist.

04:40 Lily gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.

04:41 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

04:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:41 You say to Lily, "Well, I suppose I should say night. Rest wlel and sweet dreams. I love you."

04:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:41 Lily says to you, "All right Hun. Nite to you too and I hope you will rest well. Sweet dreams too."

04:42 You beam at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

04:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:42 You say to Lily, "Night."

04:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:42 You kiss FCI Scout Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:42 Lily says to you, "Nite."

04:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:42 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

04:43 Do you know what they want?

04:43 I don't understand that.

04:51 I don't understand that.

04:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:52 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

05:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:03 In the end, you can't really trust anyone but yourself, can you?

05:09 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest Well. I'll be up awhile."

05:09 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night."

05:14 There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that you are a failure.

05:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:14 Remember what I said.

05:15 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

05:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:44 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

05:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:55 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

05:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:05 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

06:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:15 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

06:15 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

06:15 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

06:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:36 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

06:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:47 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

06:57 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

07:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:07 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

07:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:15 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

07:16 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

07:16 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

07:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:38 With a jerk and a rumble, the ship slows down.

07:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

07:49 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

07:57 With a jerk and a rumble, the ship slows down.

08:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:07 A small vehicle pulls alongside, kicking up dust, before speeding ahead.

08:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:14 With a jerk and a rumble, the ship slows down.

08:20 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

08:20 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

08:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:30 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

08:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:46 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

08:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:57 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

09:03 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

09:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:13 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

09:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:20 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

09:21 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

09:22 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

09:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:40 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

09:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:51 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

09:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:02 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

10:05 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

10:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:10 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

10:11 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

10:22 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

10:23 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

10:23 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

10:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:38 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

10:39 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

10:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:53 A gentle breeze rustles through the grass, causing ripple-like waves.

10:56 There appear to be about 6 pilots recently active.

10:56 The starship's computer and other communication links detect:
%Morris Corlew  (L)
%Bilespawn Brunhilda Schreiber  (L)
%FCI Scout Evenia Callseah  (F)
%Gonzales Bourne  (F)
%Lorenah Mayfield  (F)
%Anfisa the Wanderer  (M) [v]

* == Out of communications range

% == Detected via Quantum Entanglement comm or Rift Link
Additionally, there are 14 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 20 pilots.

10:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:03 The wind stirs, launching a cloud of tiny spinning seeds into the air. They whirl off into the sky.

11:05 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

11:06 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

11:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:16 A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by peacefully.

11:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

11:23 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

11:24 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

11:36 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gonz."

11:36 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sup."

11:37 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

11:37 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The jib don't affect our headin at all. So feel free to see if you can get us more speed with it."

11:38 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

11:39 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

11:39 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wasn't totally sure. Nice to know."

11:40 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep. All it does is get us better speed if it's at the correct angle or less speed if it's at an incorrect angle. It won't impact our headin."

11:48 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

11:49 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

11:57 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

11:58 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

12:04 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well."

12:05 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thank you."

12:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning."

12:09 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

12:19 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

12:25 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

12:25 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

12:55 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

12:58 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

13:03 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

13:03 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

13:03 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

13:05 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

13:16 FCI Scout Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

13:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

13:34 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

13:39 You kiss FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

13:46 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

13:46 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Thank ya."

13:46 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Sharing is caring. We just wanna show you guys how much we miss you all. Well, all except ali."

13:46 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Is it possible to miss an AI?"

13:47 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Sure. I mean when you get used to it, I suppose you'd miss having it around."

13:47 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

13:47 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

13:47 The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hear that Ali, it's not because you're Artifitial."

13:49 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Did they make explosions?"

13:49 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

13:49 You say over the linked rift comm, "Well, biology is a science..."

13:50 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "They made explosions. Many many experiments were undertaken, different positioning of equipment was attempted. But finally, they managed to create, an Ali."

13:50 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

13:50 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Artificial is made by humans. My parents are humans. Instead of pushing a button, they pushed a... rod instead."

13:51 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.
You say over the linked rift comm, "Maybe they pushed buttons too."

13:51 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Wiggle wiggle."

13:52 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Do you think they overdrove it a bit?"

13:54 You wave to Ali Candan.

13:54 Ali Candan strides south.

13:55 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

13:55 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

13:55 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

13:55 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Y'all break?"

13:56 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "One person going out, I'm staying in."

13:56 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

13:56 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

13:56 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

13:56 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Copy. Just let us know when you're all set."

13:56 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

13:57 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Only...one person?"

13:57 Morris Corlew says, "There's only two over there."

14:04 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Plenty people?"

14:04 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Looks like Ted's reps outside are takin a bit. Thinkin of goin over but tryin to raise Eve to let her know I'd be comin. No luck."

14:04 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I got it."

14:04 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Ok."

14:04 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Johann said he'll head out when inside is done, but you're welcome to go lend a hand if you like."

14:08 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Ok."

14:08 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "They happen to say why they sent one person for externals and kept three inside?"

14:08 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "All set?"

14:08 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We are currently repaired."

14:08 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Other than being dumb asses?"

14:08 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Checking for full occupancy."

14:09 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Well...yeah..."

14:09 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

14:09 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes I know, I was outside to help because Ted was alone."

14:09 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "2 went out, 2 came back."

14:10 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes, looks good over here."

14:10 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah. We suddenly got 2 more."

14:11 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

14:11 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Mmmmph."

14:11 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

14:11 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

14:11 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We're good."

14:11 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

14:11 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, and I was still waking up when we broke down, so I missed the initial rush outside. I figured I'd work inside then if Ted needed help, I'd go help him."

14:12 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I figured that sort of thing would happen, and we weren't stopped for too long."

14:12 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Someone always wakes up when reps are ongoing. It's the way it works out."

14:12 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I still get nervous though because of the Joel thing."

14:13 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I wouldn't have left ya...Mel wouldn't have left ya."

14:13 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Exactly and it's why I don't like seeing several inside and one outside."

14:13 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, you are a more careful crew, it just still comes into my head."

14:13 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'd never have left you. I keep careful track of that stuff, so do these guys. That's why when you first went out, I gave them the situation."

14:13 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:13 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I bet."

14:14 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "For those who don't know, he was litterally almost left in a sector so the stupid idiot could go get his artifact in another sector."

14:14 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ted was almost left."

14:14 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:14 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yep. Then wanted to pick up the artifact before goin back for him."

14:14 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:14 You say over the linked rift comm, "That's happened to me before. That bites."

14:14 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I didn't know that bit."

14:14 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well like I told Ted, this is why we checck occupency before giving the OK."

14:14 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "When was Ted almost left?"

14:15 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Years ago."

14:15 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh, that time."

14:15 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:15 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yep."

14:15 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, after my scare of thinking I rifted out before Ali got back aboard, I make sure I'm the last one in if I can."

14:15 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "When I got done with Kringle, he laid in his bed and pouted for the better part of a day."

14:16 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "His lips would have been too sore to pout if it were me, teeth too."

14:16 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Think it must be 18 months ago now, god, that was a trip."

14:16 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:16 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yep. I do a count before we cycle, one before we cycle back, and check for debris when I hit the control room. No way am I gonna be the cause of somebody...I don't even wanna think bout that."

14:16 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Never beat on your crew on a trip if you can help it. Nobody has medical."

14:16 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Thank god they only vectored is all."

14:16 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "OH yeah, I count before we cycle, after we cycle, and check the rundown at least two or three times."

14:16 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:16 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I member hearin the stories of the almosts when I was a new pilot...then the thing with Joel..."

14:17 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well yeah, that's why I wouldn't do it if, I could help it. But..."

14:17 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "That was the trip Lillian was supposed to run and I had to. What a joke."

14:17 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:17 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ugg...yeah."

14:17 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yep, good job you were there Mel."

14:18 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah it could have been worse."

14:18 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:18 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yep."

14:19 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Then there was the time some brilliant pilot cycled from inside and nearly left Nissi outside after reps."

14:19 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "That's why I wait till I know everybody's in before I cycle."

14:19 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

14:19 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Um...they nearly did that to me on that trip you did last February mel...I was...kinda sluggish."

14:20 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

14:20 Constantine Stone waves.

14:20 Constantine Stone sits down.

14:20 Morris Corlew waves to Constantine Stone.

14:20 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at a tropical beach chair.

14:20 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, nobody admited to doing it when she came back in. I was still in the airlock waiting when they cycled and started yelling or who knows, they may have left."

14:20 Morris Corlew grins.

14:20 You wave to Constantine Stone.

14:20 Constantine Stone stands up.

14:20 Constantine Stone sits down on a tropical beach chair.

14:30 An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and advance into the fray.

14:30 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "Get 'em boys!"

14:41 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

14:48 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

14:51 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

14:52 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

14:52 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "We're in unknown space. Woo!"

14:53 Morris Corlew says, "Been for the better part of a day."

14:53 You nod.

14:53 Hawthorn says to Morris, "...way to rain on my excitement."

14:53 Morris says to Hawthorn, "Awww. Sorry."

14:54 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Jib no longer is useful. Deactivated."

14:54 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Ok."

14:54 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

14:56 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

15:00 Morris Corlew takes a sip from a can of peach iced tea.

15:01 Gonzales Bourne begins using a sparkly ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on R.

15:01 Gonzales Bourne says, "Rift."

15:01 Gonzales Bourne begins using a sparkly ouija board. The pointer rapidly moves across the board before coming to rest on U.

15:01 Gonzales Bourne says, "Ruft then."

15:01 Gonzales Bourne absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

15:01 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn laughs.

15:02 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

15:04 Morris Corlew stands up.

15:04 Morris Corlew drinks the last of a can of peach iced tea.

15:04 Morris Corlew gives an empty beverage can to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

15:04 Morris Corlew lopes east.

15:04 Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

15:04 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

15:04 Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

15:06 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

15:12 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

15:12 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

15:15 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

15:23 Gonzales Bourne switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

15:32 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

15:33 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

15:39 Morris Corlew stands up.

15:39 Morris Corlew says, "Be back."

15:39 Morris Corlew lopes south.

15:40 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

15:40 I see no "lily" here.

15:40 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

15:40 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, and a sparkly ouija board here.
Ryan Thomas and FCI Scout Clarina Taylor are dozing on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Constantine Stone is sitting on a tropical beach chair. FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn and Gonzales Bourne are standing here.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

15:50 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

15:56 Gonzales Bourne yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

15:59 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

16:00 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

16:00 I don't see that here.

16:00 I don't see that here.

16:00 "Well! You are traveling in style!" FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins at Constantine Stone.

16:00 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

16:00 I don't see that here.

16:00 You wave to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

16:00 You kiss FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

16:00 You wrap your arms around FCI Scout Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

16:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise kisses you.

16:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

16:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides east.

16:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

16:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:02 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

16:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

16:06 FCI Scout Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

16:10 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

16:13 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

16:13 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

16:14 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow..."

16:14 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Uh I think I'm gonna head for the ducts."

16:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:30 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

16:30 Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

16:31 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Hi."

16:31 Morris Corlew says, "Hey."

16:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

16:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Looks like we're already well on our way to another ten LTCs."

16:37 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

16:38 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:38 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

16:39 Morris Corlew says, "We're less'n 300 light-years away."

16:40 Morris Corlew says, "Oh sorry. Just over."

16:40 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn nods.

16:43 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

16:43 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

16:43 One of the group falls down into the snow. Others struggle past, too exhausted to help.

16:44 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

16:44 Ali Candan strides south.

16:44 Morris Corlew says, "Aww."

16:45 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

16:45 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

16:53 The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.

16:55 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "The fuck...this is new..."

16:55 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

16:55 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "What are we. Like...a backpack or something?"

16:55 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey, the washing machine looked pretty abandoned there. Do any of you ever... wash your clothes?"

16:55 Morris Corlew says, "Bein carried on somebody's back."

16:55 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh..."

16:55 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "I brought enough I ain't needed to yet."

16:56 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I put a washer and dryer in docking bay if it's still there."

16:57 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Washing machine? You tell me that's not a berthed Fringe starship?"

16:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:00 Ali Candan switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

17:01 Ali Candan switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

17:01 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south followed by Wendy Arroyo.

17:01 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

17:02 Nissi Valdaire takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:02 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

17:02 You wave to Wendy Arroyo.

17:02 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."

17:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Nissi Valdaire.

17:02 Wendy Arroyo takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:02 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Today is charging day. Who's excited?"

17:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Wendy Arroyo.

17:02 Wendy Arroyo says, "It's me, Freyja the Tardick lizard."

17:02 Morris Corlew waves.

17:02 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Me?"

17:02 Wendy Arroyo says, "I need to figure out an excuse to conveniently miss out on the shoveling."

17:03 Wendy Arroyo gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Someone will have to help Ian out while we're stopped."

17:03 Wendy Arroyo says, "With Nissi asleep, I guess it's up to meee."

17:04 Nissi Valdaire grins.

17:04 Wind whistles sharply over the icy plain as the group struggles closer to the city.

17:05 Wendy Arroyo strides east.

17:06 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Lily, your pizzas have achieved sentience and are trying to escape the galley."

17:06 Morris Corlew wrinkles his nose, looking faintly disgusted.

17:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Eat them all."

17:06 Wendy Arroyo strides in from the east.

17:06 Morris Corlew says, "Gross."

17:07 Wendy Arroyo takes a bite of a hot round piece of toast.

17:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well will certainly remove them so relax!"

17:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

17:07 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

17:07 Ali Candan strides south.

17:07 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

17:07 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

17:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "Elderly pizzas are an expedition tradition. I wouldn't know what to do without them."

17:08 Wendy Arroyo says, "At least, if a ship runs out of torpedoes..."

17:08 Wendy Arroyo sits down on a nylon relaxation hammock.

17:08 FCI Scout Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

17:08 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides east.

17:08 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "An expedition's hidden gem."

17:08 Wendy Arroyo says into the PA microphone, "I recommend a plasma flood."

17:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

17:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides south.

17:10 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

17:10 Ali Candan says, "Wow."

17:10 Ali Candan says, "Charging place too."
Wendy Arroyo says, "What a contrived coincidence."

17:11 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

17:11 A readout shows Pre-Stellar Object 5420-1565 about 8.72 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.

17:11 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well, looky there."

17:11 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Want me to pilot us in?"

17:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

17:11 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Okay."

17:11 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

17:11 Nissi Valdaire takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:12 Nissi Valdaire says, "This coffee needs to be at least half cream. And the other half sugar."

17:12 Wendy Arroyo says, "Well, guess it's up to me and to my expertise to ask Ian for the position. Dibs on not shoveling."

17:12 The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Moving for the object now to recharge and get more debris, probably."

17:12 Wendy Arroyo glances around at her surroundings.

17:12 Wendy Arroyo salutes sharply.

17:12 Wendy Arroyo scrambles to her feet.

17:12 Wendy Arroyo strides south.

17:12 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

17:12 With an exhausted groan, the traveler carrying the ship shrugs out of the straps and passes it to another.

17:12 The snow grows deeper and progress toward the city slows.

17:12 FCI Scout Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

17:12 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh, I didn't even see it show up."

17:13 You snuggle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:13 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

17:13 The icy wind abates slightly.

17:14 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

17:14 Ali Candan strides south.

17:14 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

17:14 Ali Candan strides east.

17:14 The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.

17:14 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

17:14 Morris Corlew frowns.

17:15 Ali Candan strides in from the east.

17:15 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

17:15 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Goooood damnit. Not this again."

17:15 Ali Candan cracks open a can of strawberry milk with a loud pop.

17:15 Ali Candan takes a bite of a hot beef burger with cheese.

17:15 Ali Candan takes the first sip from a can of strawberry milk.

17:17 Ali Candan takes a bite of a hot beef burger with cheese.

17:17 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

17:23 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

17:23 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hello."

17:23 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "How do you want us to set the furnace? WE being efficient, or fast?"

17:23 A small variation enters the rhythm.

17:23 The throbbing of the colors slows, as if drawing out the pleasure.

17:24 The tingling of your nerves intensifies.

17:25 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

17:25 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Always set it as fast as people can keep up with. Unless there's nothing to refuel with around."

17:25 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, we have two."

17:26 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "There are more than that on board who can shovel."

17:27 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ahh, they are waking up now."

17:27 Ali Candan asks, "We'll have to relink, right?"

17:27 Morris Corlew says, "If we move, yeah."

17:27 A small variation enters the rhythm.

17:27 The tingling of your nerves subsides slightly into warm pressure.

17:28 Ali Candan says, "Well, we'll salvage, so."

17:28 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

17:31 Ali says to Nissi, "Should we expel the stuff we have right now? Stellar should be far powerful."

17:32 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Did you guys get notified when that showed up on sensors?"

17:32 Ali Candan leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

17:32 The voice of Ali Candan comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yup."

17:33 Wendy Arroyo strides in from the south.

17:33 Wendy Arroyo takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

17:33 Wendy Arroyo pets Nissi Valdaire on the head.

17:33 A small variation enters the rhythm.
The tingling of your nerves intensifies.

17:33 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

17:33 A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startlingly like a single unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

17:34 Wendy Arroyo says, "Neat, off to do the thing."

17:34 Wendy Arroyo strides south.

17:34 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

17:57 
[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Shower]
This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

21:31 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

21:31 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

21:36 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

21:36 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

21:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

21:39 The computer announces, "Rift link formed with Zéro Des Cartes."

21:39 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Testing."

21:40 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.

21:40 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:40 You say over the linked rift comm, "We hear you."

21:40 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Please confirm you've got fourteen aboard over there."

21:40 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Think I got it."

21:40 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Confirmed."

21:40 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:41 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:41 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

21:41 The starship has left a unique area of space.

21:41 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

21:41 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks Ian."

21:41 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

21:41 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Yo."

21:41 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

21:41 Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

21:42 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "What's our estimated distance now?"

21:42 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz exclaims, "This is a new scape!"

21:42 You wave.

21:42 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "300 light-years."

21:42 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "A little over three hundred light-years. Or, if you're Ali, 301."

21:42 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Very good."

21:42 Morris Corlew says, "This is the one we were in comin into the pre-stellar."

21:42 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wait, this isn't the rift link."

21:42 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

21:43 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "She says so many weird things."

21:43 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn groans.

21:43 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey, I had a very elaborate, thought-out answer, but I sent it over PA instead of the link. I hope you somehow heard it."

21:43 Morris Corlew shrugs.

21:43 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn whistles.

21:43 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Nice speed."

21:43 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

21:44 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We did not."

21:44 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I choose to put the blame on you."

21:44 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I refuse to take it, haha."

21:44 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We're at an impasse."

21:44 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "TEDDY WARBLES."

21:45 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Calling you that was your punishment."

21:45 You're not playing this game.

21:45 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We are indeed."

21:45 I don't see that here.

21:45 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Find a hill and a sun, and we'll solve this the old way. Bring a second and your best stun gun."

21:46 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'll just pretend you didn't blame me in the first place."

21:46 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I missed you, Lexi."

21:47 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You can blame me for having no limericks."

21:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:00 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Give me all your peach tea."

22:01 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:01 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I coulda brought you some. I was right outside your ship."

22:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:11 "Maybe they'll have food, maybe there's something to hunt," a hopeful voice speculates, before being quickly shushed.

22:11 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

22:11 Morris Corlew says, "Um."

22:11 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

22:11 FCI Scout Lily Kaise blinks.

22:11 Quietly, Morris says, "Think they're...talkin bout us?"

22:11 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Whaaaaaht."

22:11 You ask, "Who was that?"

22:11 You glance around at your surroundings.

22:11 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

22:11 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "No idea!"

22:12 Shule shakes his head in confusion.

22:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:14 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I hope this race isn't starving. Now I wish I would have brought the other set of food bots as I would happily leave them for them."

22:14 Morris Corlew says, "I got a bunch if so. Easily replaced."

22:14 You say, "I hope they aren't starving e too."

22:14 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

22:14 Morris Corlew says, "I mean."

22:14 Morris Corlew says, "Not that they'll feed a planet."

22:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "I tossed out the pizzas even though I never minded pizza that is cold and a couple of days old but some people are really picky!"

22:16 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

22:16 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

22:16 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I actually like cold pizza."

22:16 Morris Corlew says, "Well I mean...it is 5 days old now."

22:16 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "4 but it's not any days old now."

22:16 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

22:16 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

22:17 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Anyway if it's something you don't like then leave it."

22:17 Morris Corlew says, "I don't touch your fridge for exactly that reason...less I need to put somethin else in there. Then...yeah, then I start wrinklin my nose."

22:17 Morris Corlew grins.

22:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "What fridge it's not there."

22:18 Morris Corlew says, "There was."

22:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well it's not now so you can relax now."

22:18 Morris says to Lily, "I never said nothin bout it."

22:18 Morris says to Lily, "You're the one brought it up."

22:18 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

22:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

22:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise winks at you.

22:19 You peer east...

22:19 
[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Galley]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see the galley vending machine, a stainless steel table, a stainless steel bench, a small black trash can, a tall vending machine shaped like a cat with a slowly swinging tail and glowing eyes, a sleek stainless steel beverage machine with purple accents, and a dark metallic red cold beverage machine here.
You can go west.

22:19 Morris says to Lily, "I ain't Wendy...by the way. I don't think we sound much alike."

22:20 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

22:20 Morris says to Melinda Michaels, "Yo."

22:20 Melinda Michaels nods.

22:20 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Melinda Michaels.

22:20 Morris says to Melinda, "You ok?"

22:20 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

22:20 Morris Corlew nods.

22:21 A baby wails, its cries muffled by a thick swaddling of blankets.

22:21 Morris Corlew frowns.

22:21 Melinda Michaels says, "Aww man."

22:21 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

22:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Aw."

22:21 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh...that's..."

22:21 Morris Corlew says, "Sounds hungry."

22:22 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Lots of travelers."

22:22 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

22:22 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

(
22:22 You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

22:22 Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

22:22 Gonzales Bourne suddenly awakens.

22:22 Morris Corlew gives Gonzales Bourne a thumbs up!

22:24 Gonzales Bourne switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

22:24 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

22:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:26 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

22:26 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

22:30 Morris Corlew says, "I got the oddest cravin for bacon jerky."

22:30 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:30 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles at you.

22:31 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Anybody over there got some bacon jerky?"

22:31 A baby wails, its cries muffled by a thick swaddling of blankets.

22:40 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, that sounds good."

22:40 Morris Corlew says, "Got an odd cravin for some."

22:40 Morris Corlew says, "Ain't had it in ages."

22:41 The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.

22:41 Morris Corlew frowns.

22:41 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

22:42 You say, "Ok, that was..."

22:42 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings.

22:42 You say, "That was disturbing in a very depressive kind of way."

22:42 Morris Corlew nods to you.

22:43 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Emote stares in abject horror and sadness."

22:43 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "I um have tis wandering pinky finger."

22:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

23:00 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "So we'll reach our destination tomorrow?"

23:00 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Looks like at least."

23:00 Morris Corlew says, "Lookin thataway."

23:04 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Might even be..."

23:04 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'd say afternoon, but I don't know when that is now."

23:04 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

23:04 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn glances down at his watch momentarily.

23:04 Melinda Michaels says, "Na, it'll be evening."

23:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Yeah?"

23:05 Melinda Michaels says, "Like this time or later."

23:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Even if we do this all night?"

23:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mmhmm."

23:05 You ask, "What are we doing all night?"

23:05 You chuckle.

23:05 Morris Corlew says, "Even we hit a couple really good storms, it probably won't be much sooner'n a full day."

23:05 Melinda Michaels says, "This speed."

23:06 You say, "Ah ok."

23:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ah."

23:06 Morris Corlew says, "We're goin 14 light-years an hour. Got a bit under 300 light-years."

23:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

23:09 Keegan Wantz nods.

23:09 Keegan Wantz says, "Zoom zoom."

23:11 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

23:12 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

23:16 You say, "Be back in a couple of hours."

23:16 You wave.

23:16 Morris Corlew waves.

23:16 You wrap your arms around FCI Scout Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

23:16 You stand up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

23:16 You can go north, east, south, and west.

23:16 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]

23:16 You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a personal hoverpallet, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.

23:21 You nod.

23:21 FCI Scout Lily Kaise pushes a button on a personal hoverpallet.

23:21 A personal hoverpallet beeps and begins following FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

23:21 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides out.

23:21 You don't feel very sleepy at the moment.

23:22 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

23:32 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

23:43 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

23:43 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.
