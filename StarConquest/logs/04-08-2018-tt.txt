Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling
bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a bag
of felo treats, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow
and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the
arachnoid security robot, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a hairy yellow
eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

several sheets of laminated technical specifications duct-taped to its surface.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Endymion Spaceport; Landing Pad.

Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method
against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go
after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is
going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track
of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target
retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement
information and send that information to your gunners.

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
The code that locates a rift accelerating station has been refactored to iterate
through all possible matching accelerators instead of stopping at the first one.
Or, in plain English: Rift accelerating should behave the same or better, but
please let us know if you notice anything odd.
   Posted 4 days, 13 hours, 4 minutes, and 26 seconds ago
-----
Flightlockers now have an EMPTY command, allowing the ship's owner to remove
anything from inside them.
   Posted 2 days, 18 hours, 41 minutes, and 31 seconds ago
-----
Ship titles are undergoing an overhaul that will eventually result in their
removal. Changes are now in effect for ship purchasing, sales, and destruction.
If you suddenly don't own a ship that you should, please let us know!
   Posted 1 day, 17 hours, 50 minutes, and 20 seconds ago
-----
The 'longest-range exploration ship' information in shipinfo is now hopefully
nominally more accurate, as it takes various in-flight recharging methods into
account.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation
order is entered."
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm!

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

A large cradle slides up from beneath and stops, displaying itself in the center
of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant
with silver spikes and reflective leaves.
This is a pair of intertwined stalks with very sharp silver spikes and thick
reflective leaves. The plant's primary color is silver with a sheen of deep
purple, faintly reflective, reminiscent of metal.
The plant has grown to fill its container.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

a ship called Sapphire Moon."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Depends on what you salvaged."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Are they big pieces? Or
little pieces. Like...You'll get paid more for comets than asteroids."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Asteroids mostly."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Yeah I need to find comits."
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "If you grapple an asteroid
drop iron and led. So you can stick more stuff in your cargo hold."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm down from orion. My
salvage mine!"
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Chuckle."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes chuckles.
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "I am south of it."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's fine, but you leave
my down sectors alone."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah giggles.
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Fine."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "I'll go down south where
it's humid and warm."
[General Communication] Evenia splutters out a laugh.
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes chuckles.
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "This debris sensor can't
sense but from like five units away so it's a bit difficult."

of orion, can you jump to 286 when done for ease?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks for that."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You are most welcome."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm even lazier'n that."

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "How can you be even more
lazy than that?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "Rift to Olivia's Pearl."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs. "Holy crap that's lazy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "See?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But lazy is good sometimes."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Taht is lazy jesus christ."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "That, too. I mean you can
just jump there."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hey, I admit it. It's faster
though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean, if I'm 5 sectors out
at some weird angle from Orion, why vector in if I can just do a short lil rift
hop?"
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Lazy, lazy!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes ma'am."
[General Communication] Petra Summers transmits, "Man I sure got a bunch of
roids. Now for the most boring stretch...salvaging."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But that's like...smart
lazy. You actually had to think about that for a second, to realize how
gloriously lazy it actually is."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "I know, it's horribly lazy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Tryin to remember when it was
I started doin that...what went through my head...and I can't think what it was.
Just remember seein other stuff on the long-range scanner super close and
figured I'd go for it."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Hehe."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Does it count as lazy if
like...I'm landed at earth and want to go to luna, I just...autovector rather
than jumping?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've had a rift drive on my
medium transport since back in the old days of 134 so I could turn around if the
flow was crappy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno. I do that too
though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Same with L5."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I mean. Why jump when you
can just..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Ya'll are weird."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks!"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Why thank you."
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "No probem."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Ok, who pissed off the

[General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "We've got peace keepers
firing at pirates here and an interdictor in here."

big enough wings so that it can fly. With stunning indigo feathers, and a
beautiful long-feathered tail. I have also put way too much thought into the
indigo feathered felo bird."

[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "That would be pretty."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I still am lookin for a white
either winged or feathered felo I can name Great Wing."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you'd said long-eared..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope. Don't think Great Wing
had long ears."
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "I'd name a gold winged or
feathered felo more than likely angel. But not seen gold feathered. Just red
feathered."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If a white feathered or
winged pops up. I'll tell you. I've got a couple white felo around. So who
knows."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Um...we might end up with one
on the org ship Ari. I just might have to move a couple gold over there."

There's Johann's avery, and I only recently had gold feathered on one of my

that gold armored over there."

or 2. And red and indigo long eared roaming round my transport. Kind of want to

that over there, lemme know. I won't mess with a project if you're usin it for
that."

project."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you have red long-eared,
they will take over your life."

[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Sorry bashed my head against
the wall since talking tonight was a mistake on my part."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Red has become like orange
felo. But red is more sly about it. You don't think it's taking over. Till
you're looking around. And all you see is a sea of red felo."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. I've never not had red
telepaths...that's what I started out with."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I started with gold, and now
guess what's creeping in?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[General Communication] Clarina Taylor transmits, "Red?"
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Rose is still my red pet
telepath. And still roaming around my apartment. At 3 months old. How. Long does
a felo live for? If it's a pet any way. The non pet ones seem to live for a
week. Or maybe 2."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anywhere from a couple months
to maybe 20."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Months that is."
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Holy. Fuck."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Very short, unfortunately."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The longest I had a pet live
was...My Kayo. I got her just after my first month as a pilot, so she lived like
16 months I think it was."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I miss my BoltSong. Never did
get him to fully trust me."
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "A felo living for 20 months?
That's not short that's like forever..."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's very short. Humans live
100 yearsish."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My ma's cat lived to be 26
years."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Then on the other end of
that, tiffy is looking gray around the mouth and I've had her...maybe three
months."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Even that's short."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. Eve, member that mean
hummer we worked on?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew coughs. "I mean."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew sighs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mean hummin felo?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The yella one?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He only lived 2 months."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And I gave him tonic right
outta the nest."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's...What the hell."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "I wish I knew what happened
to Erik. He was gonna give us some super long haired felo, and then he kind of
just never responded."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And Keegan's telepath,
scherzo...wasn't much longer. Even though that one came from the same nest as
Kumquat and Wobbles."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They were super cool too,
the mean humming felo."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/Name Changes.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I can check his ship Sara."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Wobbles passed away about a
month ago."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in General/Name Changes.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm sorry Aisling."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Aww. It was your first
wobbles that made me fall in love with the stumblers. I've had one in the pet
family ever since."
[General Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "He said he had a few gold
ones and a blue one, I think."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I can look later Sara."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Chuisle is still alive, but
is old now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Very long lived."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Awww. I remember Wobbles from
a few trips."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, if you want another
telepath, holler. I've almost always got kittens."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I like humming felo. Maybe
after Chuisle leaves me I will consider another."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And your beautiful silver
one Aisling? With the cool little feet? I suppose he's passed away too?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Oh my yes. A long time ago."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I still have photos of him.
I have photos of them all actually. He was a sweetheart."
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Silver felo exist?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Steven Timothy transmits, "I've got some silvers."
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Oh my god I think I'm in love.
I like silver."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They do. I can give you one
if you'd like one."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I would also take a blind
felo."
[General Communication] Clarina Taylor transmits, "I wanna silver feloooo!"
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Wonder if silver winged or
feathered exist."
[General Communication] Steven Timothy transmits, "We've got plenty!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I used to have more of 'em.
Had some telepaths. But the gold took over."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They do Ari."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Clari did Blake give you
guys the pet he got from me, for you?"
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Let's try again, anyone up
for megapod, nest, or have red want to go GMG?"
[General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Oh god. If I wasn't out at
134. Eve I'd love a silver if you can spare one. But I'll probably not make it
back until sometime later today."

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Retention: 50%
FRINGE NAVAL MASSIVELY PARALLEL TT ARRAY (endymion)
Requirements: 700 combat points
Maximum Targets: 3 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%
Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method
against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go
after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is
going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track
of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target
retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement
information and send that information to your gunners.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.
