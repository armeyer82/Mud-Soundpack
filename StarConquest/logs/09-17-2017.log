00:46:32 --
Johann,
Thanks so much for being so gracious as to allow us to come. You know i'm not into starting up heated disagreements with a bunch of other pilots around and in a confined space. In fact, I've called Morris down on his behavior as he and Aisling kept going at one another on one trip to the point where it just disrupted everything. Nobody could get a word in with others and it created horrible negativity. On this last trip, he and Sarah finally had their final falling out and oh my gods that was too much drama. This was destined to happen but it's always Morris and something to do with him.
As for Evenia, well it takes two you know. I didn't know what was even going on for two days until I went to check mail and as I was posting a letter, I suppose ather handed me a letter then I noticed it a little later as I wasn't looking up. I wrote yu both asking what was going on with the salvage Station, no response and then I was told by Constantine how she had removed modules from our warehouse without even a word. I can forgive and forget when people treat me and those who work with me fairly. People had told me that evenia can be your friend to the extent that it serves her. I honestly didn't believe them because there are so many really evil pilots out there and I felt they were merely spreading dirt and because they get away with it. I'd like to still hold Evenia in a higher regard than others do but what she did came across as betrayal when I thought out of all other pilots, that LIBS would stick with us and not give into Ather who, as you know is extremely bittered. I sympathize with ather's situation as what he did was not at all deserving of being rogued nor Eli. Still, i will do my utmost to get along with evenia on this trip but it will take me awhile to sort this out as I was deeply hurt by her actions.
As for your approach towards me when I might have been late with putting up a station, I will accept your word. I just felt put off because I already felt badly that I hadn't been able to put a station back together. Now that I have Constantine on board with building, he is a tremendous help and I know he was pleased to continue to help out with 777. Shule does also but he's just not much into building. He will go deploy stations but I have to do the assembly work ahead of time.
I'm sorry Johann for what I've said. I considered you to be a friend before but I felt that you turned your back on me for Ather's hate on Lily action. He found a means to exploit something and he got away with it for all of the wrong reasons.
As for the starship we'd like to bring, It may just be Shule and myself because Constantine is concerned about being away from his post too long. I respect his decision but he already has expressed a keen interest in Exploration and i so wanted him to be a part of this. I wanted our members to be able to launch and go artifacting if I wasn't available. But as long as i'm in the Sightseer, anyone can launch as it's a Long-Range. We have other smaller ships but they don't have Hyperwave and we can't go across the Skim to get upgrades so we couldn't get them upgraded. I haven't seen Tara around a lot over the past couple of days. I posted a Comm notice for everyone to be aware of and so hopefully, it will be that we can bring her along with us. So my answer is yes, a Sightseer and if Tara joins us, if there is room for her Scout or a Runabout for her, then fine. Otherwise, Shule and I will take her artifacting in the Sightseer as we don't want to prevent others from going who want to go as well.
As for maintaining 777, please reconsiderworking with us again. I know Nissi mentioned problems with stations but the only station I was involved with out in the other areas was the Asteroid station in 285 and it's been all Morris. Melinda wrote me a letter and explicitly told me that he wasn't to be added to the Asteroid processor so here I get caught in the middle because Morris is pressuring me and so my response to him was that if Joel didn't provide a module or we could figure out a Module that he could obtain, then I would certainly accomodate him but as per usual, this wasn't enough for Morris so I'm sure he put up a big fuss with Nissi and got his way. I really didn't care one way or the other but when he was pressuring me, I had to tell him
00:46:32  what i was asked to do and I still accomodated him. So this is no reason for us to be taken off of stations. If I had room for Morris, I'd accomodate him even though I am truly not over-fond of him. I consider this to be a business arrangement and liking someone isn't what always makes business evolve.
Johann, we'll be ready on the 22nd. If there's anything we can do, please don't hesitate to call on any of SEAS to help.

00:46:44 Lily. I don't have a problem with Seas coming along at all. I can't speak for everyone, but I hope that everyone going can at least be curteous while confined in a small area. Hopefully us all being in the same place will help everyone settle things down, although I do know that Evenia is still quite upset by some of your accusations, and an effort to positively communicate would go a long way towards mitigating that.

I appreciate your offer to provide stations, but we are actually already stocked up on stuff and the stuff we need is the stuff I need to get from cats. Since the only station that's providing money is the repair station, and probably only a few hundred thousand credits at most, no org will be missing out on much if any.

As a side note, I am sorry you took my tone about stations going down as me being upset. Generally when I ask about stations it's generally just me making sure people are aware it's down or almost down, and if they're not able to put it up what I need to do to help out. The only times I can picture being abrupt is if there's a pilot trapped somewhere, but that's more I want them to get home safely as soon as they can.

Also, clarification, if the four of you are going, you're bringing the scout? Or are you bringing the siteseer regardless?
thanks,
Johann Schraft

Subject: eath and Avarice is calling all pilots
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 22:56 16 September 2317 GST
--
Death and Avarice is calling all pilots is an Artifacting trip to a field of shipwrecks very far out there near Feng Wo Station in the Feng Wo Trading Collective. We may even get our hands on those rare remote Artifacts. I only have perhaps one of those rare Remote Artifacts out of the hundreds of artifacts that I have collected. So this is so exciting and it is an uncommon opportunity albeit since artifacts out over 30 Light-Trade Cycles don't even yield much for those of us with higher Exploration experience anymore.
Let's coordinate so that any of you who want to go are with Shule and me prior to leaving and so on.
Here are the Departure Details from Johann:
We will be departing on Friday, September 22, at 23:59. Please respond if you are going at least twelve hours before departure so we can organize who's going in the carrier and who is going with me in the transport.
The Carrier can accomodate 120 Units of docked starships. If a lot of scouts are docked, it means fewer people can go so take this into consideration. I am taking a Sightseer which only requires 5 Units of Docking Bay space whereas a Scout requires 12.5 Units. Our AEU Scouts are a bit smaller than League because of the League's larger Cargo Hold. Constantine or Tara, if you both w
01:06:41 ant to go and bring your own ships, remember that Hyperwave communications is essential out there particularly with situations whereby the Sector where the stations are becomes hot with Pirates, Ifs and let's hope no Outsiders. You certainly don't want to be on your way in if the Sector is hot and end up in an escape Pod. A Runabout requires 6.5 Docking Bay Units so that's not a bad choice provided you have a Autovector Drive as you won't needa Rift Drive either. Shule and I are fine to accomodate you both in the Sightseer. It will be a bit cozy in there with 4 of us but we will make it work! It's just that I have to be on board to launch it which I certainly can be most of the time. So it just depends on your own preference. If Johann can accomodate you, then bring whatever ship you prefer but nothing larger than an exploration Scout and you need to clear this with Johann Schraft prior to arrival to dock your starship.
This trip's duration is about three weeks of time as it will require a few days to travel out to this Field. I would think we will likely go to Andy's and perhaps onto tom Town and although it wasn't mentioned, perhaps to Feng Wo Station.
If you can join us, this is truly going to be one of those memorable trips and it will definitely be worth your time to participate.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

Johann, I will apologize to evenia but she isn't being as forthcoming as you'd like. I know for a fact, that she made advances toward Shule and it made Shule extremely uncomfortable as we are and have been an intact couple for over a year and a half now. We'd be married now if the aEU Government would allow AEU pilots to marry. It's like this Johann, we all meet others throughout our lives and careers who we are attracted to. It's how you approach thos attractions or how you choose to remain silent for personal or for professional reasons. You don't express such to another person who is in an intact relationship as it's an obvious ploy to cause interference. I knew this and thankfully, so far as i know, Shule has been faithful and I was willing to let this go since he is the one who sleeps with me. So based upon some other information i have which has certainly been expressed by other pilots, again, I was not in agreement with them as I thought perhaps Evenia was mis-understood, and yes, even knowing what I know relative to my own personal relationship with someone. So I didn't refer to her behavior specifically as being promiscuous but it certainly isn't appropriate behavior. Then when she didn't even inform me of her intentions and took the modules out of our warehouse, this sounded lots of alarms. It also created an atmosphere of a serious breech of trust. As for Morris, I didn't realize what he had done until Constantine informed me of Evenia's actions and so I took a look at the log and of course Morris was having a party out there obviously! I unfortunately will probably never trust Evenia to the extent that I did so she must agree to at least one condition before I apologize to her. That condition is that ifever she is to remove more than certain Modules from SEAS Warehouse, that we discuss it first. Yes those Modules belonged to LIBS. However, in turn, she tied our hands to the point whereby we have already lost the Transmitter in 777 which I was going to put together that day as I certainly wanted LIBS to be included in spite of not making a single credit on anything but the Toll Station Still, I am willing to apologize to her but she must agree to be more forthcoming about things in the future. I would not allow anyone from SEAS nor do that to LIBS without your having some knowledge about what was to take place and the reasons why. I really don't think this is too much to ask as it's merely asking for common courtessy towards the party to whom you may no longer to do business with. They should at least have an understanding as to the circumstances of the breech of contract or other business arrangements. If a Trustee of mine did this, I would demote them. I don't dictate to my members but I hold them to a high ethical standard and so far, I believe in all of them. If I could divide up SEAS into shares, each would have equal ownership because I look to them as having their own Organization which I was able to provide startup costs and other aspects for but it's theirs as much as it is mine. So this is another reason why I take this personally as although others wanted to inflict harm upon me, they didn't stop to consider that there are three others besides me. Therefore, if they have an issue with me, then they should address it with me and not SEAS. I am personally disappointed that I couldn't participate in the protest as I would have but personal circumstances kept me away for which I don't believe I owe an apology for except that I regret that I couldn't be available. This sort of harsh treatment was not warranted as I have done far more than the majority of AEU pilots to oppose Outccort and I won't stop for as long as I am able to. Our Liaison office is so not responding to us too which gives me the impression that we have made progress. I'll probably put up some more signs before I escape out of Comms too and if they catch me, then good luck to them! So yes, Evenia isn't perfect, nor are all of us but she needs to communicate her intentions especially when they are as drastic as what occurred the other day. If I receive your acknowledgement of this, I will restore yours and Evenia's access to SEAS Warehouse. I never revoked Nicolette's because, ironically, she has been one of the few pilots who have been reasonable and fair when we worked together o
03:21:18 n the Asteroid station in 288 and otherwise. we've also had our differences. However, I've seen a lot of very positive growth in Nicolette and so you see, I am always willing to forgive others when they make an honest and concerted effort to correct their behavior. I am sorry that Nicolette's own organization didn't go forward. However, I find some humor in what she was doing and perhaps this is what her intention was all along! As oftentimes, I would love to express something very similar and especially to the Morris's in the Universe! Take Care, Lily

03:21:46 You say, "Ok, thanks for letting me know."

03:22:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well she did try to make advances awhile back righ?"

03:22:35 You say, "Yeah, she did."

03:22:49 You say, "At ummm, the salvage op."

03:23:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah so I don't htink my memory is that short. So Love I so admire your being faithful."

03:23:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

03:23:12 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:23:15 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:23:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

03:23:50 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:23:53 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:23:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:24:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident points at a letter.

03:24:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That one is from johann."

03:24:30 You say, "She flashed me and I always wished you could have been there to flash."

03:24:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow."

03:24:37 --

03:24:38 Lily. I don't have a problem with Seas coming along at all. I can't speak for everyone, but I hope that everyone going can at least be curteous while confined in a small area. Hopefully us all being in the same place will help everyone settle things down, although I do know that Evenia is still quite upset by some of your accusations, and an effort to positively communicate would go a long way towards mitigating that.

I appreciate your offer to provide stations, but we are actually already stocked up on stuff and the stuff we need is the stuff I need to get from cats. Since the only station that's providing money is the repair station, and probably only a few hundred thousand credits at most, no org will be missing out on much if any.

As a side note, I am sorry you took my tone about stations going down as me being upset. Generally when I ask about stations it's generally just me making sure people are aware it's down or almost down, and if they're not able to put it up what I need to do to help out. The only times I can picture being abrupt is if there's a pilot trapped somewhere, but that's more I want them to get home safely as soon as they can.

Also, clarification, if the four of you are going, you're bringing the scout? Or are you bringing the siteseer regardless?
thanks,
Johann Schraft

03:24:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Where was this?"

03:25:26 You say, "When we were doing all of those salvage ops out at 277 or whereever it was at."

03:25:38 You say, "Of course, there were a lot of other people around."

03:25:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Wow that wasn't that long ago just wow you mean out of comms?"

03:25:54 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:26:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "And she still was trying to advance on you?"

03:26:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident frowns.

03:26:28 You say, "Well, I don't know because there were others around."

03:26:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well take that evenia you will never have my man."

03:30:54 You say, "And yeah, it was 274."

03:31:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah ifever I do that it's definitely teas ing but this sure does make me think."

03:31:25 You say, "I know."

03:32:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just as I said there, we are human to be attracted to others. It's what we do with our thoughts."

03:32:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's how we choose to behave."

03:34:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well Love if it's a party or something like ifever we go back to NQ, I really won't care. It's a high-spirited thing there and people may do things they wouldn't feel comfortable with elsewhere and/or just do it in the spirit of the moment and just have fun and be a little mor liberated. Now if you don't go home with me nor me you, then, we've got problems!"

03:34:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

03:38:29 You exclaim, "Heck, if we ever do go back to attend an NQ party and you feel like stripping completely, go for it!"

03:38:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:39:01 You laugh.

03:39:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I haven't done that since I was barely out of being a Cadet and I'll admit I had the hots for pierre and he for me but when I found out he was with Cheri, I was so humiliated."

03:39:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I wouldn't do that on purpose to another woman."

03:39:41 You say, "Awww."

03:40:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So yes Pierre always had something special but I told him in no uncertain terms and I really grew to adore Cheri. I don't think she considers me the same anymore but I will always care about her."

03:42:08 You say, "But it seems to me that Pierre and Cheri have a bit of a more open relationship..."

03:42:21 You say, "AT least from Pierre's point of view."

03:42:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I really hope he is with Cheri now. She didn't work a lot so I can understand somewhat but if you were in a similar situation, I would wait until the end of the Universe for you. I'll always be here for you."

03:43:17 You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

13:16:07 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

20:49:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What Melinda said earlier on her board post should be considered by those of you who are considering going. You're basically still working in a sense, but not contributing it until the "strike" is over, which doesn't really fit in with the definition of a strike. It's like filling a bunch of transports with debris and tritium and waiting to turn them in until the strike is over. It doesn't count cause you're still putting in the work."

20:51:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You definitely have a point, Ather. I was hoping having billions of credits they knew they couldn't get at until the strike ended might entice them to play ball."

20:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "However, that only really makes sense if we're all committed to never working again if we don't get what we want."

20:53:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I know that I am. The rest of you, I know that you're trying to shoot high, and you're pretty fresh out of pilot training. I understand that your priorities are different. The administration is probably counting on that though, and waiting for you guys to just say fuck it and start working. Which we can't stop you from doing, but I'm doing what I can by cautioning you."

20:53:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ather is correct up to a point Constantine but you should do what you want to.

20:55:18 I don't understand that.

20:55:22 You open a small suitcase.

20:55:26 You need a free hand to take that.

20:55:29  You are wearing nothing. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a backpack, and a metallic gold touch einrophone. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left uncovered.

20:55:29 You are carrying a sheet of white paper in your right hand, and a small suitcase in your left hand.

20:55:34 a sheet of white paper

20:55:34 This thin sheet of slightly nubby white paper is of standard stationery size.
This is a letter. It is not addressed. You recognise the handwriting as belonging to Lily Kaise.

20:55:37 --
Johann, I will apologize to evenia but she isn't being as forthcoming as you'd like. I know for a fact, that she made advances toward Shule and it made Shule extremely uncomfortable as we are and have been an intact couple for over a year and a half now. We'd be married now if the aEU Government would allow AEU pilots to marry. It's like this Johann, we all meet others throughout our lives and careers who we are attracted to. It's how you approach thos attractions or how you choose to remain silent for personal or for professional reasons. You don't express such to another person who is in an intact relationship as it's an obvious ploy to cause interference. I knew this and thankfully, so far as i know, Shule has been faithful and I was willing to let this go since he is the one who sleeps with me. So based upon some other information i have which has certainly been expressed by other pilots, again, I was not in agreement with them as I thought perhaps Evenia was mis-understood, and yes, even knowing what I know relative to my own personal relationship with someone. So I didn't refer to her behavior specifically as being promiscuous but it certainly isn't appropriate behavior. Then when she didn't even inform me of her intentions and took the modules out of our warehouse, this sounded lots of alarms. It also created an atmosphere of a serious breech of trust. As for Morris, I didn't realize what he had done until Constantine informed me of Evenia's actions and so I took a look at the log and of course Morris was having a party out there obviously! I unfortunately will probably never trust Evenia to the extent that I did so she must agree to at least one condition before I apologize to her. That condition is that ifever she is to remove more than certain Modules from SEAS Warehouse, that we discuss it first. Yes those Modules belonged to LIBS. However, in turn, she tied our hands to the point whereby we have already lost the Transmitter in 777 which I was going to put together that day as I certainly wanted LIBS to be included in spite of not making a single credit on anything but the Toll Station Still, I am willing to apologize to her but she must agree to be more forthcoming about things in the future. I would not allow anyone from SEAS nor do that to LIBS without your having some knowledge about what was to take place and the reasons why. I really don't think this is too much to ask as it's merely asking for common courtessy towards the party to whom you may no longer to do business with. They should at least have an understanding as to the circumstances of the breech of contract or other business arrangements. If a Trustee of mine did this, I would demote them. I don't dictate to my members but I hold them to a high ethical standard and so far, I believe in all of them. If I could divide up SEAS into shares, each would have equal ownership because I look to them as having their own Organization which I was able to provide startup costs and other aspects for but it's theirs as much as it is mine. So this is another reason why I take this personally as although others wanted to inflict harm upon me, they didn't stop to consider that there are three others besides me. Therefore, if they have an issue with me, then they should address it with me and not SEAS. I am personally disappointed that I couldn't participate in the protest as I would have but personal circumstances kept me away for which I don't believe I owe an apology for except that I regret that I couldn't be available. This sort of harsh treatment was not warranted as I have done far more than the majority of AEU pilots to oppose Outccort and I won't stop for as long as I am able to. Our Liaison office is so not responding to us too which gives me the impression that we have made progress. I'll probably put up some more signs before I escape out of Comms too and if they catch me, then good luck to them! So yes, Evenia isn't perfect, nor are all of us but she needs to communicate her intentions especially when they are as drastic as what occurred the other day. If I receive your acknowledgement of this, I will restore yours and Evenia's access to SEAS Warehouse. I never revoked Nicolette's because, ironically, she has been one of the few pilots who have been reasonable and fair when we worked together o
20:55:37 n the Asteroid station in 288 and otherwise. we've also had our differences. However, I've seen a lot of very positive growth in Nicolette and so you see, I am always willing to forgive others when they make an honest and concerted effort to correct their behavior. I am sorry that Nicolette's own organization didn't go forward. However, I find some humor in what she was doing and perhaps this is what her intention was all along! As oftentimes, I would love to express something very similar and especially to the Morris's in the Universe! Take Care, Lily

21:18:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If anyone asks you out there how many artifacts you have, you don't have to answer."

21:32:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I had all of those soldiers and they just vanished so those were viable and then I had mostly sabre-tooth in the starline for all these three or so years then I accidentally got rid of the last of the speckled I had so unless any come out of these dark-tipped which inter-bred, no more speckled and those were pretty good with sabre-tooth so we'll see how it goes and I may likely end up with just one shp too."
