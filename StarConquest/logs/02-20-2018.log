-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:24 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a pair of tan suede clogs here.
You can go out.

For Beacon drops. The BAS will be located just West of Steel Phoenix Command. Thanks to Starseekers help with these along with SEAS. Tomorrow a more advanced Xenology Scanner which utilizes the Quantum Xenology Scanner will be deployed East of Steel Phoenix Command. To access these stations, simply Jump to Steel phoenix Command and move to the eastern edge of the sector. Then, enter the next Sector East for the Salvage Processor and the Xenology Scanner. To access the BAS, simply move to the Western edge of the steel phoenix Command Sector and to the next Sector West. Please utilize these stations as we may not continue to sponsor them if in a month or two we determine that no AEU pilots are utilizing these Stations. [18:01 19 February 2318 GST]

Subject: NOUVEAU QUEBEC GREATEST FAT MARDI OF 2318
Author: Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys
Posted: 23:52 19 February 2318 GST
--
Allo to all pilotes and other people able to read this!

It is once again time for glorious Mardi Gras of the Fat Mardi at Nouveau Quebec! Some might say it is rather soon after Newest Year super party, but it is important to maintain dominance as bestest party station of space.

Now, glorious celebration will start on the Saturday of the 24th febuary at 2369, or 2359 if you subscribe to inferior units of time.

You want to come? Very exciting! Perhaps you could take space bus at Foxtrot Station around The Arm? It has fair chance of arriving on time and it even has toilet now. You could always use own ship, or go with somenone else. There might even be accelerators around the area to get there faster.

Either way, just bring your boobies and credits: we shall supply the beads. It is a BYOB, if you will.

Not interested in sexiness of party? Why, I had secret dispatch from the Ministre Des Cartes Stellaires that a starchart might or might not be available for the buying!  It might or might not be limited time offer, so be sure to take pause from mining and gathering mold to visit.

Call me if you new more of the information, I am in the directory.

03:44 You ask, "Did he ever get a patriot-class ship?"

03:44 Lily Kaise says, "Also because he destroyed his Patriot rather than merely giving it back to them as I had urged him to do."

03:45 You nod.

03:45 A medium-sized shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

03:48 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battle-Scanning Solar Temporary Station at Exploration Waypoint 69820 is now on emergency power.

03:48 Lily Kaise says, "Oh there we go."

03:48 Lily Kaise says, "In an hour, we can deploy the other one."

03:53 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

03:55 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:55 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:55 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:56 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:56 You say to Lily, "I love you and only you."

03:56 Lily Kaise beams at you.

03:56 Lily says to you, "I love you and only you too."

03:57 You beam at Lily Kaise.

03:58 I don't understand that.

03:58 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

03:58 Lily Kaise whispers, "I know Love. So do I."

03:59 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

04:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:00 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:01 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:02 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

04:02 Lily Kaise whispers, "Sure if you want to but I thik you kow how far to go with that or now right?"

04:03 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:04 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

04:04 Lily Kaise whispers, "As I say you ought to know where to go with that."

04:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:05 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

04:05 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:05 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:06 You say to Lily, "But no, I'm not going to totally make out with you and have sex with you in front of everyone."

04:06 Lily Kaise exclaims, "That's right you're not!"

04:06 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:06 You chuckle.

04:07 Lily Kaise says, "Um that's not how people are typically there anyway."

04:07 You say to Lily, "But I'll definitely leave your panties on if that's what you prefer."

04:07 You say, "I know."

04:07 Lily Kaise says, "Flashing is about as far as most people go in the first place."

04:08 You say, "Well, the year I went, there were topless people there and such."

04:08 Lily Kaise says, "Yes but that's not toatallly naked."

04:08 Lily Kaise says, "It does happen with some but not everybody."

04:09 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I'll only take off what you're comfortable with."

04:09 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:09 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:09 Lily Kaise says, "I just tend to leave when athat starts to occur as I just don't see the point."

04:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

04:11 You grin at Lily Kaise. "Then again, you've been totally naked there before."

04:11 You chuckle.

04:11 Lily Kaise says, "Only one year and that was after being in the acadamy for two years and just bored out of my mind! Since then I haven't."

04:11 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise. "I know."

04:12 Lily Kaise says, "I personally am not interested in doing so as I day I don'tlike the company we will be around for the most part."

04:12 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I understand."

04:13 Lily Kaise says, "Around you, yes. If we do go and can get a room at the Inn, then we can do what we want Love."

04:13 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:13 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:13 Lily Kaise says, "I will try to get the starchart but doubt I can."

04:14 You say, "Yeah, most of the League and Fringe pilots I wouldn't even touch if I were single."

04:14 You say to Lily, "That'd be cool if you could."

04:14 Lily Kaise says, "Heh there''s not one of any from those alliance that I would go near."

04:15 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

04:15 You say, "YEah."

04:15 You say, "And not many from our alliance that I'd touch either if I were single."

04:23 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

04:26 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:27 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

04:31 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:34 Lily says to you, "Ok let's go deploy the new BAS."

04:34 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:34 Lily Kaise holds your hand, taking you into her group.

04:34 Lily Kaise pulls you to your feet.

04:34 Lily Kaise grins.

04:34 You follow Lily Kaise out.

04:35 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:35 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:35 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starfish, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:35 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:35 [Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]

04:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, and a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go up and out.

04:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:35 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:35 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:35 Lily Kaise stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

04:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:35 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:35 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:35 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

04:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:36 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Starfish! Welcome to home space!"

04:36 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:36 You stand up.

04:36 Lily Kaise pulls you towards her.

04:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:36 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:36 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:36 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 984" has launched from New Earth.

04:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:36 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starfish. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:36 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:36 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:36 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

18:15 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a pair of tan suede clogs here.
You can go out.
