-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

14:45 [Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, and a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.
You can go up and out.

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good afternoon."

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Kim."

18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "While I personally don't mind the government's choice to reject an invitation to give one of our pilots temporarily to the EAOS, if the rest of you think differently, let me know, and I can send a message to the liaison office on your behalf to see what they'd say about picking one of you for the post."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Though the EAOS does have final say on the candidate regardless if it is how it was last time."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I frankly am disheartened that we're not represented. That's just my own humble opinion."

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "When was the last time people were temporarily inducted into the EAOS and what was the reason for inviting people then?"

18:38 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Money Maker". The organization has earned 1,875,541.64 credits.

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And yes, I am too disappointed that 1, we are not represented, and 2 that our government apparently deamed it unimportant for one of us to be represented, and even unimportant to ask us what we think about that."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Precisely."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It was several years ago, and the primary purpose was to test out things like the rift drive, more than anything else to be honest. They sent us to scout out places like the Radio Bubble and the Glyphmakers Grave before making the technology available to other pilots and then making the locations known to the other pilots as well. Odds are that they probably will have something similar for the new detachment to test."

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I personally would love such a challenge. They would likely not choose me but it would be a great opportunity for one of us."

18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, we are already getting very much isolated, if this continues and our government keeps this up, soon the AEU will count for nothing. Certanly not the AEU pilot corps. I don't think we should just accept that."

18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The person who's chosen will have to work well with the other alliances, for sure. Since you'll be working with members of each at any given time. The person who's chosen will also have to be reasonably active, I'd wager."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I personally have never had any problem working with anyone, with the rare exception here and there."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But you're also not very active, generally."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well when it involves work, one must be professional and put their personal differences aside."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not saying I definitely want to do this. But we are totally passed by and that does annoy me."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "1 Yes, it's though our government doesn't regard any of us as being able to contribute or to have any talent."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll forward your concerns to the liaison office, and leave it to them to pass to the government, who will make their final decision about whether or not they choose to agree to send a pilot that the EAOS will then select."

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alright, I have sent a message."

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Of course, Shule and Constantine and any other active pilot have not had a say about this either."

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well the message has been conveyed so."

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, the worst thing that can happen is that they just say no, right?"

18:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right."

18:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which they probably will, in all honesty."

18:50 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is now online!

18:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise whistles.

18:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Scoop scoop away!"

18:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I just brought a new Starseekers scoop online, while I was not doing anything else majorly important. I think I will do something industrial next."

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "After all, Starseekers is really only uh, like 800 points away from a better salvage processor."

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Speaking of modules, I put some more in Seas's warehouse."

18:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes, I noticed that and thanks. I think keeping the Salvage, BAS and Asteroid stations is worthwhile. We don't have sufficient activity to totally make me happy but in time, we'll be able to encourage our pilots to use these stations. Also I'm not too concerned about the expense at this time since we earn more than enough form our scoop to cover those and then some."

18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Same here, and I have plenty of credits to convert to megacredits, so there isn't any real problem there."

18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also though, anytime either of you want the Xenology station to go back up, just say."

18:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is probably a good idea we wait until we either run some sort of artifacting trip, or until several new pilots are actually out there artifacting."

18:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Exactly, that's my thought too."

18:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or if we can get across to GM G and make a group effort to do so."

18:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well, if plenty of us have been to GMG and we want to cash the artifacts from there, that would be worth it too."

19:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I suppose I need to go haul some roids this week, because so far we've only made 5 mil from there, this term?"

19:00 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We need one person who has several hours that will want to go on these turtle missions. Probably kind of low GCP people need not apply."

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can run you all across to the glyphmakers for a prolonged period of time if that is desired. However, with the Fringe willing to work with us, which many of them have shown they are, why not ask to go with one of them, or even some of the League pilots who are still willing to work with us? That won't only show that you all want to go out and do things again, but it will show that you all are willing to go out and do things with people other than members of the AEU."

19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup. I don't earn anything from artifacts from GMG anymore but I'd love to go back out and it would be a good opportunity. I'd imagine we'd put a recharge station up out there and stay a few days to make it wort while."

19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, how can you take us to GMG when none of us can go? Just curious? And I do agree, working with pilots from other alliances should stay important."

19:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Actually we are willing to work with others but have already been shunned form other activities when I volunteered overc tactactal."

19:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "First of all you're incorrect. We can go to glyphmakers if we want to. We can't use the skims, there is a difference."

19:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, so you know the way there without the skims, right."

19:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It was League who did that so I wasnt shocked heh."

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think yesterday Johann took Constantine on beacons, but not sure that means he's always willing to take us, or whether he really was just very desperate to get a cruiser beacon going."

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yewh well I belive Johann would be the exception."

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Johann works with us all the time. He's helped me cleanse old frontier before."

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "As well as Katina."

19:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Cool!"

19:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hello AEU."

19:06 There appear to be about 27 pilots recently active.

19:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Shule!"

19:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Shule!"

19:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have no issue with working with Fringe either but Evenia said they hate the aEU so there you go."

19:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Evenia has worked with me on several occasions as well."

19:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "As have several fringe pilots."

19:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Glad she will."

19:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, Evenia hates the AEU? I wonder whether that only applies to her, and how can they sign up to be a part of the Steel Phoenix and hate the AEU, that makes no sense."

19:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Same here some are pretty brainwashed by League though and those are the ones who likely won't."

19:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There is a divide in the Fringe. I believe Elaine, their current voice is not working with us, but a vast majority of the Fringe pilots are more than willing to work with us, and have done so repeatedly in the last couple weeks."

19:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey guys."

19:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi constantine."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Constantine."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, damn. This headline about the EAOS."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Constantine."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess we at least have John Gray in there."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though I see him around pretty rarely."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh I'm not sure."

19:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Gray does not really count."

19:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that's what I thought."

19:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh you think he won't be part of whatever they're planning?"

19:11 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings quietly as it receives a new notice.

19:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Unlikely."

19:11 You glance at your communicator's screen.

19:11 There are pending large credit transfers that require processing. You can view them at your civilian liaison terminal.

19:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it sucks that we aren't represented. The Best administration hates the EAOS though, so I guess it isn't surprising."

19:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ather! Stop spending all your money!"

19:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

19:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It was very well spent."

19:11 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I now have a total of 55 signal amplifiers."

19:12 The damage control systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Wow, any reason you need so many?"

19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well i'm in the middle of a debris field so Shule can."

19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, because I'm always crafting things for folks and making back that money."

19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "In triples!"

19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, right."

19:12 You scramble to your feet.

19:12 [Starship "Starfish"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:12 You exit the ship.

19:12 [The Torus; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

19:12 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

19:12 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:12 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:12 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

19:12 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

19:12 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:13 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

19:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "One sensing array will get me like half of that money back."

19:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:13 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:13 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

19:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:13 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:13 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

19:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

19:13 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

19:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah I ahve a good cache of GMG parts but i've been holding out until we have a means to get across the skim. But I can supply any Engineering or other tools for a very long time."

19:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:14 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

19:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

19:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:14 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:14 You scramble to your feet.

19:14 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:14 You exit the ship.

19:14 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and Archie the autonomous robotic canine companion here.
Ather Jammoa is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

19:14 You can't go that way.

19:14 Go where?

19:14 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

19:14 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I've been going to glyphmakers on a fairly regular basis because I've had people to go with, but parts have become rarer to find there."

19:14 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

19:14 You can go north, east, south, and west.

19:14 The door is kept closed by a keypad lock.

19:14 You can't go that way.

19:14 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

19:14 You can go north, east, south, and west.

19:14 You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.

19:14 You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

19:14 You can't go that way.

19:14 I don't understand that.

19:14 You close the door.

19:14 I don't understand that.

19:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Signal amplifiers and webbings in particular."

19:14 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:14 You face the Space Defense Captain terminal.

19:14 The screen displays the following options:

[Enter `yes' or `no']

19:15 You have approved this transfer.

19:15 End of pending credit transfer queue.

19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow interesting. I have a good supply of both but I'll hold out for awhile as i'm not in need of cash so."

19:15 You remove the 20:00 03/03 AEU space defense report from a brushed steel desk.

19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If any of you would like to clear old frontier by the way, since there are four of us available, we could do this!"

19:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sure. I'd be up for it."

19:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, there rae considerably more than four. We could definitely do this."

19:24 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:24 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sorry the grapple was noisy over here what's the plan?"

19:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "To clear old frontier."

19:24 The ship is already in that sector.

19:24 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alas, the interest is way too minimal."

19:27 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Sorry, Ather, what was that all, frontier, turtle suits?"

19:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, we could do either or. Heck, we could do both of all of you have a few hours."

19:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How involved is this turtle suit mission, and yeah I am up for frontier."

19:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Shouldn't take more than three hours total to do both thrall suits and frontier."

19:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Coming back to New Earth."

19:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, you talk to the officer in steel Phoenix. They tell you that they're going to send a decoy signal to lure a battleship a few sectors west of steel phoenix. We go there, and help the Steel Phoenix patrol destroy the weapons on the ship, then we board it and illiminate the crew so that we can destroy the control board and bring down the shield. That takes about an hour, hour and a half total."

19:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I will need a few to get over there as will need to go pickup my suit and htings."

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have a couple of hours perhaps 2 and a half but unfortunately not more than that but could do another part later if needed."

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What suit you want me in for old frontier?"

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, if people don't have enough time, let's economize. Kim, do you want your battlesuit?"

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Let's do old frontier first, keeping our station relatively bari free is more important than my turtle suit. And we can then see what we can do."

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK."

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Shule, do you have an EAOS tier 5?"

19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Do you want me in my EAOS 3 again?"

19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No, just tier 4."

19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Actually I'd like you in AEU, Kim."

19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "OK Shule, bring that. Lily, you have a RATS tier 5?"

19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

19:34 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

19:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

19:46 Lily Kaise says, "I had my rats out I don't mind playing with it."

19:46 Lily Kaise asks, "So you sure?"

19:47 Ather Jammoa says, "There are potentilaly tenuous situations in the vents that don't relaly give the time to try to figure out a suit's functions. I'd rather you work on fmailiarizing yourself with it somewhere like tesla or glyphmakers."

19:47 Lily Kaise says, "Ok will go switch."

[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat.

And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go east and south.
