00:34:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

02:08:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

02:35:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:35:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Wow... lots of debris in The Vortex."

02:36:02 You say, "Yeah, I thought it might be something about that."

02:38:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Keepan eye out for pirates out there though."

02:38:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Should I call out over tactical or this channel?"

02:39:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Try here first, if no one responds, then say something over tactical."

02:39:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Flint". The organization has earned 999,315.49 credits.

02:39:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Noted."

02:39:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or just press the distress button."

02:39:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Oh, so that's what that big red button labeled "Panic" is for."

02:40:09 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:40:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, last time I checked it was labeled distress, but yeah. It will send a distress all over channel 4."

02:41:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:41:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And will automatically tell us where you are."

02:41:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

02:41:37 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand.

02:41:42 You stroke the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

02:41:43 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs softly.

02:41:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Ah, that's useful indeed."

02:41:46 You pet Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the head.

02:41:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:42:00 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:43:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:43:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And be careful about using distress as it's like that old fairytale where crying wolf too often is..."

02:43:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Noted."

02:43:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "If you cry wolf, you summon wolves?"

02:44:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:44:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:45:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

02:46:40 You say, "I think I've only used the destress button twice ever."

02:46:56 You say, "Distress, that is."

02:47:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I never have but one time when I was horribly chained and lost a ship, I should have but I was too ashamed hehe."

02:48:20 You say, "Awww, it happens. The one time I remember, I was salvaging, saw a ship jump in, didn't know what ship it was until it came to me and fired on me. Then I realized it was a pirate ship."

02:48:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:48:45 You laugh.

02:49:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:49:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

02:50:09 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:50:17 You grin.

02:52:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:52:42 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:52:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:52:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

02:52:49 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:52:51 You scramble to your feet.

02:52:51 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:52:53 You exit the ship.

02:52:53 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

02:52:55 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:52:56 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:52:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:52:56 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:52:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:52:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:52:59 I don't understand that.

02:53:02 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:53:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:53:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:53:16 The starship is already moving.

02:53:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:53:47 You begin the docking sequence.

04:42:25 Minor Change:

04:42:25 
A few ground combat changes:

- Spinward suits no longer get gravitics. This made them somewhat too powerful and took away from the Fringe suit's unique flavour.
- Spinward suits now get blades instead, which are more comparable in damage to projectiles and rely on swift strikes. Rules of nature!

04:42:52 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

04:42:52 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

04:43:02 You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

04:43:11 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

04:43:21 The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" touches down smoothly on the ground.

04:43:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There's a little over 5 hours remaining on the current Asteroid Processor. I am not sure what Constantine is up to so we could jsut go ahead and take it out and deploy the replacement? I know I won't be awake in 5 hours."

04:43:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:43:34 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:43:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

04:43:35 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:43:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

04:43:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:43:43 You say, "I can be."

04:43:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

04:43:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

04:43:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok then."

04:43:52 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:43:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:44:00 You laugh.

04:44:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "You snuk in!"

04:44:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident giggles at you.

04:44:09 You laugh.

04:44:14 You say, "I'll get it deployed."

04:44:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok it's ready to deploy, just deploy the last station."

04:44:29 You nod.

04:44:31 You say, "Will do."

04:44:33 You grin.

04:44:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:44:42 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:45:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or if you happen to see Constantine and he wants to, fine. We just should keep this one going."

04:45:05 You nod.

04:45:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "It's a popular one!"

04:45:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

04:45:17 You ask, "It's the one out at 285, right?"

04:45:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup."

04:45:25 You say, "Cool."

04:45:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The only asteroid processor up for the time-being."

04:45:49 You say, "That's what I thought."

04:46:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I kind of think Nicolette sort of put the other one on the back burner as it wasn't getting much use."

04:46:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:46:25 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:46:32 You nod.

04:46:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:46:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:46:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:46:48 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Psi-2! Welcome to home space!"

04:46:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses some buttons on the communication board.

04:46:55 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Greetings."

04:46:56 Via general sector communication, AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Psi-2 directs a standard signal at this ship: "Greetings."
Via general sector communication, AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Omega-2 directs a standard signal at this ship: "Greetings."

04:46:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:47:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:47:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:47:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:47:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:47:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:47:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:47:09 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:47:09 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:47:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:47:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:47:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I so admire those guys."

04:47:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:47:15 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:47:18 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:47:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Except for that exercise the other day."

04:47:28 You say, "So, I found out something interesting. Of the 528 ships registered to the AEU civilian fleet, there are only two flares in existance."

04:47:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:47:30 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:47:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:47:40 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:47:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:47:57 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:48:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:48:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:48:11 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:48:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:48:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:48:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

04:48:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:48:17 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:48:33 You say, "So, I found out something interesting. Of the 528 ships registered to the AEU civilian fleet, there are only two flares in existence."

04:48:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So what were the losses during that skirmish yesterday."

04:48:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Oh?"

04:48:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Wow that's a lot!"

04:48:58 You say, "Yeah."

04:49:06 You say, "And only two flares."

04:49:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup yours and Athers."

04:49:15 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

04:49:22 You say, "Three navy ships."

04:49:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I knew Ather had the other one."

04:49:34 You nod.

04:49:45 You say, "I'm just surprised no one else has one."

04:49:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm not."

04:50:41 You say, "But yeah, we lost three navy ships last night."

04:50:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I never applied for one. I think Eli was probably interested moreso in Long-Range sightseers for the time-being and I am not sure Kim would bother so."

04:51:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Aww tht's sad."

04:51:07 You nod.

04:51:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm so glad we went in."

04:51:27 You say, "Me too."

04:51:42 You say, "That small navy against those six bing-class gunboats."

04:51:52 You say, "They responded with only three ships."

04:52:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There are other AEU pilots who would certainly be eligible but they're not active."

04:52:15 You nod.

04:52:32 You say, "And Ather owns the only pincer in the fleet."

04:52:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup."

04:52:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Annie had one."

04:52:47 You nod.

04:53:21 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chirps quietly as it receives a new notice.

04:53:27 You glance at your communicator's screen.

04:53:27 You have one mail message.

04:53:32 You say, "I have ail."

04:53:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:53:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:53:36 You say, "Er, mail."

04:53:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:53:41 You say, "Not ail."

04:53:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:53:45 You chuckle.

04:53:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:53:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:53:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We'll go get it."

04:53:54 You say, "Ok."

04:53:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:53:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:53:59 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

05:50:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Good. My head was working right, then. I thought maybe I screwed up and set it to 7 million."

05:50:24 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "5 billion toll prices."

05:50:27 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'd be having words if it had been!"

05:50:38 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Dakhal is insane."

05:51:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We know this."

05:51:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ather, is this a good time for you?"

05:51:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hey Ather."

05:51:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And if it had been set wrong...It would have taken like 2 seconds to fix it."

05:52:08 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Compaq". The organization has earned 165,660.46 credits.

05:52:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "After I spent hours getting back from the bubble of course."

05:54:02 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Bad flow there too?"

05:54:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not. I was hoping to see you earlier in the day."

05:55:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How much would it cost me to buy an artifact detector from someone?"

05:56:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ah. It's going to be difficult to come across me early during the day until Friday."

05:56:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "On my way out here, the flow would have been right in my face if I were going home. So it would take a couple hours."

05:56:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I paid a reasonable friend price to Eve for mine, Tara. I think she would be happy to help if you asked."

05:56:51 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If only I could just like, stuff a capsule in my bag. Problems solved."

05:57:55 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm sure there are miniature models of said capsule that you can stuff in your bag."

05:58:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That would be sorta cool actually. A little capsule moddle."

05:58:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah coughs. "Model."

06:00:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And in the mean time, if you feel like artifacting, we could go in my scout. I don't know if I want to pick up any myself yet, at least until I talk to Eli and Ather."

06:00:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'd be happy to fly you around while you grab some."

06:00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nah, its all good. I have a scout of my own now."

06:00:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm hoping to just gather up artifacts for now."

06:00:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I know, but it might be less lonely to go with somebody else."

06:01:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And mine is a lot faster, and has a detector."

06:01:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just an offer, if you ever want to let me know."

06:02:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And that goes for anybody of course, Dak and Okinaj."

06:04:57 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, the rift flow changed!"

06:37:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't suppose anybody remember what day our last meeting with Lambeth was on?"

06:40:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Whee, ifs Warship in Orion's belt."

06:40:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be there shortly."

06:40:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "I get to play keep away, pretty banged up."

06:41:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Got two peacekeepers in sector."

06:41:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

06:42:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They can shoot you from very far away, if you weren't aware."

06:42:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So leave the sector if you can."

06:42:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, they split."

06:42:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Cowards!"

06:42:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Indeed."

06:42:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Thanks for the response."

06:43:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No prob, thanks for calling it out."

06:46:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Bad luck on artifacts."

06:46:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How far have you gone?"

06:46:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nine sectors so far. Long way to go."

06:47:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin chuckles.

06:47:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

06:47:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "When I went out to 777 I went hundreds of sectors and came home with 8."

06:47:21 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Compaq". The organization has earned 102,500.69 credits.

06:47:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You have to kind of get a feel for how many you typically find in a trip."

06:47:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "When I was starting out it made sense to quit after 8-10."

06:47:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Now I can pull about 30 from a search of 1000 sectors."

06:48:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course, that can take a very long time."

06:48:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So keep those engines upgraded!"

06:49:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hard to get those engine upgrades without doing beacons, and I expect beacons will be rare soon."

06:49:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What makes you say that?"

06:49:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, at least beacons done by our own alliance."

06:50:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You may be right, but I wouldn't count us out just yet. There are only about 4 people actively striking, and I know Shule will still do beacons."

06:51:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Really only Ather has said he won't do beacons."

06:51:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I will be striking for this conquest. I'm just gathering artifacts for my own fun. Not turning them in."

06:52:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Also Tara, if it lifts your spirits, I usually average an artifact every 30-50 sectors."

06:52:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Depending on how long I've been searching."

06:52:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So don't let it get you down if you go a while without seeing any."

06:52:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They'll turn up."

06:54:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Once I found 30 searching only 770. I think that was my best day ever, but I'd have to examine all my old notes."

06:54:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Earlier today someone turned in a hundred artifacts at once from the bubble. Apparently they made a billion credits."

06:55:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that sounds about right. I turned in 62 a while back and got over 700,000,000."

06:57:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident lies back in a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

07:00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll be happy when I have better engines."

07:00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll get 'em."

07:02:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Pretty tempted to have vulcans on the next combat ship I purchase."

07:02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How come?"

07:02:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I like vulcans."

07:02:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, well, you gotta go with what you like."

07:03:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Depending on the ship though, you might be leaving some damage potential behind. A lot of our ships make better use of lasers than most."

07:03:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Aye, I'll be sure to watch for that."

07:03:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Could put them on your fighter, I mean I don't think the fighters that even cadets can get have systems that improve the effectiveness of lasers, do they?"

07:03:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nope."

07:04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Careful, I might take that suggestion."

07:04:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Are any of the fighters unique to the AEU? Can anyone purchase the Hyperion fighters?"

07:05:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think that chains do make some sense on a fighter due to its smaller grid, but I like lasers since I favor torpedoes on them. Minicannons are a bit grid hungry for fighters, and I don't like having both weapons rely on ammo."

07:06:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Chains might make a lot of sense on the 6-turret fighters, since those are really light on grid, but I've never experimented with that."

07:06:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I'd be happier to use those fighters if they had a warp drive."

07:07:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "First artifact!"

07:07:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed, I keep a bastille for when I go artifacting and to try harder beacons, but I still like my cadet fighter."

07:07:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

07:09:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I imagine that heavy fighter is pretty great with vulcans loaded up on it."

07:09:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It even has a pretty great cargo hold, it's like it had that in mind."

07:11:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the hold's good for its two launchers as well."

07:11:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Someone said I could find books in the liaison offices? Where at exactly?"

07:11:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They're in the voice's office."

07:11:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "To my knowledge there's only one book in the box currently."

07:11:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But you're welcome to a copy."

07:11:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Ah, ok. Guess I'll go hunting for a ship guide."

07:12:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The voice's office is the first door on the left."

07:12:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, you should be able to to grab those at the bookstore in the spaceport."

07:12:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The box only has Morris's industry book."

07:12:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is also a great read."

07:15:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Number two."

07:16:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone cheers.

07:30:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Some sort of weird bubble thing. I think I found one of these on the expedition."

07:35:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

07:36:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The first artifact I ever found was a Jinu plasma bubble."

07:37:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wait, that's plasma?! how come we can safely touch it?"

07:38:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That I don't know. It must be contained within some field, I'd imagine."

07:38:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I considered keeping my first find, but it looked slightly degraded, and I was worried it might be dangerous to carry around New Earth."

07:39:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "My first find was a Fringe torpedo. I had the distinct feeling that I didn't want to keep it."

07:39:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

07:39:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Artifacts like that just stress to me how much we need to make contact with the Jinu again.."

07:39:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."

07:42:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Some.. sort of sensor device? it looks old."

07:44:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Lot of old alliance tech out in that field."

07:45:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "This thing must be pre-subjugation."

07:46:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah. What is 777, the resting place of the New Earth 40th? Or 44th?"

07:46:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "40th."

07:46:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think that fleet was wrecked in a pre-subjugation battle."

07:47:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Must have been a massive fleet."

07:47:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It was. I went and visited the graveyard of the Telexan 134th some time ago, too."

07:47:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We've lost a lot of ships."

07:48:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh! I think the ship I was on in the expedition passed the 134th on the way home."

07:48:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

07:54:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "To float in this sector and sleep, or to turn back. Hm."

07:55:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I have slept out in uncharted space many times. I don't know that I can really recommend it, as it is inherently risky."

07:55:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But you might be okay."

07:55:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli!"

07:57:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Guys the headlines, I really do think we need to go full strike on this."

07:57:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I had been waiting to talk to you about it."

07:57:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But that's all I need to hear."

07:57:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm all in, obviously."

07:57:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I only didn't strike last conquest beucase I had already done stuff and I prefer to finish what I start, Eli."

07:59:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I reviewed the voice terminal notes and the status of accord missions were not really clear to me from them."

07:59:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wrote to someone at the accord for clarification, just out of curiosity."

07:59:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But as I told Ather, I don't need to salvage to eat, so it really doesn't matter to me."

07:59:48 [General Communication] "Who owns Li'l Chubby?" Evenia Callseah chuckles.

07:59:59 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um."

08:00:22 [General Communication] Prichard Grant transmits, "It's a very modest ship."

08:00:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "A cargo hauler, named Li'l Chubby. That makes me giggle."

08:00:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Are you nearby constantine?"

08:00:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm in my office."

08:00:43 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's an awesome name!"

08:01:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also, a belated welcoem back Tara."

08:01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks!"

08:02:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Would you mind coming to the bridge?"

08:02:05 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "I saw that and first and had to scan."

08:02:23 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "At first."

08:02:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not at all."

08:03:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have traveled 1109 sectors today on my grand artifacting mission, and I am not done."

08:19:19 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

08:23:18 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker.

08:27:19 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

08:29:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Tara, you said your joining in the strike? You know the plan is to go all in now. The only thing we'll still be doing is responding to threats to humanity."

08:29:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah."

08:29:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Fantastic, that is beautiful."

08:30:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Like I said earlier, I prefer to finish what I start and pulling out half way when I've already worked enough didn't seem right, for last conquest."

08:30:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right on, I just wanted to make sure you knew it wasn't just an inudstry strike anymore."

08:31:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er an industry strike anymore."

09:04:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli, where does that flight control scanner come from? Just ship supply stores?"

09:04:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "FTL communications, I believe."

09:05:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Super handy."

09:05:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that sounds useful."

09:05:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Especially when there's like a spreader jumping around and such."

09:05:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

09:11:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Could you hear that, constantine?"

09:11:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I read you."

09:12:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

09:14:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good old omnidirectional capsule caster."

09:14:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How were you doing that?"

09:15:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just in general or making it omnidirectional."

09:15:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "In general."

09:16:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh it's the Hypercaster upgrade, it should be in the book if you have a copy."

09:16:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

09:17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pretty sure it's a Farport upgrade. You can send messages very far. It normally has to be given a headig like the rift drive, but the capsule only has a shorter ranged one that casts in every direction."

09:17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting."

09:20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Got that one."

09:22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Gotta be careful though. Ships that you don't intend to pick up your cast can still pick them up and use the to hone in on your location."

09:23:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

09:23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How do you trace a ping?"

09:24:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well you can't really trace it exactly, but I'm sure you noticed that it gave a general direction of where it came from."

09:24:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, so they could just start heading that way until they found you."

09:25:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pretty much, yeah."

09:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Any other time and it would be busy busy busy."

09:28:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm amazed."

09:28:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Have you seen any more activity?"

09:28:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not a peep."

09:29:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, weird."

09:29:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've only got it tuned to the allinace right now, I'm sure they're jumping around in other places."

09:29:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The alliance."

09:30:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits an irritating burst of static.

09:36:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm going to watch for 20 more minutes then hit the hay."

09:36:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But when I wake up I'll have nothing buy time on my hands."

09:36:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I'll get right back to it."

09:36:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah sounds good. Try to get others to join you when you do."

09:36:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Will do."

09:37:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sanity. I couldn't have got better flow coming home from the bubble. Well I could, but not by much."

09:37:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's the journey. Not the destination. That matters."

09:38:12 [General Communication] "I'm guessing you mean the flow of food-based nouns?" Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

09:38:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah giggles. "No, nutball. The rift."

09:39:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A nutball is probably a food somewhere."

09:39:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No no. A nutball. Is you."

09:40:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's like they smelled us coming."

09:40:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess this is just not the busy part of the day."

09:41:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I suppose not."

09:43:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You cool with me using that line?"

09:43:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Absolutely."

09:44:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I like it. It really says a lot in very few words."

09:44:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah!"

09:45:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So should we think about setting up message beacons in the three hub sectors?"

09:46:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or will the message potentially not fire quickly enough to catch a ship in the middle of a jump sequence."

09:47:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think they fire unless they detect that the ship is not jumping again."

09:48:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

09:48:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's not going to be there long enough, I don't think they work, let me test that real quick though."

09:50:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Now that's interesting, the forecast actually went off before I jumped out, so that might actually work."

09:51:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It might be worth a shot. I'm sure they will be taken down, but it will certainly make the news."

09:51:50 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 20,421,093.75 credits from a xenology submission.

09:52:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What would we need, message tops, cores, and precharged batteries?"

09:52:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "All the artifacts."

09:52:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "All of them!"

09:52:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wouldn't presume to use SEAS's resources, but if I'm allowed to buy those parts I'd be happy to."

09:52:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I don't think Lily would begrudge me the use of her constructor to do it."

09:53:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah,  I don't think she would I'm sure Invaders can help too."

09:54:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."

09:54:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I am a trustee."

09:54:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I might be comfortable."

09:55:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But if they don't require megacredits I'd be happy to use my own funds."

09:55:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, I'll see what that would cost."

09:55:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And maybe set them up."

09:58:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, 20 million EAOS would buy the cheapest setup."

09:58:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think anything else would be needed, as I bet they'd need to be replaced daily."

09:58:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll buy and deploy the first round."

09:58:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you think this is a good idea, that is."

09:59:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Let me come over and buy a part or two, so that it shows you weren't alone."

09:59:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh okay, I appreciate that."

09:59:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm trying to find out right now if the message beacons will still go off."

10:00:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. That would be good to know."

10:00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I suppose we can test it too."

10:00:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

10:02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And as soon as I left,  league transport to Aenea."

10:02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Gah!"

10:10:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ugh."

10:10:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Dak."

10:11:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ou alright Dakhal?"

10:12:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Yeah. Want some advice? Landing pads make terrible places to sleep."

10:12:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

10:12:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not sure where the thrid one should go? Riverway I guess?"

10:13:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I think so. I don't think traders make their way to the frontier cluster ever, do they?"

10:14:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "So I noticed that the Gemini doesn't list much of anything on the starmap, but plenty on rundown."

10:14:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "What's up with that?"

10:14:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What kinds of things is it not listing?"

10:14:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, so for the message."

10:14:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking this:."

10:14:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Registered merchants, please turn back. Trading goods in Union ports actively endangers human lives. Profit for Best is Power to the Outsiders."

10:14:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Things like debris and stations."

10:15:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that too much?"

10:15:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or not enough?"

10:16:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I'm not sure what could be the cause of that. I have to confess I've never actually flown my gem, only hauled it in my carrier."

10:16:23 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon at Providence Gate is now online!

10:18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm yeah that sounds good. I'm not sure why exactly but using the word actively maybe a bit much? But hoenstly at this point it probably doesn't matter."

10:18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I can take that out."

10:19:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, the beacon definitely fires."

10:19:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's something."

10:19:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I feel like we're doing something, which is good."

10:20:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Can you cange the message on a beacon after ti's set?"

10:20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hopefully this message strikes a chord with someone."

10:20:14 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

10:20:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you are on it, yes."

10:20:46 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Can anyone change it?"

10:20:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "As in. If your org. Or yourself is on the beacon. It can be changed by you. If not. Well..."

10:21:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If they are part of an org that is on it, yes."

10:21:13 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What if I built a beacon with parts I made myself."

10:21:20 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "All yourself?"

10:21:25 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Me and Eli."

10:21:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No orgs involved?"

10:21:45 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "None."

10:21:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah we both contribued parts, I think that means we'll be able to change it."

10:22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess the question is, can Best change it?"

10:22:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In that case, my best assumption would be that it would be only you and he that could change it."

10:22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cause that would be major egg on our face."

10:22:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can come test that theory in a bit if you like, to make sure."

10:22:35 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Please do."

10:23:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Seriously? You want to work for me with a productivity of 34?"

10:24:00 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right. Um...where is this thing I'm testing?"

10:24:04 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That's only on my good days. It's usually lower."

10:24:07 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Hire me, bitch."

10:24:15 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Fuck all that. Lazy ass."

10:24:26 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Providence gate."

10:24:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not that I think another pilot would mess with it."

10:25:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe if she can't change it, we can feel safe assuming no one but us can."

10:27:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

10:30:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey constantine, maybe leave the please turn back part off for now."

10:31:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

10:33:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Lily, I borrowed Herding Cats to put up some protest beacons. I didn't use any org funds to buy the parts, but if you're not comfortable with me doing this I can use a module scout in the future."

10:33:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I only used it because it's getting late and I thought it would be quicker this way."

10:33:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I could get some sleep."

10:33:41 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon at Riverway is now online!

10:33:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

10:33:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'd rather you used a module scout for that because it's easy to use modules not authorized."

10:34:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, that's a good point."

10:34:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry."

10:34:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

10:34:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also what's the purpose of this messsage beacon?"

10:34:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli and I wanted to try to discourage merchants from trading in AEU ports."

10:35:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

10:35:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok and did you go deploy the Asteroid Processor? It's in the Constructor."

10:35:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I did."

10:36:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

10:36:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Tr org thanks so much for that and I just woke up briefly so going back to sleep. Talk with you later."

10:36:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No prob, have a good sleep."

10:38:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'll use my module scout to replace these if I have to in the future. Lily raised the good point that I might accidentally attach the wrong part and make someone an unwitting contributor."

10:38:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

10:38:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "By the way since the Constructor is my own personal starship, I'm not so sure that I support what Eli is wanting to do. So please us your own or Eli's ship if interfering is what he is after."

10:38:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I understand. Sorry Lily."

10:38:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right on."

10:40:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can give you a key to my constructor too, I don't keep any spare parts on there."

10:40:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see your new Providence message Eli. I'll change the Cheyanne and Riverway ones to that."

10:40:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, that would be good."

10:40:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually yeah, if you like that I'm already in Riverway I can just change this one too."

10:40:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, yeah, I like yours better. I'll get the Cheyanne one."

10:41:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I accidently cleared it and couldn't remember exactly what it said."

10:43:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I think we're set."

10:46:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're going all in on the strike guys. No work at all. Only defending against threats to humanity. We're in the home stretch every pilot that joins in will help."

10:48:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know it's not what you envisioned, Dak, but we may be out of the Accord within a week if nothing changes."

10:48:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I also encourage you all to politely disuade merchants from trading. We've set up some message beacons but it's still good for us to be there in person."

10:48:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course it's all voluntary, we can't make anyone do anything."

10:50:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "None of us will hold it against you if you choose not to, though if you joined it would be helpfull."

10:51:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm going to assume the both of you are talking to me, since nobody else is really around."

Please join me in officially welcoming Okinaj Sei and Aldis Whylita to the corps -- we're glad to have you and look forward to working with you. On another note, as we all know, the current political climate in the Union is troubled at best. The first thing I'm going to do is check on the status of the Accord negotiations and report my findings to you. If any of you have any ideas, comments, or suggestions about, or simply want to discuss our current predicament, please contact me. My office door will always be open while I'm awake (at least figuratively, feel free to ask me to meet in my office at any time), and you can reach me at either my personal (0010-18851) or office number (0010-89705).

You can go east, southeast, and out.

10:53:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

10:53:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

10:53:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

10:54:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

10:54:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:54:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:54:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:54:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:54:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

10:54:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:54:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:54:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:54:22 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:54:23 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:54:28 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

10:54:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:54:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:54:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:54:33 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:54:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

10:54:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:54:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:54:38 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

10:54:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I understand that, I just thought it was worth asking."

10:54:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

10:54:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll catch you guys later."

10:54:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:54:56 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

10:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Goodnight constantine."

10:55:00 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

10:55:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

10:55:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

10:55:12 You pull a large lever towards you.

10:55:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:31:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Quantum Skim Accelerator to The Cross.

11:31:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:32:02 [Starship "North Star"; Control Room]

11:32:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair and a large leather couch here.
Ali Candan is sitting on a black leather captain's chair.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:37:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector W-62."

11:37:38 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:37:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:37:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:37:42 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

12:23:24 You can't go that way.

12:23:26 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]

12:23:26 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a swiveling dark green leather gunner's chair and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go west.

12:23:36 a dark green leather captain's chair

12:23:36 This state of the art starship captain's chair is upholstered in dark green leather and has a polished steel frame. The high back, seat, and armrests are firmly but deeply padded to mitigate the vibrations, shaking, and sudden changes of velocity of both normal starship operations and combat. The chair swivels smoothly from side to side to provide an extended reach of control room instrument panels.
There is nothing on there.

12:35:39 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

12:36:58 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

12:36:59 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:37:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:37:01 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:37:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:37:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:37:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:37:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

12:37:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:37:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:37:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:37:49 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:37:50 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

12:37:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:37:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:37:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:37:54 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:37:57 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:38:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:38:40 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

12:38:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

12:38:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:38:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:38:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:38:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:50:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:50:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:50:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

12:50:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:50:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:50:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:51:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:51:37 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

12:51:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

12:51:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

          Introduction

We have several types of Battlesuits to help us in our ground combat endeavors. While I am not going to go deep into details of ground combat in this book, I will touch on a few things. I will also talk a little bit about the various functions, module uses and drawbacks of these battlesuits.

The information given in this book is from my experience with ground combat work. I, in no way, am stating this to be absolute fact.

I hope that you will find something in the following pages that is of help to you.

          AEU Suit

This suit is your repair suit on most ground activities. You can get loads of repair abilities once you purchase the Minidrones module. They range from minor to major in the single and group categories as you gain access to higher tier suits. Regeneration and Squad Restoration are also among these abilities. These two abilities will repair in small doses over time.

If you are operating this suit, your primary goal is to repair. It is not to be firing the lasers while your crew leader is climbing steadily to high percentages of damage. If you begin repairs early, you may be able to prevent high amounts of damage to your leader. Doing this may also keep you from having to use the moderate or major repairs, which can cause opponents to look your way more often. In the event that you do need to use something higher than single person minor repairs, be careful. It's all about timing between the League and AEU suit operators in getting this down without having the AEU suit getting thumped. The logic of repairing early is very simple because maintaining a steady flow of repairs is better than having to play catch up and do big burst repairing in the middle of a fight.
The Sonics module is used heavily with this suit. You have many abilities to choose from. If a battle gets rough, you can knock out an opponent until you are ready to take it on, however, use this one wisely. There are also abilities that d
12:58:43 eal damage such as Reverb. Pulse is a good one for stunning and interrupting your target. Learning how and when to use these and other abilities such as Sonic Wave may or may not take some time. Pace yourself and learn what works best with the various opponents you will encounter. You can use the Sonics abilities to help in various ways of battle but don't forget your main objective. This is to keep the damage to a minimum.

13:01:28 A launch trajectory is located.

13:01:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:01:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:01:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

13:01:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:02:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:02:08 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:02:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

13:02:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:02:20 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Koclar". The organization has earned 1,995,616.21 credits and 1 megacredit.

13:02:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:02:28 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:02:28 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:02:28 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:04:44 You can't go that way.

13:04:45 [Starship "Misty Justice"; Control Room]

13:04:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

15:01:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton cheers.

15:01:19 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:01:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:01:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:01:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:01:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:01:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:01:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:01:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:01:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

15:01:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:01:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:01:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:01:44 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:01:45 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

15:01:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:01:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:01:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:01:49 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:01:51 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

15:01:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

15:01:52 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

15:01:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:02:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:02:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:02:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:02:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:02:24 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

15:02:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:02:25 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:02:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:02:27  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

15:02:27 You are carrying nothing.

15:02:31 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:02:36 You scramble to your feet.

15:02:36 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:02:37 You exit the ship.

15:02:58 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

15:02:58 You wave to Lexie Amarras.

15:03:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I'll go ahead and assume not New Earth."

15:03:06 Ali Candan speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

15:03:06 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Waiting on you, Aldis."

15:03:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Old Earth."

15:03:27 You hear the ringing of the nearby ferry and the answering calls of seagulls.

15:04:20 [Tactical Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Give me a moment, I'll need to make the jump. I'm looking over what I need to no longer be a cadet."

15:04:31 Lexie Amarras nods.

15:04:56 Ted Warburton says, "Good job there really isn't an invasion."

15:05:04 Lexie Amarras says, "Truth."

15:05:27 Lexie Amarras says, "I sometimes wonder if we're a little too complacent most days."

15:05:54 Ali Candan removes a decoy beacon from a black canvas gear bag.

15:06:03 Ted Warburton says, "Kind of hard to get a crew at all at this time most days."

15:06:08 You nod.

15:06:15 Lexie Amarras says, "Hope the outsiders don't figure that out."

15:06:23 Lexie Amarras stretches.

15:06:23 Ted Warburton says, "Exactly."

15:06:38 [Tactical Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Entering orbit now."

15:06:48 You say, "That's ok. They'll just feel the wrath of my flare."

15:06:53 Ted Warburton says, "I remember once, Ali and I went to GMG and we were literally the only two awake after a while."

15:06:54 Lexie Amarras grins at you.

15:06:54 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray".

15:07:09 Lexie Amarras says, "I hear you. I've been on at times when it's been like that."

15:07:11 Ted Warburton asks, "What even is one of those?"

15:07:14 Ali Candan stands up from a cushy booth seat.

15:07:18 You ask, "A flare?"

15:07:19 You follow Ali Candan out.

15:10:47 
[Starship "Kartal"; Weapons Room Two]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert.

[Starship "Kartal"; Weapons Room One]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair here.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

15:37:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "You retreat and fight another day. Simple, yet effective."

15:37:31 Ted says to you, "Wow, you're getting loads of cadets."

15:37:36 You say, "Yeah."

15:37:39 You grin.

15:37:49 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

15:38:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Nah, I'll just jettison this cadet buoy first as a distraction."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

16:58:51 [Starship "William Dove"; "Hope"]]

16:58:51 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a silky electric blue cushion decorated with embroidered pale blue flowers, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Desiree the little black and white spotted CatBot, a large bubbling azure blue-lit aquarium containing violet and ocher aquatic life and round rocks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and Shule Elemmire's workbench here.
You can go east.

16:58:55 You can't go that way.

17:11:19 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

17:16:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:16:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:16:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

17:16:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

17:16:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:16:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:16:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:16:31 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:16:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:16:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:16:34 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

17:16:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:16:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:16:36 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:16:39 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

17:16:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "We were going to move all of alliance space while you were gone."

17:16:54 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Good."

17:16:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd like to see you try."

17:17:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Would be quite entertaining to watch."

17:17:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:17:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:17:27 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:17:31 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What, me, in a spacesuit, franticly pushing against a planet screaming at it to fucking move already?"

17:17:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:17:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:17:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, that."

17:17:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:17:47 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:18:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Much more likely you'd just burn up in the atmosphere though."

17:18:04 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Come to the lounge."

17:18:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Can't yet."

17:18:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. Didn't see the headline fore we left."

17:18:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

17:18:58 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I know, right?"

17:19:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:19:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:19:13 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They did such an amazing job."

17:19:24 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Tremendous."

17:19:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

17:19:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...it was predicted...ahem."

17:19:43 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

17:19:57 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I did say the other day. I should have bet money on it."

17:20:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well, hindsight, I guess."

17:20:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not sure anybody woulda taken your bet."

17:20:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The AEU strike people."

17:20:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They seemed to think they were doing greatly."

17:21:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule, I don't know if you've talked to Eli, but he's now calling for a full-blown strike on all activity."

17:21:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Other than defense against invasions."

17:22:04 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's all because that Fring power couple told them to work throught he strike."

17:22:11 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Fringe even."

17:22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, nobody told me that."

17:22:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He told me very early this morning."

17:22:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also set up message beacons in our hub sectors to try to dissuade passing merchants from trading in our ports."

17:23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I'm on the scanner looking for merchant activity, hoping I can catch them in our sectors and ask them not to trade."

17:23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, that's what those message beacons are for? They don't seem to be listening to them."

17:23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nicely, of course."

17:23:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, maybe not. I haven't seen a single merchant pass while I've been awake regardless, though."

17:23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I've seen them all day over my terminal."

17:24:06 Not much to see out there.

17:24:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I've only been awake for about 20 minutes."

17:24:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Darn, wish I had known earlier. I did a beacon today."

17:25:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that's okay. Maybe I'll send a notice about it though, in case anyone else wants to join in."

17:25:59 Vernos Bailey does not seem to have an active communicator.

17:27:45 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

17:33:05 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm going on strike for the next 45 minutes to make a point. The point needing that I need sleep."

17:33:10 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

17:33:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

17:33:25 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So I'll be salvaging if anyone needs me, okay?"

17:33:58 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "See that amazing consistency right there."

17:34:15 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That was if I was a member of the AEU. Luckaly for me, I'm not, so bye!"

17:34:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rest well Erik."

17:34:56 You glance at your communicator's screen.

17:34:56 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, just a notice that the strike is now a full-blown strike on all activity. No beacons, no nests, no artifacting, nothing at all, save for responding to invasions. It of course has to remain voluntary, but I'd like to encourage everyone to take part. The Union will leave the Accord soon if nothing changes. [15:27 22 August 2317 GST]

17:59:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Have you been watching the terminal? I haven't seen any merchant activity in the past hour on my scanner."

18:00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is surprising, when I was SDC I felt like the merchants never stopped."

18:04:33 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Consider not delivering goods to AEU ports."

18:04:39 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just a suggestion, I know I can't stop you."

18:04:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't done that in awhile."

18:04:58 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoever that is."

18:05:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No clue who you're talkin to Constantine."

18:05:27 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just saw some courier activity in Telex and Aenea."

18:05:35 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe it wasn't a civilian pilot, sorry."

18:05:47 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'm not delivering goods. It's reports."

18:05:54 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Fair enough, just a suggestion."

18:05:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Only way we can not do that with courier ships is to not courier at all, which hurts everyone."

18:11:38 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But if you were considering it, not getting their reports would probably irk them all the same. That's the last I'll say about it, sorry."

18:11:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But then no one would get reports Constantine."

18:12:00 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I get that."

18:12:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We can't pick our destinations."

18:12:05 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys will do what you want, obviously."

18:12:35 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was less talking about that, and more about the goods/reports distinction."

18:12:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Same deal there."

18:12:53 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

18:12:58 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes, I hear what you're saying."

18:13:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If we don't deliver goods to AEU ports, no one gets goods. Not League, not Fringe, not Mutuality, not EAOS, nobody."

18:13:14 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes, I understand."

18:13:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Y'all need to work out your own issues internally, seems to me. We can't fix it for ya."

18:13:34 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

18:13:38 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks."

18:13:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yhep."

18:25:31 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Do we consider not diverting Outsider patrols something that can potentially hurt everyone?"

18:25:37 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just curious."

18:25:43 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We don't know what the patrols might stumble on."

18:25:54 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I do know we have been berated and laughed at for continuing to do it, though."

18:26:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We only do it in one area, and if the few of you over there stopped doing it, there wouldn't be that many stopped."

18:26:10 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Can we be sure?"

18:26:17 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's great if you're sure it won't be a problem."

18:26:18 [General Communication] James Singh transmits, "Hi."

18:26:20 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm just not sure how you know."

18:26:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno. How many beacons have y'all done?"

18:26:25 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No idea."

18:26:30 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How many patrols does it take to be a problem?"

18:26:47 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, fighting with you will just feed the headlines. I'll assume you know."

18:26:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Constantine, I ain't here to argue with ya. Y'all just gotta fix your issue's all I know."

18:26:53 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And just follow your lead."

18:27:05 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Because I don't know."

18:31:04 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But just out of curiousity, do you know it can't cause a problem?"

18:31:52 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like you do, but that wasn't obvious to me."

18:51:41 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:51:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:02:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:02:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:02:02 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:02:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:02:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:02:13 There are no other ships in the sector.

20:02:15 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

20:02:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:02:18 Which sector did you mean?

20:02:18 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

20:02:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:02:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:02:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

20:02:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:02:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:02:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:02:26 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: uq7Tc^jCp/[32-$^ckYMe{fDn'h)ri5q;5nl0%GP
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:02:27 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

20:02:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:02:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:02:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:02:31 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:02:32 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

20:02:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:02:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:02:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:02:36 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:02:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

20:02:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:02:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:02:44 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:06:42 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "It will always be a mystery."

20:06:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:06:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:06:52 [General Communication] James Singh transmits, "Mysteries are fun."

20:06:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:06:55 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:06:55 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:06:57 I don't understand that.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Compaq" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

20:07:27 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:10:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep, review."

20:12:19 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

20:12:29 The vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk" touches down smoothly on the ground.

20:12:31 The reactionless drive of the vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

20:12:32 Patriot Constantine Stone exits from the vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk".

20:12:32 The vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

20:12:33 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I am amused."

20:12:34 Patriot Constantine Stone waves.

20:12:38 You wave to Patriot Constantine Stone.

20:12:43 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

20:12:43 You see a large number of stored starships here.
Aldis Whylita is standing here.
You can go up.
Patriot Constantine Stone followed you.

20:12:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

20:12:46 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Patriot Constantine Stone followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:12:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:12:46 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
Patriot Constantine Stone followed you.

20:13:25 You say, "So, I wanted to let you know. I don't know if you've gotten clarification or not, but we don't have access to any upgrades on the other side of the skims."

20:13:35 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

20:13:38 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I didn't realize that."

20:13:41 You say, "It's not just the skims we lost access to."

20:13:41 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "That's unfortunate."

20:13:50 You nod.

20:13:51 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Okay, that's good to know."

20:14:02 You say, "Yeah."

20:14:08 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I did ask the liaison office some things about the meeting we had with Lambeth, but they haven't responded yet."

20:14:13 You say, "They made it sound like it was just the skims."

20:14:16 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, they did."

20:14:17 You nod to Patriot Constantine Stone.

20:14:35 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Huh, that's disappointing. I wonder why they weren't up front about that."

20:14:45 You say, "Yeah, me too."

20:14:56 You say, "Honestly, I'm not very happy."

20:15:00 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:15:02 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Neither am I."

20:15:07 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I'm not sure what we can do."

20:15:22 You say, "Me neither, but Eli should know, as well as Ather."

20:15:26 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:15:38 You say, "I tried to get upgrades for my flare."

20:15:42 You gesture vaguely.

20:15:49 Patriot Constantine Stone sighs.

20:15:51 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "What a mess."

20:15:57 You exclaim, "No kidding!"

20:15:57 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't really see a way out of this, either."

20:16:11 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Everything we do seems to put us further in the hole."

20:16:16 You say, "Yeah, me neither."

20:16:38 You say, "Well, thing is, we need every civilian pilot to go on strike, not just some of us."

20:16:42 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:16:53 Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "I agree, but is that realistic?"

20:17:03 You say, "Probably not."

20:17:05 You sigh.

20:17:07 Patriot Constantine Stone says, OOCly, "I'm worried it's unrealistic to expect new pilots to, for ooc reasons, but I don't know how to handle that."

20:17:31 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Dakhal isn't striking, citing his holding the whip position as a reason."

20:17:34 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I wish he would reconsider."

20:17:41 You say, OOCly, "It's tough. They want the points and don't worry about rpl."

20:18:04 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I've tried talking to him, and so has Eli, but I don't really think he's having it."

20:18:15 You say, "Well, what I would tell him is that if we leeave the Accord, he won't have a civilian corps to be whip for."

20:18:19 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "It might be helpful if others who have been whip could tell him that being whip is more about observing and analyzing trends."

20:18:28 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But I don't know if that's true, or who could explain that."

20:18:37 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "That's definitely true."

20:18:46 You say, "I've been whip before."

20:18:52 You say, "So has Lily."

20:18:55 Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "Maybe you could talk to him?"

20:18:58 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Lily too."

20:19:08 You say, "I could try."

20:19:28 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Not doing beacons still bugs me, honestly."

20:19:33 You say, "Also, one more thing."

20:19:37 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't like the idea of not sending every one of those bastards home in pods."

20:19:42 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But if that's what we're doing, I'm in."

20:19:45 You say, "I know."

20:20:18 You ask, "I think Ather donated his cruiser to the Accord. If the AEu withdraws from the Accord, what's going to happen to his cruiser?"

20:20:33 Patriot Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:20:53 You say, "It was donated so that it could be equipped with pdb shielding, I think."

20:20:54 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't know that. I could try asking them over at the Accord. I have a couple pending inquiries already, so it might take a while."

20:21:09 You nod.

20:21:40 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I've been in Endymion orbit picketing."

20:21:43 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "An idea Eli had."

20:21:48 You say, "Ah, ok."

20:21:55 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "To try to urge merchant ships not to trade."

20:22:00 You nod.

20:22:02 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't know that it's working."

20:22:06 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't really want to threaten them."

20:22:09 You say, "It doesn't seem like it."

20:22:17 You say, "Neither do I."

20:23:23 You say, "Anyways, I wanted to tell you about the upgrades."

20:23:28 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:23:30 You say, "Or the lack of them."

20:23:54 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Well, I asked them to clarify their stance on assuring the Mutuality of their non-aggression."

20:24:00 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't expect a definitive response."

20:24:03 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But I asked all the same."

20:24:05 You nod.

20:24:08 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I'll let you guys know whatever I find."

20:24:15 You say, "Well, at least you asked and ok."

20:24:17 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:24:31 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Alright, I'm going to take a break for a bit."

20:24:36 You say, "Ok."

20:24:38 Patriot Constantine Stone waves.

20:24:39 You wave.

20:24:40 Patriot Constantine Stone walks out.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:25:08 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:25:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:25:10 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:25:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:25:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:25:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:45:03 You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are clean and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

Star Conquest Help: Starship Decoration and Maintenance

Category: Game Systems

Starships can be decorated, repainted, and re-lettered to customize their look! They will also acquire rust, scorch marks, and fade as they are used, so it's up to you to maintain them if you want them looking nice.

As of this writing, degradation in your ship's appearance does not in fact reflect any malfunction in your ship's performance.

Starship Decoration

First of all, you can buy paint and lettering stencils at your local starship supply store. To repaint your ship, type PAINT [ship] WITH PAINT.

If you want to change your ship's lettering, then you simply use that same PAINT command while holding the stencils you want to use.

You can also apply additions to your ship such as spikes, chains, antennas, and other things, as well as decals. To do this, type USE [decoration] WITH [ship].

Plaques can be engraved with the ETCH [plaque] command. Be careful, you only have one shot at etching it!

Decorations and decals can also be painted, but they must be painted before they are applied, or it will be too late!

Starship Maintenance

The appearance of your ship will degrade over time, as you use it. It will also acquire the marks of having been in battle. You can fix all of these things with cleaning supplies from your local starship supply store.

To clean your ship with a cleaning item, type USE [item] WITH [shi
20:53:26 p].

Checking Out Starships

With all this customizing going on, you want to make sure you go ahead and LOOK at other people's ships! Want to check out a ship that's in space? No problem! Type the VISUAL command in your ship's control room, and it will handily zoom in and provide you with a perfect view!

20:54:00 I don't understand that.

20:54:06 Do you want to repaint your ship's title with a set of flaming lettering stencils? [Enter `yes' or `no']

20:54:10 You apply a set of flaming lettering stencils to the hull of the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" and carefully paint the ship's title metallic yellow.

20:54:19 the two-person flare "Deadly Strike"

20:54:19 You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in flaming metallic yellow letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is gleaming and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:55:49 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:55:49 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:55:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:55:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:55:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:55:54 This will not work unless the ship is in a sector.

20:55:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:55:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:57:46 Would you like to request docking clearance for The Torus (Dock Alpha)?

20:57:46 [Enter `yes' or `no']

20:57:48 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

20:57:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:57:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:58:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:58:08 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:58:25 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:58:25 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:58:30 Recent Minor Changes:

-----
Arachnopals no longer transcend time and space, and now cannot move in directions beyond our comprehension.
   Posted 6 days, 1 hour, 8 minutes, and 19 seconds ago
-----
At long last, the STANDINGS command now gives far greater detail than a simple like or dislike! 

Please look forward to new additions to this system in the future.
   Posted 4 days, 17 hours, 41 minutes, and 53 seconds ago
-----
Battlesuit energy may now be checked through roundtime.
   Posted 3 days, 18 hours, and 56 minutes ago
-----
Ships that are unable to salvage (fighters, certain transports, etc) can no longer deploy atmospheric scoops. This was a bit of an oversight, and we deeply apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.

Atmospheric scoops on ships that can no longer do so, of course, be transferred off.
   Posted 3 days, 10 hours, 26 minutes, and 43 seconds ago
-----
Implemented a fix for ground enemies who fail to react after a failed encounter is regenerated. Be sure to send a support ticket if you notice this still happening.
   Posted 3 days, 28 minutes, and 10 seconds ago
-----
The Commissar's report for deleted players in the Mutuality should now sound somewhat less ominous.
   Posted 2 days, 3 hours, 49 minutes, and 15 seconds ago
-----
The minimum payment for a fine is now one million credits or one fifth of the fine amount, whichever is smaller.

This will have the effect of reducing the financ
20:58:30 ial strain on people with moderate to severe fines, as previously it was simply one fifth of the fine amount, regardless of how large the fine was. In certain instances this means the minimum payment would reach into the tens of millions or higher.
   Posted 1 day, 9 hours, 44 minutes, and 55 seconds ago
-----
Cadets can no longer use the fund center.
   Posted 1 day, 4 hours, 35 minutes, and 40 seconds ago
-----
A few ground combat changes:

- Spinward suits no longer get gravitics. This made them somewhat too powerful and took away from the Fringe suit's unique flavour.
- Spinward suits now get blades instead, which are more comparable in damage to projectiles and rely on swift strikes. Rules of nature!
   Posted 16 hours, 16 minutes, and 6 seconds ago
-----
The RUNDOWN command now displays a starship's controlling faction in place of its starmap symbol.

20:58:57 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:59:16 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Vertical Wing". The organization has earned 204,965.83 credits.

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Howdy space bus driver."

21:02:15 Are you using MTTS to ask for a hint for a quest or newly-added game mechanic? [Enter `yes' or `no']

21:02:17 Are you using MTTS to report a bug or exploit? [Enter `yes' or `no']

21:02:20 Is your message addressed to the staff, or part of an ongoing conversation with the staff? [Enter `yes' or `no']

21:02:21 [MTTS] siekanas: I actually think I preferred the starmap symbol, but that could change.

21:02:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Much better. My ship is small and meant for hauling salvage, but it's mine."

21:02:52 [MTTS] davetaylor: It's really helpful for us screen reader users on the rundown, seriously, thanks.

21:03:07 [MTTS] usfolks: Or anyone that can't visually use a starmap for whatever reason.

21:03:24 [MTTS] siekanas: I can't use the starmap either.

21:03:53 [MTTS] usfolks: Previously the only ways to get that was to scan each ship, or to use the starmap and look at the bottom, which meant a lot of stuff to wade through first. So this makes it a lot easier.

21:05:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have never seen so many blueprints on the market."

21:05:12 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,085,650.21 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

21:05:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My debris, danged rats."

21:07:36 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo."

21:07:41 [MTTS] siekanas: I'm not saying it isn't useful, but I'm just saying I prefer to know the ship-classes.

21:07:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yo Rogue."

21:08:01 [MTTS] usfolks: Was that what it was? It just always seemed like a random letter or symbol to me.

21:08:15 [MTTS] voyager1000: I thought it was a random character too.

21:08:22 [MTTS] siekanas: No, it isn't. It actually gave you a hint as to the ship-class.

21:08:48 [MTTS] davetaylor: I always wondered what it was, it seemed random to me.

21:09:02 [MTTS] usfolks: I had no idea. The only thing I'd like better than it saying League or Fringe is L, F, A, M, or whatever so it was shorter.

21:09:19 [MTTS] usfolks: But that's just because of my own issues that few other players have.

21:10:07 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Hello Rogue."

21:10:20 [MTTS] siekanas: And whenn you look at the rundown from say the DSC terminal, we're going to have to look at the starmap too to figure out what ship-classes are there so we can put together an appropriate reesponse.

21:10:33 [MTTS] usfolks: The what terminal?

21:10:38 [MTTS] usfolks: Also, just hit SHIPC.

21:11:03 [MTTS] siekanas: The SDC terminal. And you can't hit shipc from the terminal inside the SDC's office.

21:11:10 [MTTS] usfolks: OH! Sorry!

21:11:28 [MTTS] Butchulla: This will be cool to see. Thanks for the change, hosts. Belatedly, thanks for the change related to the shortening of organizations names that are on station parts. That really makes life a ton easier.

21:11:31 [MTTS] usfolks: Thought it was something client-specific there. My apologies.

21:15:31 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Magnetic Fields". The organization has earned 1,853,516.89 credits.

21:15:36 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:24:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Resting in my ship is the order of the day."

21:24:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Though I need to get a sofa for another ship."

21:24:59 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I need a sofa!"

21:25:11 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Go buy one."

21:25:12 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There are a few choices."

21:25:22 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I'm going to go get one!"

21:25:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I painted my ship, and helped Shule make an important choice for his own."

21:25:32 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Woo."

21:25:40 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Rogue."

21:25:44 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

21:25:44 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:25:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Howdy Ryo."

21:25:48 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Ardsley has some nice overstuffed ones."

21:25:50 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo Shule."

21:26:07 You exit the ship.

21:26:07 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

21:26:11 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:26:11 You can go out and enter into the ship.

You can go south, up, and out.

21:26:12 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Howdy morris."

21:26:13 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yup, they got tons of colors to choose from also."

21:26:13 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:26:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:26:23 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "That's where I'm currently headed."

21:26:25 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:26:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:26:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:26:33 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I also like that one in landfall."

21:26:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "#i and stuff."

21:31:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

21:31:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:31:13 [General Communication] Rogue Romano chuckles.

21:31:21 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm getting ready to write my letter right now, Emily."

21:31:29 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Emily, can I date yur coffee dispenser?"

21:31:30 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Dispenser on standby."

21:31:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't tell Lily."

21:31:56 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Hold up Lexie, I'm not made of coffee dispensers."

21:31:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

21:32:00 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Oh Lily? You around?"

21:32:02 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I don't like coffee though, it's probably a bad idea. I think I'll pass."

21:32:09 [General Communication] Rogue Romano snickers.

21:32:58 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "You got that right."

21:32:59 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I don't know. Taras are good to have."

21:33:04 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I'm glad to know i'm not the only one who isn't a fan of coffee."

21:33:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:33:07 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:33:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Misty Justice. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:33:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:33:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I drink it occasionally, but I'm much more a tea guy."

21:33:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:33:24 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels whistles.

21:33:28 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:33:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:33:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:33:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wut."

21:33:32 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Well, Tara still has to clean out my cargo hold of juicy Bari bits sooner or later."

21:33:34 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo beautiful."

21:33:37 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Mel's hot for dispensers, apparently."

21:33:54 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I perfer my cola for a caffine boost."

21:33:58 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "How can y'all compare a dispenser to Tara. Have you gone blind?"

21:34:01 Your ship 'Misty Justice' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:34:05 [General Communication] Rogue Romano laughs.

21:34:15 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

21:34:21 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I've never seen Tara, although the sound from a dispenser... never mind."

21:34:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I wasn't. I said Taras are good to have. I have no lust for dispensers. I have all the dispensers I need."

21:34:40 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh so you are lusting for Tara?"

21:34:46 [General Communication] Okinaj whispers, "All, the dispensers..."

21:34:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:34:52 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Not particularly. But she's good company."

21:35:05 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Where is a good place to get a dispenser?"

21:35:14 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Hyperion."

21:35:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Hyperion, Jacktown."

21:35:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Place on hyperion in jacktown."

21:35:21 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "From Lexie apparently."

21:35:28 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And in case you missed it, Hyperion."

21:35:33 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hmm interesting notion I could auction my dispensers."

21:35:47 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Jacktown it is, then!"

21:35:49 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There are a few good coffee places you can visit too, one on Centauri, and one on proper earth."

21:36:18 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You can get coffees not made by the dispensers."

21:36:27 [General Communication] "As opposed to improper Earth?" Morris Corlew laughs.

21:36:39 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Right, improper earth."

21:36:44 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Well there we go. A dark red sofa, with a cinabar red and amethyst throw pillow, a leaf green cashmere blanket, and a second throw pill the same color as the first on it."

21:36:59 [Starship "Misty Justice"; Airlock]

21:36:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:37:00 You exit the ship.

21:37:00 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

21:37:05 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Cool."

21:37:07 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

21:37:08 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:37:08 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:37:09 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "And people say I"m random."

21:37:15 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Beware lewd earth, though."

21:37:19 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Well, you'll not be able to trip over that first thing in the morning with bleary vision."

21:37:26 [General Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "Hey no earth is better than new earth!"

21:37:26 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "You will always be random, Lex."

21:37:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's quite arguable."

21:38:06 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Which the couch, or me being random?"

21:38:11 [General Communication] Ryo Stel laughs. "I know it is."

21:38:15 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Perhaps, both?"

21:38:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No, no earth bein better than new earth."

21:38:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh that."

21:38:28 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Surely if a person is random frequently enough, it stops being random."

21:38:29 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, or none of the above."

21:38:53 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Probably. But I don't really aim for random. People just accuse me of it."

21:38:58 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "A consistency of random."

21:39:19 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Random consistency?"

21:39:39 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Not really, if you are random frequently enough, you'd be consistently random."

21:39:52 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Hmm."

21:40:08 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Random consistency sounds more like bowel trouble."

21:40:18 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or maybe randomly consistent?"

21:40:31 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Still sounds like bowel trouble."

21:40:42 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

21:40:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There once were some pilots random, who horrified coms damn them, we don't mind the chatter, but our eardrums are."

21:40:58 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Damnit ran out of my thought."

21:41:02 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras laughs.

21:41:05 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I think Lexie fell ov... oh."

21:41:12 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

21:41:13 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "That train of thought derailed and took out a village."

21:41:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ahh got it."

21:42:06 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There were some pilots random, who transmitted on coms damn them, we don't mind the chatter, but our ear drums are battered, so there must some way to ban them."

21:42:48 [General Communication] Okinaj transmits a slow, clapping noise.

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:50:30 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Aaah. It's no cola, but some hot chocolate is fine with me."

21:50:49 There appear to be about 18 pilots recently active.

21:51:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:51:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

21:52:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:52:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:52:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:52:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:52:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:54:46 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
Sheets of tinted glass form a transparent window into the outside world around this crescent-shaped lounge, giving you a clear view to both the landing pad and the surrounding mountains and other Chetumalian scenery. Comfortable couches are spaced in neat clusters for pilots to sit in as they socialize and are brought refreshments by the attractive waitresses. Scattered close to the groups of couches are multiple holovids tuned to the latest news, captions scrolling around the edges. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

22:13:14 the two-person flare "Deadly Strike"
It appears to be at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in flaming metallic yellow letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:13:51 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

22:13:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:13:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:13:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:13:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:13:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:14:07 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Compaq" has landed on the planet New Earth.

22:14:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:14:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:14:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:14:21 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:14:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

22:15:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:15:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:20:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:20:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:20:11 The ship is already moving.

22:20:12 The ship is already moving.

22:20:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:20:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:20:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:20:14 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:20:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:20:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:20:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:20:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:20:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:20:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:20:24 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

22:20:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:20:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:20:26 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:20:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:20:35 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

22:20:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:20:57 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I think we aught to stop saying things like, oh well it's just RATS and start destroying."

22:21:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

22:21:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:21:13 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:21:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:21:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:21:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:21:33 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:21:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:21:37 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:21:38 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Fringies have been sweeping for them."

22:21:42 You peer out...

22:21:42 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

22:22:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Looks like I should invest in a fighter in the future."

22:22:07 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The fringe has been doing that exact thing. As often as we can. We go find them. And pop them. Johann has helped too I think."

22:22:09 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:22:19 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Think so yes."

22:22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Fighters are good to have. I still have a standard fighter."

22:22:59 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Well I've destroyed plenty of them in Orion."

22:23:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We go to places they usually tend to hang out, and pop away."

22:23:44 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yeah Orion is one of those places."

22:23:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I make a point of checking cadet probable sectors first personally."

22:24:41 You switch a flight control scanner on.

22:24:57 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Endymion flight control here, an AEU transport is about to land."

22:25:27 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Earthgate to Earthgate flight control, a League transport has jumped in."

22:32:00 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Old Earth Orbit flight control, this is Old Earth, League transport on an incoming trajectory.  Clear the pad."

22:32:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Good thing they've been making fun of us for doing nests."

22:32:08 You switch a flight control scanner off.

22:32:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We wouldn't want to control the size of the horde."

22:33:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Luckily the good folks over at space Vermin command I'm sure will be keeping a close eye on things."

22:33:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There are a lot of justifications one can give in order to perform one activity or the other. If we do decoy beacon drops, it might cut down the Outsider fleet. If we do RATS nests it will cut down the horde. What most people fail to consider is the fact that the RATS seem to be able to reproduce at an alarming rate, and Outsiders have construction vastly beyond ours to the point that we can likely make no dent whatsoever in either fleet as things currently stand."

22:34:12 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes, the SVC ran by?"

22:34:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're right. Doing nothing certainly can't help, though. But I'm not arguing against the strike, I'm just miffed that these jerks are presuming to know what it's okay for us to not do."

22:35:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "When really, I don't think any of us know that it will be okay if we don't do these things."

22:35:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "A single Outsider patrol that we didn't stop could go on to find Helios after taking a lunch break, for all we know."

22:35:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Have attempts been made to try to talk to the merchant fleets landing on New Earth or other AEU planets to encourage them to find their exports or deliver their imports elsewhere?"

22:36:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli and I set up beacons to try to dissuade them from trading in our ports, and I spend some time in Endymion orbit trying to discourage some transports for a few hours."

22:36:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It hasn't been effective thus far."

22:36:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Unfortunately they'll likely have a lot less budget to do it with fairly soon."

22:36:55 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup."

22:37:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I'm about to head back up here in a minute, just waking up a bit more."

22:37:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, I'm not at all fond of this message beacon system. After a while, those messages become so repetative that they'll probably stop listening to them like I tend to pretty much completely ignore any of the greeting messages when I enter into a sector."

22:37:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Unless somethin's changed that ain't made the news, which I'd love to hear right bout now."

22:37:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would say don't rely on those stupid things at all. They're not personal enough to show we're serious."

22:37:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're still doing it in our ships too, that's just for what we don't catch or for when we're not up there."

22:37:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm going to go up over new earth too. I've got some time now."

22:38:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think the transports were certainly respond if we asked them to leave the sector, but they might view that as a threat, and I don't know if I'm comfortable with threatening transports."

22:38:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Would respond, that is."

22:38:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We sat in front of New Earth for a long tmie last night with no merchants at all, and 3 of them went to Aenea and back out in tha ttimeframe."

22:38:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And three visits to bikura as well."

22:38:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't threaten, then."

22:38:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What I started doing Eli is jumping to sectors where they landed, and catching them on the way out."

22:38:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't have to threaten!"

22:39:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah no threatening, just convincing."

22:39:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, I gotta take a break for a bit, then I'll rejoin you guys up there."

22:39:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Thanks constantine."

22:44:30 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:44:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:57:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:57:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:57:21 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:57:25 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

22:57:25 
AEU capsule "Icarus" departed to AEU sector Telex Orbit (Alpha-1) approximately 3 minutes ago.

22:57:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:57:32 Which sector did you mean?

22:57:32 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)

22:57:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

22:57:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:57:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:57:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:57:42 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:58:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:58:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:58:42  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

23:28:40 For a shop supposedly catering to craftsmen, this small store is surprisingly lacking the expected tools of the trade. Instead, the clean, orderly shelves display a variety of pristine workbenches and toolkits, as well as a license dispenser on the counter at the back of the room.
You see a trash can here.
You can go out.

23:28:44  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

23:28:45 You are carrying Shule Elemmire's workbench in your right hand.

23:39:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:39:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:39:04 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:39:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:39:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:39:17 The ship is already moving.

23:39:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:39:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:39:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:39:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:39:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:39:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:39:28 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:39:29 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:39:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:39:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:39:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:39:33 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:39:36 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:39:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:39:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:39:56 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:40:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:40:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:40:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:40:13 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:40:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
