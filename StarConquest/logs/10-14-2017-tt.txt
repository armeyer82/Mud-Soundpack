Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has olive skin. Her body is thin with curved hips and shapely calves. She has
narrow shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is round and
pretty, with a hooked nose and round chin. Her lips are sneering and pale and
occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked
eyebrows, her eyes are black and round. Her mid-back length, straight hair is
dark Irish red and neatly combed. She has short red fingernails.
 She is wearing a sleeveless royal blue cotton top with a scooped neckline and a
three-button front, a softly gathered skirt of royal blue cotton with a swirling
pattern of tiny transparent beads around the hem, a pair of white socks, and a
pair of black patent leather stilettos. She is also wearing a keychain, a
message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a flight control scanner,
a stylish black leather handbag bearing a large slashing Z, a metachannel FTL
communicator and watch, an alliance information assistant, and a temporary space
station reference device. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both

Cadet Katie Celayla
She appears to be 19 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has olive skin. Her body is thin with curved hips and shapely calves. She has
narrow shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is round and
pretty, with a hooked nose and round chin. Her lips are sneering and pale and
occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked
eyebrows, her eyes are black and round. Her mid-back length, straight hair is
dark Irish red and neatly combed. She has short red fingernails.
 She is wearing a sleeveless royal blue cotton top with a scooped neckline and a
three-button front, a softly gathered skirt of royal blue cotton with a swirling
pattern of tiny transparent beads around the hem, a pair of white socks, and a
pair of black patent leather stilettos. She is also wearing a keychain, a
message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a flight control scanner,
a stylish black leather handbag bearing a large slashing Z, a metachannel FTL
communicator and watch, an alliance information assistant, and a temporary space
station reference device. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both
forearms, both wrists, both hands, both thighs, both knees, and both calves are
left uncovered.
She is carrying a cup of hot American tea in her left hand.
Johnathon Triggs says, "EAOS will be my second suit. IF not an RATS suit."

gemini "Wayfarer" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Eaos are fun but they are not good for
everything."

You say to Johnathon, "Rats suits are not easy to get."
Lily says to Johnathon, "Also, you will have to do a special project to obtain a
Rats suit."
Johnathon Triggs says, "That's mostly why i'd get it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Those are very cool suits though."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

'But when  you're chained and atwo cruisers are beating on you, then be afraid.
You say, "But when you're chained and atwo cruisers are beating on you, then be
afraid."
A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the
two-person Accord gemini "Wayfarer" as it settles down upon the nearby landing
pad.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Oh my stars yes!"
Eli Grey just arrived.

Eli Grey says, "Ok, now I'm ready."
-eli Hi, I'm Shule.
You say to Eli, "Hi, I'm Shule."
Johnathon says to you, "Hey.. I have a /crazy/ idea... and I mean, /crazy? You
distract an IFS ship... it'll crack it's hull, board.. take out the crew.. and
well... we'll figure out the rest after that."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When we go into the Mule, then go to the
next room south and go down and enter the fort."
Johnathon says to Eli, "Ah ha! The blue bandit!"
Eli says to Johnathon, "And what if the IFS turn out to be blob-like slime
creatures and you instantly get absorbed."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Would oneof you please take Katie along

You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!
You can go east.

[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

figured. Some can only carry 15."
[Newbie Help] Alko Delovega transmits, "But why 50 specifically, while some
poachers takes more metals, like the hunter takes 100?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "When you have that lost from active
poachers line, it means that that's the number of metals you won't be payed for
if you were to end the site, even if they still happened to be there."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Like we said...it's jsut an average."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's just how the system figures it.

not telling them."

ways, much worse than I am. He has a sort of hipocritical holier than thou
attitude when it concerns others, but not himself. I'm an asshole in general,
but I'm an asshole to everyone who deserves it."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

Ather walks back to the table and glances briefly down at a stack of notes,
before clearing his throat with a mechanical cough.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Right, I just want to go through the
timeline, for our liaison here. I'm sure she's been kept up to speed, but just
for the sake of efficiency."
nod
You nod.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "As all of you know, members of the AEU
went to try to renegotiate access to the Quantum skims within the last several
months. The Mutuality council outright denied this request, due to the worry
that opening the QSA to civilian pilots would also invite attacks by AEU naval
forces. There were other concerns, but this seemed to be the biggest one."
Ather glances between Constantine and the others. "Am I correct in this
assumption as far as it goes?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
nod ather 'That is correct.
You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa. "That is correct."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Wonderful, wonderful."
Constantine Stone says, "I wasn't present at the meeting, but that's my
understanding of what happened."
Eli Grey nods. "Same here."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Well, regardless, opening the skims to
one faction instead of the other is just something which cannot be done, or so
they say."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "So, as you all know, in the first day of
my term as voice, I tried to push for a proposal requesting a guarantee of no
hostilities from the government. A proposal which was supported by 100% of the
pilots who voted for it. However, the government felt that as they see it, they
do not need to make any such guarantees. At least, that was the message
communicated to me by the liaison office."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard nods.
Ather turns to Antoinette and asks, "Mis Richard, can you elaborate on that any
further?"
Lily listens intently.
Johnathon looks from Ather to Antoinette.
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "What you're asking for is essentially a
one way non-aggression pact. We would be obliged to hold to a certain course of
action while the other party is not. I doubt the Union would be unique in not
entertaining such a proposal."
Constantine Stone asks, "Do you think the government would be amenable to a
mutual non-aggression pact?"
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "In the negotiation, Mis Richard, the
pilots would see to it that the Mutuality would also offer this guarantee."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
nod
You nod.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "There is no one-sided guarantee that's
trying to be made here. It would be a Mutual pact all the time. We don't attack
them, they don't attack us."
nod ather
You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Both the AEU and the Mutuality council
would offer this guarantee. However, the Mutuality council is concerned that the
AEU government is not offerring such a guarantee at the present time."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "If you can get a mutually beneficial set
of terms in writing, I'm sure the administration will give it all due
consideration."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Exactly."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "So noted."
Ather clears his throat as he continues.
Lily looks hopeful.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Meanwhile, I have been having some
discussions with some of the members of the Mutuality. Nothing has been decided,
but I did try to talk to them trying to see what kinds of things would help this
sort of situation. All of this pretty much brings me here tonight. The guarantee
issue we just covered thankfully, but this next one is one we will have to
consider, if we want to continue these negotiations."
Eli frowns thoughtfully.
Lily looks rather pensive.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I'll put it to you all straight. The
Mutuality believes that at present, we have nothing that we can really offer
them. No need for them to reopen the QSA to our pilots. They believe that due to
the threat posed by the AEU navy, they would have more to lose than to gain if
they opened up the QSA to us. Even if the government offerred them the guarantee
of no hostilities, they are not sure that they can trust it, because of the
current admbecause of current tensions in the AEU."
Constantine Stone nods.
Constantine Stone says, "I guess I wouldn't blame them."
nod and frown
You nod and frown.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Before any of you start spouting the
usual line about spending credits in their territories, let me tell you, that is
hardly of any concern to them. You can spend all the credits you want and
believe that you're contributing to what passes for their economy etc. However,
if the AEU navy decided to attack their space, people spending money at their
stations and giving their economy a boost will be their last concern, to be
honest."
Eli Grey nods.
nod 'That does make sense.
You nod. "That does make sense."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Let's face it. As things stand, they have
more to offer us than we do them. It is a position I had hoped to avoid, but it
is the honest truth. So, my question is this."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I certainly wouldn't with our Rogue Navy in
Tandem the other day and for other reasons."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "The Mutuality is already aware that we
have, as an alliance, broken all ties with Fleet Admiral Janus."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "An attack by her is not an attack by the
AEu navy. They know this."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "The question."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I have been monitoring general alliance
chatter. There has been a general amount of concern from civilian pilots who
worry that they cannot get their tactical platforms, as well as the Farport
technologies. I have my opinions about all of this, but those are not what we're
here to discuss."
nod ather
You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "As your voice, I want to know what you,
the pilots want, because let me tell you, if you guys want the skim gates to be
re-opened to us, there might be some work ahead of us."
Eli Grey nods. "Of course."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "So, the floor is open for some respectful
discussion, unless you have something you want to add, Miss Richard?"
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa sits down on an ergonomically designed silver
mesh chair.
"Not at this time. This is your meeting." Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard
smiles.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Delightful."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Anyone want to add anything?"
Constantine Stone says, "Well, I'll say one thing."
Constantine Stone says, "I know I've bellyached about not being able to rent a
platform or access Farport."
Constantine Stone says, "Those things are nice, but I don't necessarily thing
access to them is worth opening every can of worms."
Constantine Stone says, "Depending on how far we have to bend over backwards to
get access back."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "You aren't the only one who has. Which is
why I wanted to hold this meeting. To be honest, I don't know how far we might
have to bend backwards, though I might have an idea."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I do because it is the only
well-equipped Exploration starship that we can obtain."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'when configured of course."
Constantine Stone says, "I think we can make do if we need to make do, is all
I'm saying."
Eli Grey says, "Is simply trying to do a non-aggression pact with skim access
included out of the question? It sounds liek that's what they really want."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As most AEU pilots are dedicated
explorers."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Well, let me put this into perspective.
Mind you, this is jus tan example."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "What if the Mutuality wanted access to
the blueprints for a certain ship. Doesn't matter what ship, but any ship, as
long as they can have a hope of remaining on even footing in case of an attack."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "What then? From all of you?"
Constantine Stone says, "I don't like that, personally."
Eli grimaces.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods to Constantine Stone.
winse
I don't understand that.
winse
I don't understand that.
wince
You wince.
Lily looks hesitant and doubtful.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Your reactions pretty much mirror mine at
the very thought."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I'm not a fan of this idea either. Ships
are just an example. It could honestly be anything."
Constantine Stone nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
nod 'right
You nod. "Right."
Constantine Stone says, "But I think that's a logical expectation."
Constantine Stone says, "Or something like that. A piece of military tech,
maybe."
Constantine Stone says, "And this is what I'd consider too much."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Now, let's make it a slightly lesser
extreme. Access to the revo and the Telex Jackrabbit, which a lot of them would
definitely secretly love to have back."
Johnathon Triggs says, "Think i've said this before... might've been on our
trip. Weapons to other alliances, of our own, should be out of the question.
Defenses, on the other hand, is someting else."
Eli Grey asks, "Is that the kind of thing it took for the last skim treaty or
non-aggression pact?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well they sure have their eyes on our
battery."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Part of the skim treaty involved a
sharing of technologies."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pierre once told me so."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "The non-aggressio npact encouraged more
of the sharing of technologies, but there was some with the QSA access as well."
Eli Grey nods and grins. "Yeah, everyone loves the Revo."
nod
You nod.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Things like the farport upgrades, the
tactical platform, those were all aprt of the QSA treaty."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Otherwise I don't think there's... well I
know they'd love our Combat ships."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Things like the jackrabbit, the revo,
those were more a part of the non-aggression pact of the treaty."
Constantine Stone asks, "So when we had non-agression, they did have access to
those?"
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Right."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Just like the league and the fringe
presently do."
Constantine Stone nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And our battlesuit but they don't care much
forit."
Johnathon nods slowly, listening.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But they should."
Constantine Stone says, "Well, if they used to have access to those things, I
don't suppose there would be a big problem with offering it again."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sure they'd like our Constructor too."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "So honestly that's where we're at. My
belief is that we might have to do some sort of technology exchange; maybe revo,
or telex jackrabbit, or both for the QSA access and the sharing of technologies
like the Farport upgrades."
Eli Grey asks, "I'm guessing there's credits made thre too? They only had access
to sell those things, we were still producing them, correct?"
Ather says to Lily, "I very much doubt they care about the constructor."
'probably, butI don't think anyone else has acess to the constructor.
You say, "Probably, butI don't think anyone else has acess to the constructor."
'access
You say, "Access."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Right well that's true that's something
only alllied would get most likely."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh, you mean we'd have to give the Revo up for less
than a non-aggression pact with them."
Constantine Stone says, "That makes sense."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Constantine Stone.
Ather says to Eli, "Well, we wouldn't give it to them, we'd just allow their
pilots to purchase them, if the AEU government sanctioned the deal."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Which I'd be in favor of."
Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Constantine Stone says, "I guess I don't love the idea of giving them more for
less like that."
Constantine Stone says, "But it may be our only option."
Eli Grey says, "It also sounds like it will be a non-aggression pact without
being a non-aggression pact? That's the part I think I'm having trouble with."
Constantine Stone says, "No, this will just be for skim access."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "As you've noted, non-aggression pacts
tend to come with component sharing agreements by default. Not sharing the
blueprints, so to speak, but providing access to them for purchase."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "In all fairness, we've been obtaining more
from them for the past few years than they have from us other than having access
to the Skims."
Constantine says to Lily, "That's a good point."
nod antoin
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "So you all would be in favor of giving
them access to one, the other or both of these technologies for QSA access, and
access to the stuff we use to have with it? In addition to a Mutuallly-agreed
upon guarantee from both sides of no hostilities?"
You nod to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Constantine says to Ather, "I would be in favor of that."
nod ather
You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.
Ather nods slowly, rubbing his chin with a hand.
Constantine says to Ather, "Would you?"
'Maybe we should put it up for a vote on the voting machine?
You ask, "Maybe we should put it up for a vote on the voting machine?"
Constantine Stone nods.
Eli Grey says, "Wouldn't give us much to work with if we ever wanted to get an
actual Non-aggression pact later."
Ather says to Constantine, "I'm trying to get an idea of what the alliance
pilots want before attempting negotiations. My opinions don't matter at the
moment."
Constantine says to Eli, "That's also a good point."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or we could just agree here with all of us
who are assembled."
Constantine Stone says, "I think a formal vote couldn't hurt the process."
Ather says to Lily, "But we're not the only pilots in the corps."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I agree was just suggesting."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Therefore, a proposal is warrented, and
one will go up after the meeting. Good thought."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do believe a vote is more democratic."
Constantine Stone says, "Eli's point is a good one."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "What I am trying to say is that if you
plan to negotiate a non-aggression pact, component sharing is already assumed.
It cannot then also be exchanged for gate access. Unless you plan to negotiate
non-standard terms."
Constantine Stone says, "Right, but I think Ather is currently proposing only a
gate access agreement."
Constantine Stone says, "Unless I'm mistaken."
Ather says to Antoinette, "The Mutuality are a complicated entity. Based on the
reactions of the pilots here, it seems that negotiating with them should be
done, and we may have to negotiate non-standard terms."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes but I honestly belive a NAP with
Mutuality is very ver far away and regretfully so."
Ather says to Constantine, "I can see what we can get out of it, but likely we
will not get more than QSA access, if even that."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Very well."
Constantine Stone nods.
nod
You nod.
Lily nods slowly.
Constantine Stone says, "Unfortunately it may just take time to rebuild trust."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Basically, we're going to have to work
our way up, but that just goes back to how far you all want to bend over
backwards. I'll be perfectly frank."
Constantine Stone nods.
nod
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We're going very non-standard with this
suggestion."
You nod.
Constantine Stone says, "Maybe start with just one of the revo or jackrabbit."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We're in a unique position due to current
situations, and we're just going to have to play the cards we're dealt. It's
pretty much a pair of 5's right now. Not much better than that. We just have to
make sure that they don't have a set of cards higher than that one."
nod and nod
You nod and nod.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "During each meeting of the Council where I
have been present, they stress over and over again that we don't have much to
offer them. However this last meeting was certainly the concern that the AEU
would not act aggressively towards them and what would we do as polots to get
this through to our Government. And I agree ather."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pilots that is."
Ather opens his mouth to speak, shrugs, closes it and glances around for a
moment before speaking again.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa
thoughtfully.
Ather turns to the negotiators and asks, "was there anything that seemed to
specifically peek their interest?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just as I said, that We, the AEU would not
attack the Mutuality."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.
Ather says to Antoinette, "A question."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard asks, "Yes?"
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
'That was the amin concern.
You say, "That was the amin concern."
'main
You say, "Main."
Ather hesitates for a moment before asking, "let's say we negotiate a
hypothetical treaty with the Mutuality, and both sides agreed to the no
hostilities. As a token of good faith, since I don't expect an honorable
government such as ours to break their word, would the government possibly
sanction an addition that said that the AEU pilots would fight against our own
navy in the event that they did attack first? As I said, this would be a token
suggestion, which would likely never need to be put into effect."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "It does sound bad, it's true."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "But."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "If we stuck to our word, which I feel
confident we would do."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "It's no sacrifice on anyone's part."
Lily nods emphaticlaly.
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Under no circumstances would this
government, or, I imagine, any government, approve a treaty that sanctions
treason and... well, effectively, civil war."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I figured as much."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Bending that far backward would've made
any pilot uncomfortable, I'd imagine."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.
Constantine Stone nods.
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Eli nods solemnly.
Eli Grey takes a sip of a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.
nod
You nod.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Alright. Well, with regards to the
Mutuality thing, all that really remains, is to put up the proposal detailing
what we discussed in the negotiations. Unless someone else has anything to add,
I suppose we can press onward and forward."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Does anyone have anything else to add?"
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "In relation to the Mutuality?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.
Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Eli Grey says, "No, I suppose not."
headshake
You shake your head.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Alright. Well then, on to my next topic."
Ather gestures to a patriotically painted donations box.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Mis Richard, while we have you here, if
you please! We have been wanting to use this donation box for several things.
Including providing a relief fund for citizens who cannot afford the use of
medical creches, to a fund-raising effort for the victims of the 9/24 crashes."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "But, based on previous records, inquiries
about that have gone mostly unanswered."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "While well-intentioned, such efforts
might draw more attention to the role civilian pilots played in that attack."
Eli looks down at the floor.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Perhaps you're right, when it comes to
the latter attack, but what about the former thing, which is not really related
to civilian pilots?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Johnathon Triggs says, "That's not a bad idea..."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "It's a possibility, though I suspect
President Best will prefer that work to be done via an entity already in the
health care market rather than a fund that the government would control."
Johnathon Triggs says, "The medical creche, idea, that is."
Lily looks rather frustrated and curiously towards the Donations Box.
Constantine Stone says, "But just in general, would it be possible to get a
donations box that we're able to create funds for on the fly? Or are you saying
that this would be something that could be too easily misused."
Constantine Stone says, "Like I know we've collected donations for Hyperion in
the past."
Constantine Stone says, "And things like that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Honestly we's prefer that these funds are
targetted towards a worthy cause which we as pilots may contribute towards for
good will."
Eli Grey says, "Maybe a donation proposal has to be voted on before it starts
receiving donations."
Eli Grey shrugs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'we actually did while I was Voice of the
Corps and it passed."
Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I don't know when this donations box was
established but those funds have been just sitting there for what... years?"
Eli Grey says, "A long time yes, and the asteroid feild it was for turned out to
be in a bad spot. I believe soem of those funds have already been spent though."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Yes, to my knowledge, those funds have
long been disbursed."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh ok well then they do need to be put to
some good purpose."
Eli Grey nods. "It would be nice though, for us to have some way of contributing
donations to help the other citizens."
Eli Grey finishes off a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.
Johnathon Triggs asks, "How about funds for 'planetary defense research'? To
possiblely.. avoid any further catastrophic events?"
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Well, as I said, I think the only way
forward with health care donations would be to identify a... caretaker to
disburse the funds."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Constantine Stone asks, "Like perhaps if we donated to Garner care?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I believe they should go toward humanitary
aid."
Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Ather says to Lily, "The funds that are in the box already have already been
given out to the previous project which they were intended for."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "That's just a number to signify how much
was donated. The credits are not actually there any longer."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I have donated since I became a
pilot."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa approaches a patriotically painted donations
box.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps others have since."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Garnercare is a term applied to a
government program which subsidized the use of regenerative therapy. The
National Patriots believe this can be done more efficiently by those already
familiar with the health care market."
Constantine Stone says, "I see."
Lily says to Antoinette, "Yes I'm sure our family's medical services has but
just wanted to promote something for us as pilots to give towards.... Too bad."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "My family's that is."
Evangeline Adaire opens the door.
Evangeline Adaire glides in from the south.
nod eva
You nod to Evangeline Adaire.
Evangeline Adaire sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.
Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.
Ather says to Antoinette, "Thank you for clarifying. Well, we can get this
donation box removed so that no one can get the wrong idea in future and donate
to a survey expedition that has been long completed. However, it would be nice
if we could get a more customizeable donation box in the event that we might
find a lucritive venture to donate for. The fund centers prove a bit unreliable,
since we can't control who withdraws."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa closes the door.
Evangeline Adaire walks in quietly and doesn't say a word sitting down quietly
as she pushes a hand through her hair. She nods to those who nod to her, though
otherwise does nothing else.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Eli Grey nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Eli Grey says, "Yeah."
nod athe3r
I don't see that here.
nod ather
You nod to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As the funds I contributed are dormant."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Not that they were sizable."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Does anyone else have any topics they
want to bring up before we conclude this meeting?"
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Yes. As I say, you may still find a way
to contribute. Just understand that President Best is unlikely to approve of
expanding the government's role in the health care market."
Eli Grey says, "I'd like to ask something yes."
Ather says to Antoinette, "So noted."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.
Eli says to Ather, "Now that the outccord negotiations are finished, has there
been any word on what kind of changes we can expect to see in the corps?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So what's the role of charities then?"
Eli Grey says, "Everything still seems normal to me, that's the only reason I'm
asking."
Ather directs the question to Antoinette by saying, "Mis Richard?"
Ather says to Eli, "Well, it will take a month or two to finish up everything."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "But I am fairly sure someone said no more
geminis down the line."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I'm sure Mis Richard will clarify
further."
: frowns deeply.
Shule frowns deeply.
Eli Grey nods. "Yeah, it was said that was a possibility."
Evangeline frowns a little.
Johnathon frowns.
Ather directs his attention back to Antoinette.
Evangeline Adaire asks, "I actually like my gemini... Will our ships that we own
be taken from us, then?"
Constantine Stone says, "I doubt it. They're not rented, after all."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "You should expect to shift your wider
efforts of defending humanity from coordination by the Accord to a program
closer to home. That is all I can say at this time. Speaking practically, little
else is likely to change right away."
Eli Grey furrows his brow.
Eli Grey nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard. "Thank you."
: looks pensive.
Shule looks pensive.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well this is very unfortunate too because
of possible encounters with a certain Ifs category."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "Your existing geminis are already paid
for and fully owned by yourself and your government."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa nods.
Evangeline shrugs her shoulders, leaning back in her seat.
Johnathon Triggs asks, "Will there be something else for us, as AEU, to replace
the lose of Geminis?"
Ather says to Antoinette, "My cruiser is presently on loan to the Accord for an
operation. What's to become of that?"
nod
You nod.
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "To answer the other question, charities
are private organizations subject to specific regulations. They are not run by
the government either."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "That's actually very good to know."
Antoinette says to Ather, "That's a good question. I'll have to look into that,
but I assume the government will expect to have those ships released back to
you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm aware but they often assist with
certain humnitarian aid."
Constantine says to Lily, "I think what she's saying is that pilot-driven
donation funds are government funds, and the government doesn't want to be
involved in this issue."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "You are welcome to find a charity that
will work with you."
Ather says to Antoinette, "Is it possible for the Accord to retain use of that
cruiser until the conclusion of the operation?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That's a good idea actually."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "It's a possibility, though I'm not sure
how much either side will want to retain that sort of tie."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Well, if my word counts, I would like
that to be the case."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Until the conclusion of the operation."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "I will pass along your wishes, but I
can't make any promises."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Fair enough."
Johnathon frowns for a moment in thought.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Anyone else with anything?"
Constantine Stone says, "I had two things."
Lily slowly shakes her head.
Eli Grey looks at Constantine Stone thoughtfully.
Constantine says to Antoinette, "Ms. Richard, we previously discussed the
releasing of reports about the exact total physical damages caused in the
crashes."
Constantine Stone asks, "Have the reports been compiled yet, and if so, can they
be released to us?"
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "I'll deliver those reports when they're
ready for release."
Constantine Stone nods.
Constantine Stone says, "Thank you."
Constantine Stone says, "And secondly..."
Constantine sighs and looks down at his hands, drumming his fingers quietly on
the table.
Constantine Stone says, "I've had disagreements with the government."
Constantine Stone says, "Explosive ones."
Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.
Constantine Stone says, "And if I can prevent anyone from making the same
mistakes I have, I want to."
Constantine Stone says, "The Hyperion separatists have legitimate concerns,
surely."
Constantine Stone says, "But their way isn't the way."
Constantine Stone asks, "Is there anything we can do?"
Constantine looks around the table. "I mean to ask this of all of us, do we have
any ideas?"
Constantine says to Antoinette, "And maybe more specifically, do you know if the
patrols are accomplishing anything besides intimidating the populace?"
Eli shakes his head sadly.
Constantine Stone asks, "Has any actionable intelligence been gleaned from
them?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wish I did except that I don't believe in
violence towards anyone even if we so opposed to their point of view."
Constantine Stone nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "And I'm not advocating
violence against them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I also am not in favor of our patrolling
the streets as it is too intimmidating of innocent citizens and this, absolutely
is not what battlesuits are intended for."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "I'm not privy to military intelligence,
but I know that those patrols are meant to help keep the peace."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But we are not Law Enforcement."
Johnathon Triggs removes a gleaming set of handcuffs from a small cloth sack.
Eli Grey blinks.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances at Johnathon Triggs.
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "You're also not navy, not miners, and
not merchants, but you fill many roles when called upon, as defined in the
contract you signed when you joined the civilian corps."
Johnathon Triggs nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard.
Constantine Stone says, "I think what Johnathon means to indicate is that we can
and do enforce laws."
Lily looks at the door.
Lily eyes flash in anger.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Mis Richards just basically said what I was about to
say."
Johnathon Triggs grins.
Johnathon Triggs puts a gleaming set of handcuffs in a small cloth sack.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps within reason but intimmidating
citizens is not ethical."
Johnathon says to Lily, "Battlesuits are for our own protection.."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we're called upon to aide with specific
incidents, then yes but patroling streets is..."
Johnathon says to Lily, "It's a deterant."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident frowns at Johnathon Triggs.
Ather raises a hand.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We can debate this all night."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "We all have our viewpoints."
Johnathon says to Lily, "I know. I'm being the devils advocate. But, I'm trying
to see the other side of it."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "I choose not to do those patrols."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Whether you do or not is up to you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Same here."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "And that's the end of that."
Evangeline Adaire says, "I choose not to do them either."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa asks, "Anything else?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I also do not support them through the GSL
office."
Constantine Stone says, "That was all I had, at any rate."
Constantine Stone says, "Thank you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They ca deal with the naval representative.
"
Eli Grey puts a mug in a shiny green trash bin.
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Alright."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "Then I'd wager this meeting is concluded.
Look for proposals in the coming day or two."
Ather says to Antoinette, "Thank you for coming."

Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard says, "However you feel personally about going

activities."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa.
Ather says to Lily, "She is right."
Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa says, "You do have to maintain objectivity."
Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard nods.
Eli Grey nods to Pilot Liaison Antoinette Richard. "It was good to see you
again, ma'am."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I ahsll to the extent necessary but I don't

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I had one
question, that was left standing on the table. If we loose the use of attain
futher geminis. What will we as AEU for do for vehicals that are able to be rift
capable, and carry battlesuits?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think in the
near future we likely will not have alternative, but we'll just have to see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Ather Jammoa transmits,
"She likely left that one unanswered, because she has no solution to it yet. Or
a tleast, none that the government has communicated to her."

mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's what I
wondered. But it is something to be placed on the table."

the ones we already have being bought and paid for, I thought that was maybe to
say we'll make due."

manage. We have a bunch floating around."

idea."

those bastards arrested him too in his sleep for the stars sake!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wow, I guess that's
why they cleared out his robot from the mail room."
tra 1 Yeah, can we not tell everyone else from the other alliance about who it
was?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,

that robot belonged in there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
would appreciate it as I have never done that nor will likely. We all have our
absent-minded moments you know?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am glorious
philanthropist of discreteness."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I think some of
them already know, from what i've heard."

would they as neither of us have shared."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "This
is the absolute first time this has been shared."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well Ather
already knew."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No idea. I know
Morris was speaking about it not to long ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But
he didn't know what the circumstances were."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "At
any rate I was held for 6 hours and I guess Shule had a couple of hours to
serve. I don't know precisely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Surprised there
wasn't any tabloids on it."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hardly, it would be more the case in the
Fringe, if anything."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, I'm not actually sure how much
control the Fringe government has over the news sources, but in the League and
the AEU it's much like the United States or other "free" countries in our
current world. News is corporate. They get the story out, no matter what the
government thinks."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "There are ways that Fringe news can get
out too, but, the Fringe government is often the one that puts this kind of news
out anyway, we need to know a certain amount about military things in
particular."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Even if the fringe was as sensored as
north Korea, which I majorly doubt, they'd still report on things that made them
look good. Bringing down a massive outsider mothership makes them look good."

was in some odd survivalist group or something with no access to news, this
stuff would be known to them. But fear not! We know new players (cadets) don't
know these things, so it's something we generally gloss over."

could find the things that your char should already know for the future."
[Newbie Help] Thalia Wishheart transmits, "Of course thank you."

Pick up a mule in a fighter?"

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

loss of the skims was because we had no diplomatic relations to begin with, I
suppose I will go along with this but it just feels like we should be trying for

really want."

we're apparently consdiering offering up the revo and the jackrabbit, but since
what they really want is just a garunteee that we won't attack, couldn't we
offer the revo and jackrrabbit in exchange for a non-aggression pact instead?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I mean if we are offering
a non-agression part of a skim-access deal, they'll never even have an incentive

been trying since I became a pilot and failed for one reason or another."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My understanding
is that a non-aggression pact would give them the revo and jackrabbit anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that wrong?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, precisely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's kind of my point."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you guys
think trading them the revo and the jackrabbit will make them trust us more?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's not that I'm worried
about them having those components, more that we will be screwing ourselves out
of ever acheiving a non-aggression pact. As they will have the components and
the agreement of not attacking already in their skim treaty."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think we need
to rebuild trust, but I'm not sure trading those pieces of tech away is going to
accomplish that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It sort of seems
like we're trading them away for the convenience of having farport access."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's a gesture of

pilot who is still at large had more to do with it than most. But it was an AEU
run trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What.. exactly
happened?"
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its
many tendrils.
A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a small plastic statue of a Jinu.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
received 285,750.44 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating
Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My understanding
is that the crew got stuck somewhere on Feng Wo or something and had to raise
money to pay a fine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And did this by
trading in slaves, or something like that."
A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Who were
responsible?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know,
this was way before my time. I only heard this third or fourth hand."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know any
names."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd be surprised
if any of them are still pilots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, me too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They weren't even stuck,
they just would have had to leave without their robots, as they'd been
confiscated. The pilots except for the League pilot, are all in prison."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can watch the whole
trial on the Holo Johnathon, though it's in 3 parts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How did he avoid
going to prison?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Was he just
never apprehended?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, Feldmen is stil at
large."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So what's
interesting from where I'm sitting is that the League never brought its
responsible pilot to justice, and they have an alliance with the Mutuality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I want to say not
hard. Space is very vast.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We've locked
ours up for life, and we have nothing with them. This can't be the source of the
friction between us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The League pilots though,
actually ent an obtained evidence of the thing, and also managed to free two of
the slaves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I see."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from

A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a
plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't
break the toy.
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting
close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That was just the
catalyst though. AEU Mutuality relations have never been top notch, due to other
things in the past."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Then the um.. other thing
happened while I was gone, with someone threatening to draw outsiders to
Mutuality space. I believe they intitiated relations again after that just to
revoke them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... that's
what I thought cased it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's a trust issue
really. The way the slaver pilots hid what they did so well, made the government
unable to act, and when they finally did it just seemed like they were covering
it up or something at first. That's not the case at all, the pilots were
prosecuted fully. But you know things are sometimes when we're talking about the
way things are,  and the way they seem."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "It wouldn't have gone that way if I could
have just gotten those ladies to act." Eli Grey sighs. "They genuinely wanted to
do something but they were kinda frozen by fear. At least that's all I could
come up with, I told them several times to do something, anything at all to try
and fix it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What ladies?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nadira at least made a
public statement denouncing slavery, that was something. It wasn't enough in the
end but at least it was something other than just hiding in a ship and crying
their eyes out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The ones involved in the
slaver thing, at least two of them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "One of them was my fucking
girlfriend."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "How did they get
found out in trading slaves?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, which
one?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nadira?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, Kesi."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn. She's in
prison now?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they all are.
Probably for the rest of their lives gauging by how many years they have on
their sentences."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well Johnathon, the folks
at Andy's informed ryland about it. He ended up showing up over new Earth
shooting at ATher, because all he knew was that it was an invaders carrier that
it happened on at the time. He assumed that Ather knew about it and was shooting
at him and calling him a son of a bitch and stuff. It was all pretty intense."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises
its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while
dancing around it.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So is slavery
illegal in all tandem pact space?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am sure that
didn't go overly well.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What happened?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Several other things were
traded, they were trying to get enough of the currency to get their robots back.
At one point some slaves got offered and anotehr trader was looking for slaves,
so they basically took a shortcut. Sadly, this is I believe the first instance
of anyone actually trading at Andy's in this fashion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Next, that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is slave trading
legal at Andy's?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sounds a bit of a
set up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, they were
unsanctioned trades, though the pilots at the time did'nt know that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I'm
somewhat surprised they got life in prison for breaking Union laws far outside
Union space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if they
broke tandem pact laws too, I guess that explains it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And I think that their
not exactly illegal? But they would be under sanctioned trades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well they also traded a
league Corvette at the start of the trades, to get it all going. That counts as
arming an unregistered entity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "We're AEU pilots.
Not rogue pilots or unreg pilots.. we have standards."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think they all got liek
ten years apiece, just for that one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We do, but does
that mean I can go to prison for using a targeting computer bypass when I'm out
of comms range?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Did they check
common sense at the door or something?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Then I believe it was
thirty years apiece for each count of slave trading, so they're all in there in
a long time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think constantine,
because you would still be using it in a Union ship while you are acting in a
official capacity as a Union pilot. I could be wrong on that oe though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Think about it like this,
If I fly out of comms range and then stab someone, I don't get away scott free
just because I wasn't in anyone's space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I was
thinking stabbing someone was legal where you went."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if slavery
is illegal at Andy's, then that explains it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey laughs. "No, never go to the stabby
zone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Stabby zone is
outsider space, right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well ti's weird, because
from what I understand, it's not exactly illegal either, or else they wouldn't
have been openly doing it right there on the trading floor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I
find curious about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But, at the end
of the day, don't enslave people."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So it really
shouldn't be a problem."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the legality of it
hardly matters, it's the ethical part that's the real reason not to be doing
it."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a
plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when
it can't break the toy.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It does matter a
bit for their sentencing, which is why I was curious about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I really wish they could
have gotten the girl back, the video clips don't paint a very pretty picture of
where she was going."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And Feldmen was making a
big joke out of it, fucking scumbag."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like in the clip he says
somethingl ike "got one girl here, she's naked and chained up real good" or
something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Were the victims
in question from Demargas? Why did Ryland take this one trade, out of what I
assume are many that occur frequently out in Tandem space, so personally?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Moron."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils
and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And from what I was told,
the guy was like groping her and stuff liek she was a piece of meat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Was Feldman ever
seen again?"
Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No they weren't from
Demargas, they took it personally because they expect that kinda thing out of
certain unreg clans and such, but not out of alliance pilots that are supposed
to be friends."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I'm
fuzzy on the relations at play here. If it's commonplace at Andy's, is it not
their own people doing it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Andy's isn't Mutuality,
it's part of the Feng wo trading collective."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Their own people
being tandem pact members."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that's
separate from the tandem pact?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, it is it's own
thing. I don't believe they are part of the Tandem Pact."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Though I think they do
have some sort of diplomatic relations witht he Mutuality, not sure how far that
goes though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Further than
ours, I'd wager."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Seems you can do
anything except whatever it is we do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And be on okay
terms with them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "At the time that it
happened, no. We still had a non-aggression pact."
Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo jumps into your lap and settles in,
purring.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, did Ather
send Ryland home in a pod?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was hoping
so.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No no, that would have
just escalted things even further. He simply kept evading and trying to find out
what was goign on."
Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo curls up and closes its eyes.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "None of us knew about the
salve thing. Not even me, and I was on board the ship sleeping when it happened.
I had been sick for most of the trip. I even came out and checked out the
station a few hours afterwards and had no idea. I just walked around and checked
things out then went back to sleep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There was a note that was
left for me, about not brining my robots on board so they wouldn't be
confiscated, and something about a fighter that had been let unlocked and gotten
stolen, but tha'ts it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I know that Kesi
believed, that since it was a League corvette that had been traded and since
Feldmen did the trades himself, that it was going to be a League issue. But
since it was her trip,  and since she had to undock the fighter for him it made
her just as responsible."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And since they had
authorized him to trade on their behalf."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The whoel thing was just
stupid. They were just robots, they could have left them there and built new
ones, or even just stayed a bit longer and got the currency without trading
slaves. There was no reason why it all had to be done in that instant."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its
claws together.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if this
happened today everyone on the trip would have been thrown in jail for touching
an unreg."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Johnathon, when you have
time I highly recommend that you watch the trial. It's not an easy thing to
watch but it's something that I think pilots should watch to sorta educated
themselves on what not to do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not saying that you need
to be told not to trade slaves, just more that it helps to see the real
consequences of someone's actions. Alwyas use your head."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws creeps
across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I generally tend
to use common sense when it comes to trading. Trade of Human life is just
unthinkable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd like to get
out to Feng Wo."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many
tendrils.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And beyond."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah me too, I've only
ever been to Andy's and tom Town of Two Words."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It sounds like
Andy's can be reached in a carrier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Feng Wo
sounds too far, even from Andy's."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, you could make it to
Feng wo in a carrier, just probably need a furnace on it though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Luckily they have repair
stuff there, so you could get the furnace repaired."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a
plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when
it can't break the toy.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have they eased
up on your point limits at all yet, John?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah. Finally."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, great!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, when they
did.. I had almost mit my max again with space combat and ground combat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Need to take some
time to work on industry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I could
really use some scratch. I'm probably close to calling it a day, work wise, but
if you want we can haul rocks tomorrow."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've
almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Heh, sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And with the
relaxed caps I think there's probably a reactionless jet in your future, so we
can go artifacting some time as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's what i'm
gaming for."
A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its
tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest
and jets off.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "On top of that,
I'm hoping to grab a Gem before they become 'unavailable'."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You should be
able to do that, it has pretty light requirements."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps
its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

point do you get promoted, from a shuttle to something larger?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "You wonder that
too?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather once told

point, you mean?"

good?"

ten. I am not sure where to check if I am yet eligable for a promotion."

okay. I make about 6 in 20 minutes, I think."

pretty decent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's a lot of
deliveries."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't hauled
in a while but I think hauling is better for points."

should get much better as you get promoted, for money at least."

eligable for a promotion with couriers?"

pain!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Do creds that we
earn, at pilot owned temp salvage stations get taxed after the transfer..
process.. is complete. Or.. is there deduction of some sort with it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll come find
you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where are you
currently?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say
all taxes are taken out before we're paid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was just
wondering, because last time.. I had over a mil credited at the station,
transfered the salvage, and I think I got less that what was credited. Unless,
that was just because of a difference in currency."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it was
likely that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Our taxes are
like 90%, so any difference related to taxes being taken out would be incredibly
dramatic."

Justin."

made or found??"

me..."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To make a faster
airlock pump for that asteroid hauler."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're good to
have on artifacting and asteroid hauling ships, basically anything you use the
airlock often on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was justing
thinking that...."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Just..
thinking.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What do you need
for parts to make those?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let me see."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Medium metal
frame, handful of bolts, two circuit boards, two dozen pistons, and thirty-two
cylinders."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The pistons I'll
have to find... and the cylinders."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Definately need
to do more nests."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Will be adding
that on my 'need to get lists.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, the parts
aren't super rare or anything. If you need one once you start getting other
ships, I can make you one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ok!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I forsee a need
for one in the future..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If not two..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is there a beacon
locater device? Oh... never mind. Can't add that to courier vessels."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Wait, there's a plan?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not really."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well..."

really."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What happened?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, like a
dummy, I didn't realize that there were no inserters pointing back from 287."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh damn, I'm sorry. I
probably should have known that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, no worries.
Now we know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How did you even get in
touch with anyone?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nope."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, no, cause
there's not even an inserter going from 287 ro 288."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To, rather."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. need a
rift drive to get out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well shit, sorry man."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It was no big
deal. At least we weren't stuck anywhere dangerous."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Either of you
want to git a Nest or.. someting?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Reminder to all
pilots. A proposal of importance is up on the AEU voting machine. Vote on it,
tell your AEU friends to vote on it too. It could determine a lot!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So close.. I can
taste it!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs assaults your ears with a
burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs,
"WOO! 200!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Now... where was
that spacejet.. Torus?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sweeeeeetness."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey, constantine.
It's 3000 industry OR 300 exploration."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was thinking it
was AND."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh no. Like I
was saying earlier, I got the industry first."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Because that was
easier for me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's a
relief.... sort of."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Do have to say
though... a fair good price for it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rift drive?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, they're
costly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Half a bil."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The improved
anchor is 250 industry.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, not too
bad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The fast engines
are a serious boon, though. Last time I hauled I didn't even have the EAOS
reactionless mark 2, and it was so much faster today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Fast engines are
a boon to everything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Fast engines,
good battery."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's all is
needed for exploration, on a ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh... and
autovector."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For artifacting
at least. I don't know how often those get used for other exploration."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Besides the
battery, obviously."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Which?
Autovector?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, does that
get used on expeditions much?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I
assumed expeditions were just rifting 90% of the time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No idea.
Possiblely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It can for artifacting,
but no, not really."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Still useful to have, of
course."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I think people
used autovector to gather artifacts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, and a
pittance in cost compared to the other stuff you're likely to bring."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They did, but that
doesn't always happen on expiditions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you're trying to hit a
goal for example, you don't want to spend too much time doing anything else
before you get there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's still something good
to have if you need it, but for the actual just exploring part, you mostly just
need rift drive and some good sensors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And cahrge, lots of
charge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Scouts could be
rented, right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Having said that, I would
still be pretty surprised to see an exploration ship without it heh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think they rent one at
Tannhauser?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think it's for combat
though, not really exploring."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's' what I
was wondering."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Just calls it a
deep space scout."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm I don't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hmm?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "About the rrental scout."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's 3.89 mil to
rent.. for an hour. Not sure i'd use it for exploration..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't want to
be a bother... but do either of you want to go looking for local artifacts?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't
currently. I'm probably not going to be doing much for the next 12 hours or so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Besides
resting."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not sure, but
there are mileage and mileage reset buttons on your console you can use to keep
rough track of how far you've gone."
tra 1 I think 20 sectors, but you should use your mileage meter.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"I think 20 sectors, but you should use your mileage meter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's also a
really handy beacon autostop unit you should look into. Start your search by
going down one, then in any direction, and when you're ready to go home just go
up and return in the opposite direction."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And you'll stop
when you get back to the beacon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Unfortunately...
right now it's too late to reset it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any
point in minicannons on a pulsar?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess you

there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
only used torp launchers when I was pretty new at piloting becaus the lasers
were a little on the low side The Eaos torpedo Launcher is very nice though. We
may not be able to get those later on though."
tra 1 HAving been stuck on a cruiser that ran out of ammo twice on a high

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I should've went

about 777 is that if you have a rift drive the direction you fly in doesn't
matter."

unless they have totally changed it to some other Ftingy name."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor;
Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow

windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

Jade Burkley
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has creamy skin. Her body is athletic with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely
calves. She has narrow shoulders and a small bust. Her face is heart-shaped,
lightly-freckled, and quite pretty, with an average nose and cleft chin. Her
lips are soft and applied with shiny red lipstick, and occasionally part to
reveal a set of shiny white teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are
green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is medium golden brown
and drawn back in a ponytail. She has neatly trimmed light pink fingernails.
A sparkling sapphire stud pierces her left earlobe and a sparkling sapphire stud
pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a white AEU t-shirt, a pair of white AEU sweatpants, and a pair
of black suede loafers. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader,
a portable newsfeed aggregator, a gaudy metachannel FTL communicator, a standard
starship flightbag, a message board reader, an alliance information assistant, a
purple velvet backpack decorated with abstractly patterned pink studs, and a
flight control scanner. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both
forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

ftl battle of mir
Cadet Katie Celayla sashays south.
The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its
existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased
destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris
still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.
A beacon marks the site of the failed attempt to hold back an Outsider task
force on its way to Mir at the start of the Outsider War. Nearby space glitters
with the wreckage of starships and other debris.
Via general sector communication, Beacon M-534 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Lidia's Pride.' Welcome to Battle of Mir."

Star Conquest Help: Aerial Fortress and Deployment Station
--
Category: Ground Combat
--
An aerial fortress and deployment station (known more simply as an aerial
fortress, or 'airfort') is a base of operations for a group of battlesuits.
Aerial fortresses must also have a ship capable of transporting to the fortress
to a mission area.
You can purchase an aerial fortress at any capital planet. The ship which can
transport a fortress is classes as a "mule," and must be found elsewhere.
EQUIPPING AN AERIAL FORTRESS
First of all, you do not need your own aerial fortress, particularly if you're
just starting out. There are probably a handful of aerial fortresses already
owned by people in your alliance, and early on you will just be joining other
pilots on one of these.
When or if the time does come to purchase your own aerial fortress, you can do
so at the same facility where you purchased your battlesuit. You must already
own a fortress-transporting ship in order to purchase a fortress.
There are some things you must buy in order to prepare your aerial fortress for
combat.
* Synthesis supplies: An aerial fortress will synthesize all battlesuit
ammunition from this as needed, so make sure you have plenty on board.
* Ammunition: Your fortress will often have to fight off defenders as it
approaches a mission site. Its weapons require ammunition.
* Vehicles: If you're going to be performing more dangerous missions, you will
often want surface assault vehicles and fliers on your fortress. Don't forget
the ammunition that goes with them.
* Other supplies: Other items, like demolition charges, are quite good to have
on board.
One thing you do not have to supply are battlesuits. Pilots will all bring their
own when they board your aerial fortress.
DESCENDING TO A MISSION AREA
Once you have found a planet, space station, or other structure that can be
attacked, you must move an aerial fortress to it with the help of a
fortress-transporting ship (for instance, the Masterson Mule transport).
Once there, move into the aerial fortress's control room and type DESCEND.
At many locations, your fortress will be attacked as it descends! Fortunately,
it has a starboard and port turret that can fend off attackers.
Weapons at each turret are:
* Lasers: For firing on targets alongside the fortress.
* Missile rear/forward: For firing on targets ahead of or behind the fortress.
* Grapeshot rear/forward: More of a passive defense that your target may fly
into as it moves.
You must fight off your attackers by successfully keeping track of their
position and firing weapons as appropriate from the correct turret.
As the aerial fortress takes damage, someone aboard should go into its
engineering room and type REPAIR. Repairs will be ongoing as long as this room
remains manned.
ARRIVING AT A MISSION AREA
Once you are at a mission area, the first thing you will probably want to do is
type REMOTE. This will send your airfort transport off to an adjacent sector
where it is hopefully less likely to be disturbed.
Next, type SCAN. Your fortress's computer will analyze the situation provide you
with one or more missions. On planets, your fortress will take time to move to
the next mission.
FINISHING A MISSION
Once all battlesuits have launched and are back aboard, someone should type
CLEAR to return them to storage. The fortress will also set about repairing
them.
ONTO THE NEXT MISSION
Often the attack is over with the completion of a single mission. Operations on
planets, however, are often much more complex. Return to the fortress control
room and type SCAN once again to pick another mission.
LEAVING THE MISSION AREA
Once operations have concluded or you're done for the day, type REMOTE again to
call back your fortress's transport. Once it has arrived, type ASCEND to return
your fortress to the transport.

You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment

The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

should've seen the Nest we'd finished. It was a moderate Nest. We ran into a...
problem. A SHREW AND a ORK... together, as a combo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You've totally gotta let
me call you JJ."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Stone Popped..
and shule, katie and myself nearly did too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sounds pretty rough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... we
questioned weather to bail or not. I was like.. no way. We can do this. And, we
did it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That combo was
probably the worse thing in that entire Nest."

the womb?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Angry orc?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's really
powerful."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's ridiculously useful
in that situation, yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "On a combo like
that... yeah.. it's definately needed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Until someone accidently
throws a det or uses somethign with splash damage heh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "When you see them throw
the det, it all happens in slow motion.. You see it flying towards the knocked
out foe and all you can do is say "Nooooooo!" in slow motion."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The mother replicator is
insane with crazy defenses and a big, big laser."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Lots of combos
like that? Or with Mice?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that like the
womb?"

replicators to help."

interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "...like a
challenge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah,  a challenge is one
word for it. They can be done for sure, but they take a little planning."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "For sure!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So, compared to a
dangerous Nest.. what's the Mother Nest like?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A park walk?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I wouldn't say a park
walk, no."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Id' say the rest of the
nest is probably about the same as a dangerous, but it's that fight with mother
that will really get you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's also been a long
time since I've done one, so things might have changed. But I can only imagine
that they've changed for the worst."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, me too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ok time for a a bit more
sleep before I get to work, later folks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Night Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Huh? A minimodule
for explosion resistance.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon sarcastically remarks, "Is that a
minimodule to resist exploding?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "We.. well.. after
remarking that, that would be part of it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's probably
useful against grenades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. I was just
thinking that. How the timing was sooooo off."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Would've been
nice to have it on that Nest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my
league suit actually has one of those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just because I
picked it up and never replaced it with anything better."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "This is a
lesser.. so.. might not be that great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Never know,
though. Going to keep it for the next nest we do... that gets a little
complcated."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Swap it out with
the Laser Resistance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Minimodule of
greater syrup."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Gah.. can you
imagine that suit on a Mother nest?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Woo. 201 ground."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs cheers.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yep! Laser
rifle!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I wonder what I
get for chainguns..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm.... lasers..
or chains... had choice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never used
a suit with chains."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't like the
idea of buying ammo... But.. it's not bad in most cases. Expect for Bari."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lasers aren't
really great against bari either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But at least you
won't run out of ammo, true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But... but.. if
you see the damage output on this repeating rifle.. man.. oh, man... I'm
drooling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, ".... wow.... this
makes short work of drones in a hurry..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Though, the fire
time between shots.. and that of a laser, doesn't make all too a differance.. in
the end."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Think... I'll
definately stick with lasers. But, it's fun to trash drones with these
chainguns."
[MTTS] usfolks: Sorry to repeat the traceback. I thought I mistyped it. No clue
why that would traceback...
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Was Frontier
Processor ever purged, yet?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's a
reasoable alloted time to explore for artifacts, Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "With auto-vector?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You may be asking the
wrong person, because I just tend to do it and do it unti li have some other
reason to stop."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So my answer would be, um
hours."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ahh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I guess I am
mainly looking for a minimum time frame."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you aren't having any
luck, try changing your direction, or even just moving up or down a few sectors
and head back the other way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I tend ot travel in a
downard spiral. I make a full circuit, changing after each artifact, then drop
down one and start it over."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But that's just me, I
think a lot of olks just head straight. Also it can get confusing to get back
that way unless you are near an auto-travel destination."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't think
I'll be doing much local artifact gathering till I can get autovector... unless
I go with someone else. Doing the way I was doing it, was very tedious."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And painful."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I mean doing it
without auto-vector is doable, but having it is almost a must for efficient
artifacting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I traveled close
to 60 sectors without autovector... and only found artifact. Took me three
hours. I was pained."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Erm.. only found
1 artifact."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an
insulated purple sleeping bag here.

Shule,
This letter is to let you know that there are starving felo on Effervescent
Zephyr.
I've seen you going in and feeding them, so I'm writing to you.
If you're tired of doing it which I wouldn't blame you for, send me the key so
that I can take them to the sanctuary, and she can just get more if anyone will
give them to her.
This is not how felo should be treated.
If you do want to continue caring for them, please come and fix this as soon as
possible.
Thank you,

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad.

She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has freckled skin. Her body is a bit thinner than average with attractively
curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has angular shoulders and slightly
smaller than average breasts. Her abdomen is firm and punctuated by a small
navel. Her face is heart-shaped, lightly-freckled, and subtly asymmetrical, with
a delicate nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rosy and
occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, her eyes are blue-grey and narrow. Her shoulder-length, wavy hair is
coppery red and swept back from her face into a mass of tousled curls. She has
long clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a vividly painted red and gold dragon mask with gleaming white
teeth and curved golden horns, a short dark red cotton tee with a glittery
shooting star printed on the front, a tasteful silver watch with diamond
accents, a silver link chain with a red jasper rose suspended from it around her
waist, a pair of faded red low rise cut-offs, and a pair of cross-strapped light
brown leather sandals. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a
light metallic gray flightbag with a multicolored spiral galaxy on the side, a
tyrian purple swivel einrophone in a golden brown reinforced plastic phone
holster, a compact metallic royal purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys
embossed on the front with a glittery royal purple camera strap, a metachannel
FTL communicator, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a black velvet backpack, a
black silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered red dragons, a silver
link bracelet decorated with small black and red jasper roses, and a bright
orange 'FENG WO' canvas shopping bag. Her head, both eyes, neck, both elbows,

[Starship "Israel Hope"; Shower]
This is a very tiny shower. There is no shower head as such, but instead a small
sprayer attached to a hose coming out of the wall, which would work to some
effect even in zero gravity. A thick plastic sheet allows the shower to be
completely sealed off from the outside, with air pumped in overhead and several
grates capturing water to be returned to the ship's recycling system. The status
lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go out.

[The Torus; Garage]
The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the
day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray
metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary
lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who
come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the
structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

The path ends here in a clearing in the tall grass. The clearing is only twenty
feet wide, as though whoever made it wanted to have as little impact on the
environment as possible. On the east side of it is a squarish white building,
its plain facade decorated with a painted arch formed of the colorful
silhouettes of small cat-like creatures. In the center of the wall is a small
door with a large sign that you can LOOK at beside it and a bright red box
marked 'Donations!' beneath it. Extending from the building into the grass on
either side is a very high square-link fence which leaves narrow open spaces on
either side where the interior of the compound is visible.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "7? Maybe 8?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just got the
medium."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you want one of
invaders glorious max velocity increase and storage increase plants for a bit
more storage and slightly faster engine, the cost is only 150 million EAOS
credits! It is grand investment which will surely pay for itself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It'll be on my
list of things to get, in the future."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, you have a very
very very long way to go. I don't recommend people use such a plant without a
medium transport or better ship for couriering."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause you're going to
have that ship for a while, see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you can put
plants on courier ships?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep."

would they stop you."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why do you think I
just said what I just said about the plant I advertised?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assumed you
were talking about for ships in general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "A beacon amp helps too,
for those Tandem deliveries."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "...no, man. A storage
increase and max velocity increase plant is worthless on any other ship."

what I thought, too..."

was thinking."

smoking?"

I'm obviously never buying that plant."

hopeless."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't know?

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Best solution for
curing hopelessness: lay off the haze until you can handle its effects."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I made that plant
just for me and my couriering, but I suppose I wouldn't mind selling other
cuttings. It's honestly served me very well."

sorry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone coughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My thinking is
that the full non-aggression pact will tick all the boxes. It gets us the tech
we want, gives them more than the low-level tech they were getting in the old
skim agreement, and includes a promise of no hostility. If our government won't
make such a promise, striking a lesser deal with them could be dangerous and
blow up in our faces. If our navy were to use the skim to do something over
there, we'd never live it down."

eager!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I seen another
glowing vial... of blue stuff. Interesting stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh that. Yeah, don't
drink it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It made Eli into what
he is today, it made another guy into something frekay as fuck, it made a chick

pilot for this long, and seen some of the shit we've seen, you'd wonder how I'm
still actually technically still on the side of sane."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it can do a lot of
freaky stuff to people, and each vial isn't even necessarily the same stuff as
the last."

experimentation determined that much."

wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that

Star Conquest Help: Renaming Starships
--
Category: Game Systems
--
You may rename your starship at any branch of the Starship Registry, found at
all capital spaceport facilities. Renaming will charge you a fee depending on
the class and base value of the starship.
To rename your ship, have it on the nearest landing pad and use the RENAME
command inside a starship registry.
Renaming a ship will automatically post a public message to the message boards,
so that you cannot, for instance, commit an act of piracy and then make your

Star Conquest Help: Renaming Starships
--
Category: Game Systems
--
You may rename your starship at any branch of the Starship Registry, found at
all capital spaceport facilities. Renaming will charge you a fee depending on
the class and base value of the starship.
To rename your ship, have it on the nearest landing pad and use the RENAME
command inside a starship registry.
Renaming a ship will automatically post a public message to the message boards,
so that you cannot, for instance, commit an act of piracy and then make your
ship untraceable by changing its name.
If you are looking for help on renaming your character, please read the Name
Change help file.

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.
A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Hi everyone. Here is our state of the corps
report since the beginning of the term: we've completed 16 out of 88 decoy
beacon drops, and only destroyed 4 of 40 destroyed RATS nests. Lastly, we've
only hauled a total of 130 out of 1101 asteroids. There have been no salvage ops
run so far, and there haven't been any exploration trips done lately, so no
planets discovered and no salvage ops done. [21:19 20 October 2317 GST]

Hi Melinda, Morris has still not obtained parts. I checked the log and there are
two entries where i granted Morris Read/Withdrawal/Deposit rights on SEAS
warehouse. The first occurred on 9/29/2317 and I applied standard access again
on October 11th, 2317. I have also added others who I had previously deleted
such as Evenia and she has been withdrawing modules. Sorry to say it but if
Morris truly wanted us to participate, we could have made arrangements to get
these modules to him. We're doing the best we can to act in good faith here and
to comply with our agreement to cooperate with Morris. Thanks for looking into
this. - Lily

[Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Deployment]
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
Constantine Stone walks in from the north.
Constantine Stone presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an
EAOS Plasma Specialist from storage and sets it in front of him.
An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the
battlesuit's weapons.
Constantine Stone presses a button on an EAOS Plasma Specialist, which splits
open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.
Jonathan Triggs walks in from the north.
Jonathan Triggs presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an
AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour from storage and sets it in front of him.
An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the
battlesuit's weapons.
Jonathan Triggs presses a button on an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour, which
splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.
An EAOS Plasma Specialist suddenly splits down the front and deposits
Constantine Stone.
Constantine Stone sits down.
Jonathan Triggs says, "Hmm..."
'What?
You ask, "What?"
enter
There is no battlesuit assigned to you present here.
deploy
You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Conjurer
from storage and sets it in front of you.
An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the
battlesuit's weapons.
Jonathan Triggs says, "Wishing I had a Minor Microdrone minimod."
[PA] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident: "Everyone aboard the Fort?"
pa Yep
You speak into the microphone.
Constantine Stone says, "It will be interesting doing this without an AEU suit."
'Yeah
You say, "Yeah."
Jonathan Triggs says, "Yeah.."
'Lily can repair a bit though.
You say, "Lily can repair a bit though."
Constantine Stone nods.
You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."
enter
You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You
carefully climb inside.
You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires
its descent thrusters.
The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering
position near the space station's docking bay.
You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.
Constantine Stone stands up.
Constantine Stone presses a button on an EAOS Plasma Specialist, which splits
open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.
launch
The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.
Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around
Constantine Stone (EAOS Plasma Specialist). The sealed drop pod is quickly
hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of
speed.
launch
You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as
two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial
fortress.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
'Weeeeee!
You speak to yourself in the darkened, claustrophobic confines of your drop pod,
but there is no one to hear you.
You hope.
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.
(20 seconds roundtime.)
With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.
[Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation
system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a
battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending
the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!
You see Constantine Stone (EAOS Plasma Specialist) here.
You can go west.
A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a
burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing
Jonathan Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour).
Constantine Stone says, "Maybe we'll get lucky."
'maybe
You say, "Maybe."

Jonathan Triggs says to Constantine Stone, "How so?"
Jonathan Triggs says, "Oh.. maybe."

You peer west...
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's
amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go north and east.
A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a
burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (League Paladin).
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.
wave
You wave.
Jonathan Triggs says, "Like, it being just around the corner."
Jonathan Triggs says, "SO..."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah would be great to do it in 10 minutes
and turn around and do another."
Jonathan Triggs asks, "How are we doing this?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How we always do?"
'very carefully
You say, "Very carefully."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Jonathan Triggs says to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, "I focus on repairing
you?"
'Without getting blown up.
You say, "Without getting blown up."
Constantine Stone says, "Let's hustle."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to Jonathan Triggs, "Yes and don't shoot
much."
Jonathan Triggs says, "As much as I can, that is."
Jonathan Triggs nods.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

Hi Melinda, Morris has still not obtained parts. I checked the log and there are
two entries where i granted Morris Read/Withdrawal/Deposit rights on SEAS
warehouse. The first occurred on 9/29/2317 and I applied standard access again
on October 11th, 2317. I have also added others who I had previously deleted
such as Evenia and she has been withdrawing modules. Sorry to say it but if
Morris truly wanted us to participate, we could have made arrangements to get
these modules to him. We're doing the best we can to act in good faith here and
to comply with our agreement to cooperate with Morris. Thanks for looking into
this. - Lily

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has

[PA] Jonathan Triggs: "Alright. Lets finish this!"
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

everyone?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Wishing my app wre
accepted. Other than that all is well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Were... I can't talk
today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah. I'm sure it
will be soon enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It's going. Took
done my First IFS in my fighter.. with some assistance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "The assistance was
an Accord destroyer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
received 285,917.12 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating
Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can the capsule
rift drive break down?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And if so, can
all the necessary repairs be made from inside?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh i've done better but it's ok."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh have to wait over an hour to end this
one."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What are people up
to?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Delivering mail,
since it's a bit less boring than salvaging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm plundering
the bubble."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Toll Station from the two-person

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What're the
chances of organizing a Salvage op today, do you all think?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It it's out of the
question for now... how about Nests or Beacons?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No
idea, can't think that far in advance!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I really don't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I am sure eli will
be around later, same as Shule... and possiblely a few others from other
alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I'd calculate
Ather, but.. he's not around long."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm
not that rigid concerning the work I do these days so if it happens, it will
happen!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "True. But,
planning needs to start sometime."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm
not into planning jus tnow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Now
that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Planning something with a number of people is like herding cats. Ever try to do
that in advance?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Heard cats...
hmm..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I won't be doing
much before midnight, I'm afraid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I best refrain
from commenting further... about hearding cats.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah... that's I
figured."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "That's what I
figured."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hey, constantine.
I got one lens out of that Nest from the other day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Was hoping for one
or two from the IFS I brought down.... no luck there."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Anyone hauling
'roids or looking for Locals?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You
can always ask over General or on Tactical."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Probably general is best though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh, that I'll be
doing. Just figured I'd check with my own alliance first.."
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a
new notice.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Coming back on what
lily said, planning ahead with pilots is a nightmare, maybe worse than hearding
cats."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And I am not really
sure what I wanna do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It can be hard
to plan with more than a few people, yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Who still has no
access to the Starseekers warehouse? I thought I had given access to everyone?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not really
sure what parts they were missing or who was missing them, to be honest. Melinda
told me you were running low, but when I checked the warehouse there were plenty
of batteries and arrays."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And when I asked
her I didn't really get a straight answer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"We're good, we have quite a few of everything now between both SEAS and
Starseekers warehouses."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Angel purchased about 25 different ones and we already had a fair numger in
SEAS warehouse."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Where are these
warehouses?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "They can be accessed
from the landing pad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only if you're
authorized to access any to begin with, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ah, cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, that is true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The
warehouses are only accessible to organizations and are accessible form the
Landing Pad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm
not sure probably Morris and his organization is Journey. I had to add him via
his Organization Name and then I added him and provided his access it may be
that if one isn't a Thane or a Vassal this will occur. I'm not sure of others."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Morris definitely has
access to the Starseekers warehouse."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
received 164,453.07 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating
Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Justin."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
well I had added Morris too but it didn't work so I had to remove his access and
then add Journey and then I added Morris but I htink if you just add Journey,
that will work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What a bother. I
won't be able to get a good battery, till I am able to get the Revo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fortunately the
Revo doesn't require much."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the north.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident has automatically contributed 76,395,666.67 AEU credits.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident retrieves a virtual reality suit and puts it on.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. that's

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yo!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hey eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yo ho ho and a bottle of
synthrum."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Eli!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hey it's a Kim."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How is everybody this
morning?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am doing ok,
although it does not quite feel like morning for me right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could use a
bit of synthrum."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Quite the ship...
the Lowell is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I still wish I knew what
happened that spawned those philosophy posts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not that it matters I
guess, they're all valid points. I'ts just sometimes things happen and the
results make them seem bigger than they actually were."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh... probably
some League put a bean under her hat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Probably some people
talking and someone giving a new pilot a lot of, something or another."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for sure, the original
post just makes it sound like someone gave a newer pilot some huge,  decked out
ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Which is rediculous
to do really. We all have to work to get there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Honestly I don't see
anythign wrong with say, buying a cargo hauler in the exampel you gave, there's
nothign wrong with how you handled it either. But there's a just gotta be a lien
somewhere."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan sacastically states, "Oh.. it was
totally because someone hand gifted a Battlecruiser, with all the trimmings, to
me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow
gimme that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Dude, what are we
standing around here for then, let's fire that shit up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I suppose I could
have given a cargo hauler. But it was someone from another alliance who needed
the help. And I had the time to spare."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides north.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, what you did
makes complete sense Kim."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I also could have
taken him roid hauling, although, I don't think he quite had the points for
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Reminds me of that guy
who's always hanging out in the Fringe lounge, carrying on about how he stole a
battlecruiser."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's like man, quit
talking about it, and bust that shit out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If we had a battle
cruiser, I'd love to go show the outsiders what we could do with it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Speaking of
which... does anyone have hydraulic pistons?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I might have some."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh... Apparently I
have a couple... hmm.. wonder where I got those?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who stole a
battlecruiser?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably disassembling
RATS stuff or stuff from beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And from whom?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I have some
hydraulic pistons, quite a few. Do you still need some?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I could use a
couple more.. possibly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Most of my hydraulic
pistons probably come from landing gear sttrus."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What is a couple?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah, I think
that's where I got mine from."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits an irritating burst
of static.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "2."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles. "So a literal couple."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like it
would be tough to get to the point where you have absolutely no resources."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can always
do courier work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And if you can
afford a fighter you can deliver mail."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well. It was
like saturday when that happened, and the courier company only pays once a week,
on friday."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Still, a single
low priority deployment would give you enough scratch to buy a fighter and start
doing other stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe he had
no suit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's also loans, but
thhey may have not had their old loan paid off yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "He did not have a
suit indeed. No ship, and not enough credits for even a fighter and he couldn't
get a loan anymore either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's
true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fortunately for
AEU cadets we have that battlesuit loan that can be drawn on at any time by
anyone, in any amount and for any reason."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But don't clean
it out!"
