Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a
compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the

Subject: On my fate
Author: Constantine Stone
Posted: 20:54 25 September 2317 GST
--
Pilots,
 
I can't begin to apologize enough for how I've let you all down, but I'll make
the only apology I can. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for what I've done to the Union, to
the people I've hurt, and to the corps. I know what I've done is going to make
all of your lives harder, and I would give anything to undo it.
 
That said, the government said they would press no charges against me if I
agreed to uphold my pilot contract, that is, if I acknowledged that there is
nothing I can do to stop Outccord, and if I agreed to work for the Union and her
interests. They weren't clear about what would happen if I declined, but did say
that my license would be revoked at a minimum.
 
I accepted this agreement.
 
I asked for a rough estimate of the damages I caused, and was given an estimate
of 50 billion. I'm only worth 4.5, so I said I would return to work to make the
victims of the tragedy whole in the only way I can. 
 
I understand that many of you are going to find my taking this deal to be
disagreeable. I don't blame you for feeling this way. Part of me feels this way
myself. But if I can do anything to undo the damage I've done, it's my desire
and responsibility to do so.
 
 
Once I've repaid this debt, I may turn in my license with the full understanding
that I'll no longer be adhering to the agreement. At that point the government
will do whatever it wants with me.
 
Part of me had wanted to spend time on Dure learning to forgive myself and live
with what I've done. As I won't be doing that in the near future, I will be
taking a leave of absence. I'm going to try to get details about the crash sites
from the government, and if I can, I plan to spend the next few weeks working in
the damaged communities.
 
Once again, I'm sorry to have let you all down, and I do understand if the way
I've chosen to deal with this makes you think less of me. I look forward to
seeing you all again once I return.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage

what your point was... with the other day. Or, what point you were trying to
make?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, no. Especially not
this most recent tragic course of action. Outccord will go through in a few
days, and there's not really anything else we can do to stop it. It's inevitable
now."

probably inevitable anyways, without this tragic event."

hurt our Corp."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Oh, I read the post. Somehow I missed the name."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't
mention her in the post."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just the deal."
tra 1 oh, ok.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Basically, I go back to

and throw away the key."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Oh, ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I did tell her, however,
that I don't control what the other pilots do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "So
are you going to take the deal too then, Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I already did, Ather. I
understand if you want to kick me out of invaders. I won't blame you at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was
already contemplating ending the strike regardless. We no longer really have a
leg to stand on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's all my fault... I'm
sorry I let you guys down."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's not all
your fault."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And guys, if
they had let me discuss this with you, I would have."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would have
gone to Dure if everyone agreed it was best."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I can still
surrender my license."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Alright then.. Ather."
tra org Please don't surrender your license.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Please don't surrender your license."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like a
dog taking the deal, but I don't have nearly enough money to feel that I've made
the victims whole."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "As much as I
can, at any rate."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I intend to
stay on at least until I accumulate 50 billion for them."

The AEU needs good pilots. We can all help you get through this.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Eli... I'm
curious. How much do you and Stone have to pay for damages? In total."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's one of the most
accurate headlines in a while though. Half expected it ot say that I supported
Outccord now or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There
is no point for them to mince words anymore. They won, we lost."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "She said I just had to go
back to abiding by my contract and not to encourage anymore rising up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
heard me AEU folks! If you haven't already, back to work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Constantine, send a notice stating that the strike is over."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't make
that post on the general board because I figured everyone would find the deal
distasteful. However, it would answer a lot of their questions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
posted it on AEU/general, not general/general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm a little surprised, 
but Iunderstand it. I did tell her that just because Constantine I stopped that
didn't mean everyone would."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know, but it
occurred to me that everyone is going to have questions about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So maybe I
should have posted it on general/general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was
thinking of calling off the strike well before your deals were presented to you
both. I was talking to the other pilots about it yesterday afternoon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "For
pretty much the reaso nI just stated on general comms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah. I mean we didn'
tmean to hurt anyone, but honestly if that didn't have an effect, I'm not sure
what in the hell would have."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm
going to do my own part to help for the recovery. Stay tuned for an
announcement."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And the damages are fifty
billion."
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives
a new notice.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Some good news at least,
she said that the injured will be patched up in no time and that it will be paid
for by Garner Care."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather, I would
like to make sure I pay my full share of the damages."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If that means
paying you back for money you give, I'd still like to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. I can't even afford
a transport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can front you
the money, Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nah constantine, you've
done enough for me already and all it's done is caused you strife. I'll be
alright."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let me do it.
We'll be doing a good thing together."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It might be a
good way to start moving forward."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ather, what
should we do now... about the Outccord? WE know that this is a bad idea. Do we
keep assisting and using our own personal resources to assist the Accord?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well. Ok constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll meet you on
the bridge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe I will have enough
to at least upgrade it a little. I think I've got a ship I could probably sell,
too."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thank you shule."
