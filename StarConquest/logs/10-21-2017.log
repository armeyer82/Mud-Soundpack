00:28 Hi Melinda, Morris has still not obtained parts. I checked the log and there are two entries where i granted Morris Read/Withdrawal/Deposit rights on SEAS warehouse. The first occurred on 9/29/2317 and I applied standard access again on October 11th, 2317. I have also added others who I had previously deleted such as Evenia and she has been withdrawing modules. Sorry to say it but if Morris truly wanted us to participate, we could have made arrangements to get these modules to him. We're doing the best we can to act in good faith here and to comply with our agreement to cooperate with Morris. Thanks for looking into this. - Lily

The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on.

01:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:33 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Omega-3" has launched from New Earth.

01:33 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Upsilon-0" has launched from New Earth.

01:34 I don't understand that.

01:34 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

01:34 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

01:38 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

01:39 Constantine Stone walks in from the north.

01:39 Constantine Stone presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Plasma Specialist from storage and sets it in front of him.

01:39 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:39 Constantine Stone presses a button on an EAOS Plasma Specialist, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:39 Jonathan Triggs walks in from the north.

01:39 Jonathan Triggs presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour from storage and sets it in front of him.

01:39 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:39 Jonathan Triggs presses a button on an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:39 An EAOS Plasma Specialist suddenly splits down the front and deposits Constantine Stone.

01:39 Constantine Stone sits down.

01:40 Jonathan Triggs says, "Hmm..."

01:40 You ask, "What?"

01:40 There is no battlesuit assigned to you present here.

01:40 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Conjurer from storage and sets it in front of you.

01:40 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:40 Jonathan Triggs says, "Wishing I had a Minor Microdrone minimod."

01:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Everyone aboard the Fort?"

01:40 You speak into the microphone.

01:40 Constantine Stone says, "It will be interesting doing this without an AEU suit."

01:40 You say, "Yeah."

01:41 Jonathan Triggs says, "Yeah.."

01:41 You say, "Lily can repair a bit though."

01:41 Constantine Stone nods.

01:41 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."

01:41 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

01:41 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

01:41 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

01:41 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

01:42 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

01:42 Constantine Stone stands up.

01:42 Constantine Stone presses a button on an EAOS Plasma Specialist, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:42 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

01:42 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Constantine Stone (EAOS Plasma Specialist). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

01:42 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

01:42 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:42 You speak to yourself in the darkened, claustrophobic confines of your drop pod, but there is no one to hear you.

01:42 You hope.

01:42 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

01:42 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:42 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

01:42 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You see Constantine Stone (EAOS Plasma Specialist) here.
You can go west.

01:42 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Jonathan Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour).

01:43 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe we'll get lucky."

01:43 You say, "Maybe."

01:43 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)

01:43 Jonathan Triggs says to Constantine Stone, "How so?"

01:43 Jonathan Triggs says, "Oh.. maybe."

01:43 You peer west...

01:43 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go north and east.

01:43 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (League Paladin).

01:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

01:43 You wave.

01:43 Jonathan Triggs says, "Like, it being just around the corner."

01:43 Jonathan Triggs says, "SO..."

01:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah would be great to do it in 10 minutes and turn around and do another."

01:43 Jonathan Triggs asks, "How are we doing this?"

01:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How?"

01:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How we always do?"

01:43 You say, "Very carefully."

01:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:44 Jonathan Triggs says to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, "I focus on repairing you?"

01:44 You say, "Without getting blown up."

01:44 Constantine Stone says, "Let's hustle."

01:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to Jonathan Triggs, "Yes and don't shoot much."

01:44 Jonathan Triggs says, "As much as I can, that is."

01:44 Jonathan Triggs nods.

01:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Moving."

01:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident moves west.

01:44 Constantine Stone moves west.

01:44 You say, "Moldy twins."

01:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Oh tha't just not fair!"

01:45 Jonathan Triggs says, "Shout out if you need reconstruction drones."

01:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So what do you have on your suit Constantine?"

01:45 Constantine Stone says, "Envelop, wave, cascade, erode."

01:45 Constantine Stone says, "Spike."

01:45 Jonathan Triggs says, "Not bad."

01:45 Constantine Stone says, "Arc and hammer."

01:45 Lily says to you, "Ok well be careful on energy."

01:45 Constantine Stone says, "All the usual cool stuff."

01:45 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I will."

02:05 You say, "Well, it's more that they have more experienced pilots."

02:08 Jonathan Triggs says, "Please..."

02:08 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."

02:08 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

02:08 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

02:09 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

02:09 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You can go west.

02:09 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Constantine Stone (EAOS Plasma Specialist).

21:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

21:56 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

21:57 Hi Melinda, Morris has still not obtained parts. I checked the log and there are two entries where i granted Morris Read/Withdrawal/Deposit rights on SEAS warehouse. The first occurred on 9/29/2317 and I applied standard access again on October 11th, 2317. I have also added others who I had previously deleted such as Evenia and she has been withdrawing modules. Sorry to say it but if Morris truly wanted us to participate, we could have made arrangements to get these modules to him. We're doing the best we can to act in good faith here and to comply with our agreement to cooperate with Morris. Thanks for looking into this. - Lily

22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Bew Heh, It only asked for 25000. I brought in 32000.. that shouldn't really matter. (in regards to how much extra)."

22:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:32 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:33 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:33 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:33 The computer reports that the one-person courier "Unreality Programming 089" has launched from New Earth.

22:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:33 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:34 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:34 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
