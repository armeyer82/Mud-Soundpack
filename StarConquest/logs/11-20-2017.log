00:00 Eli, Fomoir of legend gives Sean Sloan a thumbs up!

00:01 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

00:03 Evenia Callseah blinks heavily and then dozes off.

00:08 Sean Sloan scrambles to his feet.

00:08 Sean Sloan walks down.

00:08 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods. "Must have gotten his hanging out in for the day."

00:08 Sean Sloan walks in from below.

00:08 Sean Sloan sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

00:10 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

00:11 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

00:11 Listen. You need to be careful.

00:11 Eli peers out of a viewport.

00:11 Eli, Fomoir of legend takes several bites of a serving of hot pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl, each time happily slurping up the long noodles.

00:14 Eli, Fomoir of legend retrieves several flavorful clumps of noodles near the bottom of the bowl and slurps them up.

00:19 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

00:21 Eli, Fomoir of legend absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

00:24 Ted Warburton wanders in from below.

00:24 Eli, Fomoir of legend waves to Ted Warburton.

00:24 Ted Warburton waves.

00:24 Ted Warburton asks, "How we doing?"

00:24 Ted Warburton sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

00:25 Johann says to Ted, "We are still 20 ltc's from Feng Wo."

00:25 Ted says to Johann, "Go away."

00:25 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "We're moving along. Had to repair the drive a couple of times, and we had some shitty speed for a while, but ti's all good now."

00:25 Ted Warburton laughs.

00:25 Lily Kaise laughs at Johann Schraft.

00:25 Ted Warburton asks, "Damn, two repairs?"

00:25 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods.

00:26 Ted Warburton asks, "How far are we really?"

00:26 Johann Schraft says, "2 ltc's and some change."

00:26 Ted Warburton says, "Nice."

00:28 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

00:29 Ted Warburton says, "I haven't seen this thing before, that's three things I know of fairly close to Feng Wo now."

00:31 Ted Warburton examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

00:31 Ted Warburton helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:31 Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:33 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "There was an asteroid field a little earlier too that looked new."

00:33 Ted Warburton says, "Oh cool."

00:33 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Mostly just because it didn't pop up at the edge of the sensors."

00:33 Johann Schraft asks, "OH man, I hate it when that happens. It's like, where did that come from?"

00:34 Ted Warburton says, "I don't suppose we could survey it on here though."

00:34 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods. "I have the stuff o my sightseer, and it would go to everyone who was on board the ship it launched from."

00:34 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "But I don't think folks want to do that."

00:35 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "And also, no X-ray on the sightseer, and only the second impact probe."

00:35 Ted Warburton nods.

00:37 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

00:40 Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:40 Lily Kaise says, "Well I just need an imager on mine but I don't want to use the few lenses I have."

00:41 Ted Warburton says, "How many do they take? I'm sure I've nothing like enough."

00:41 Johann Schraft asks, "Six?"

00:41 Ted Warburton says, "Oh, thought it was more, I might have enough."

00:41 Lily Kaise says, "6 lenses."

00:42 Lily Kaise says, "'but I seill have to buy the spectrscopes but I do have most of the other stuff installed and I wouldn't have but I forgot about the imager."

00:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:42 Eli, Fomoir of legend grins.

00:43 Ted Warburton says, "I just know I'm going to bankrupt myself within a few weeks of getting home."

00:43 Lily Kaise says, "It will hold 20 probes though which isn't bad for a tiny ship like that."

00:43 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Gotta have the imager before you can get the spectroscope stuff."

00:43 Ted Warburton says, "Makes sense."

00:43 Eli, Fomoir of legend exclaims, "Science missiles!"

00:43 "I jsut said!" Lily Kaise grins at Eli, Fomoir of legend.

00:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:44 Eli says to Lily, "Oh I just didn't know if you realized that they were together is all."

00:44 Ted Warburton says, "Even so, setting up a platform will cost me a hell of a lot."

00:44 Lily Kaise says, "I have 7 lenses but i'm saving up to build something so."

00:44 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "It's fun to probe and scan stuff in the sightseer."

00:44 Eli, Fomoir of legend chuckles.

00:44 Lily Kaise says, "Or help Shule get his Arachnoid built."

00:44 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Just short little trips."

00:44 Lily Kaise nods.

00:45 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, now if I want to run around in one of those, do I then need an extra, or can it drop in and out of the platform, I never know where upgrades live."

00:45 Lily Kaise says, "My platform holds 90 I think."

00:47 Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:47 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

00:47 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

00:47 You smile at Lily Kaise.

00:48 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

00:48 Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

00:48 Evenia blinks, eyeing the rift status displays for a moment.

00:48 Lily says to Eli, "Well it said you and Evenia discovered the other field and I didn't see any other credits in the library."

00:49 Evenia Callseah asks, "Hmm?"

00:49 Damien fidgets.

00:49 Lily Kaise says, "For the probes."

00:49 Eli, Fomoir of legend sighs. "Yeah I know."

00:49 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "For some reason it didn't have anyone listed, and then she wanted to go up and get an image of it. For some reason that put us on there."

00:49 Evenia Callseah asks, "I think that was probably because we didn't launch directly from the ship?"

00:49 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods.

00:49 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah because we weren't there I guess."

00:50 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Yeah you have to launch directly from the ship."

00:50 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. It's a thing I do. I go somewhere new. I always take an image. Even if it's already been imaged. Just like an I was here image. Kinda thing."

00:50 Lily Kaise says, "Well uh."

00:50 Aisling the Fox stretches.

00:50 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

00:50 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "If you do it directly from a ship, everyone on the ship that it launched from gets credit."

00:51 Evenia Callseah shrugs.

00:51 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah nice to wait a tad so others can get credit as well. Just saying but what is done is done."

00:51 Evenia Callseah says, "I figured Mel and all them would be still on record for it, so I didn't even think about that."

00:51 Evenia Callseah says, "I don't do it for credit. That's the thing. Normally when I do that. It's been imaged. As I new that place had."

00:52 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Yeah the image isn't worht anything heh."

00:52 Evenia Callseah coughs. "I knew, also. I can't talk today."

00:52 Lily Kaise says, "Well the image, when it is turned in does pay out to the others."

00:52 Evenia Callseah says, "Well sure. But I don't turn them in."

00:53 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but on an expedition like this, would be nice for others, that's all. Anyway tht's all I'll say."

00:53 Evenia Callseah says, "And as I said. Mel and all those guys imaged and probed it when they were there last time, so I didn't think that image would end up doing what it did."

00:53 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Heh no one is getting credit for it. Melinda and them got all the credit and stuff when they first discovred it."

00:53 Evenia Callseah nods.

00:53 Evenia Callseah says, "That's what I mean. And normally on a trip like this, I would always wait till the main image was taken."

00:58 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

00:59 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

01:00 Ted Warburton says, "Hang on, what happened here? I'm confused."

01:01 Evenia says to Ted, "So I had eli take me up in soul to grab my usual image. But only he and I show in the library for finding that field. But we Know that Mel's trip found, imaged, and probed it."

01:01 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Yeah, it's just hte library part of it."

01:01 Evenia Callseah nods.

01:02 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah. We found a few odd things with who's listed, sometimes people don't show for ages and weird things like that, like a couple of us would show when we started, but more of us by the end."

01:02 Evenia Callseah says, "That's why I just went and got it, because I knew all that had been done."

01:02 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods.

01:02 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, the libary is a mysterious thing."

01:02 Ted Warburton says, "Library even."

01:02 Evenia Callseah nods.

01:03 Ted Warburton says, "I'm sure I remember us finding that one though, as well as Wheel of Tears."

01:03 Lily Kaise says, "When I ren the library, it said Discoverers Evenia and e/li so just saying what I saw as well as a close probe was run."

01:03 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, that is weird, but by no means the first weirdness I've seen with it."

01:03 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. Mel has the image back home."

01:04 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah guess there's some issues with how they are tracking things."

01:04 Evenia Callseah says, "And if it showed a probe. That definitely wasn't us. So that's stuff from Mel's trip. I just got my image and landed."

01:04 Ted says to Lily, "Were you there for any of the weirdness? I can't remember."

01:07 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods. "Yeah before it showed it had been probed and imaged and stuff, but said discoverers as none."

01:07 Eli, Fomoir of legend examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

01:07 Ted Warburton says, "Doesn't surprise me, we saw stuff like that happen too."

01:07 Eli, Fomoir of legend tips the bowl into his mouth and drinks the richly flavored broth, finishing it off.

01:08 Ted Warburton finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

01:08 Ted Warburton gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

01:08 Do you know what they want?

01:09 Evenia Callseah says, "Yes. All the tael."

01:09 Nicolette Lawrence rolls in from below.

01:09 Nicolette Lawrence sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:09 Ted Warburton says, "Mmm, Tael."

01:09 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

01:09 Ted Warburton waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

01:09 Evenia Callseah nods to Nicolette Lawrence.

01:09 Johann Schraft says, "Mmm, tail."

01:09 Nicolette Lawrence waves.

01:09 Damien Alexander waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

01:09 Evenia Callseah laughs.

01:09 Evenia Callseah says, "I say Tael and Ted and Johann's ears prick up."

01:09 Ted Warburton asks, "Mmm, how long are we staying here?"

01:10 Johann Schraft says, "One charging cycle."

01:10 Johann Schraft says, "Max."

01:10 A black digital felo game beeps plaintively for food.

01:10 Eli, Fomoir of legend flaps his arms at Nicolette Lawrence.

01:10 Evenia Callseah laughs.

01:10 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

01:10 Evenia Callseah says, "Here she goes. Wait for it..."

01:10 Nicolette says to Eli, "And stop all that beeping."

01:10 Ted Warburton says, "Beep beep beep."

01:10 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Oh. I thought that was you, never mind."

01:10 Nicolette Lawrence nods.

01:10 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Sorry."

01:10 Ted Warburton says, "Beep beep beep."

01:10 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Nope, I gave up beeping a long time ago."

01:11 Ted Warburton says, "Beep beep beep."

01:11 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Im glad I missed those days."

01:11 Evenia Callseah says, "Now he just flaps randomly."

01:11 Ted Warburton says, "Beep beep beep."

01:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "Ruff ruff."

01:11 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:11 Remember what I said.

01:12 Evenia Callseah giggles at Nissi Valdaire.

01:12 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

01:12 Ted Warburton says, "Meow."

01:13 Johann Schraft asks, "Why is it bad to get oral sex on a train?"

01:13 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "I don't know!"

01:13 Damien Alexander smirks at Johann Schraft.

01:13 Johann Schraft says, "Because of all the pressure to chew chew."

01:13 Damien Alexander snorts.

01:13 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:13 Evenia Callseah groans while looking at Johann Schraft.

01:13 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:13 Damien says to Johann, "That's awful."

01:13 Johann Schraft grins.

01:14 Evenia Callseah sighs.

01:14 Evenia Callseah says, "I move to demote the founder."

01:14 Evenia Callseah grins.

01:14 Johann Schraft says, "Denied."

01:14 Damien Alexander exclaims, "Seconded!"

01:14 Ted Warburton says, "Seconded."

01:14 Damien Alexander snaps his fingers.

01:14 Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Damn it!"

01:14 Ted Warburton says, "We need a gag for him."

01:14 Sean Sloan says to Evenia, "You are powerless in the face of the founder."

01:15 Johann Schraft whistles at Ted Warburton.

01:15 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:15 Damien Alexander chuckles.

01:15 Evenia says to Sean Sloan, "Don't be so positive. It's painful."

01:16 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:16 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

01:18 Damien slips off the sofa and scoots up to sit next to Evenia.

01:18 Damien Alexander stands up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

She appears to be 23 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and attractive calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is heart-shaped and pretty, with a button nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are satiny soft and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of glistening white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are sparkling turquoise and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is silvery blonde and loosely styled and left to fall freely down her back. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails. She has a shimmering gold barrette inset with small sapphires, a beautiful red crystal rose hairpin, and a shimmering gold barrette inset with small sapphires in her hair. She has a small interestingly-shaped birthmark on her right cheek.
A small enameled sapphire butterfly pierces her left cheek.
 She is wearing a silver flightsuit, a beautiful diamond wrist cuff, and a pair of light-weight black ship shoes. She is also wearing a pair of stunning diamond-nested tanzanite teardrop chandelier earrings, a delicate gold chain necklace, a finely crafted skull pendant of red and silver dichroic glass on a slender gold chain, a gold link bracelet with numerous small skull charms of red and silver dichroic glass, a delicate white gold link bracelet with a single red crystal spider susp
01:23 ended from it, a white stone ring with a silver band, a roaring metallic gold tigress stamp, a silver touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a neon purple vibro-baton, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, and a golden Feng Wo coin purse. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, right wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

01:25 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:25 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:25 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:25 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

01:25 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

01:26 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

01:26 Lily Kaise glides in from below.

01:26 Lily Kaise sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:26 Johann Schraft walks in from below.

01:26 Evenia Callseah trudges in from below.

01:26 Nissi Valdaire walks in from below.

01:26 Damien Alexander tramps in from below.

01:26 Ted Warburton wanders in from below.

01:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "1.8 by the way."

01:26 Ted Warburton sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:26 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:27 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Not bad."

01:27 Eli, Fomoir of legend applauds at Nissi Valdaire.

01:27 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

01:27 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:27 You grin.

01:27 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:28 Damien Alexander sighs quietly.

01:28 Johann Schraft raises an eyebrow at Damien Alexander.

01:28 Evenia Callseah gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:28 Evenia Callseah trudges down.

01:29 Johann says to Damien, "Something wrong?"

01:29 Damien opens his mouth to speak, then closes it again.

01:29 Nicolette says to Damien, "Cut it with the drama."

01:30 Damien Alexander glares at Nicolette Lawrence.

01:30 Damien says to Nicolette, "Yer not gonna get it started."

01:30 Damien Alexander tramps down.

01:30 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Glare all you awnt. Just drop the drama."

01:30 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Aisling the Fox's neck.

01:32 Evenia Callseah trudges in from below.

01:32 Evenia Callseah says, "Craft little robot, craft."

01:32 Evenia Callseah sits down on a large sandy brown floor pillow.

01:32 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Yes, craft craft craft."

01:32 Evenia Callseah grins.

01:33 Nicolette Lawrence asks, "What are you crafting?"

01:33 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Just circuit boards."

01:33 Evenia Callseah says, "I gave Johann a bunch of circuit boards yesterday, so good little alexay is working on topping them up again."

01:33 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "The acid mixtures right now. I got pretty low on stuff."

01:33 Johann Schraft says, "I have a grand total of not enough circuit boards."

01:33 Johann Schraft says, "I should make Raiatea work as well."

01:33 Evenia says to Eli, "Wait, that's hilarious. Gadget and alexay are crafting the same things."

01:34 Johann Schraft scrambles to his feet.

01:34 Johann Schraft walks down.

01:34 Ted Warburton says, "I can never thing of anything high value to craft, and I don't have the blueprints for the things I'd go for yet."

01:34 Ted Warburton says, "Tools don't often seem to go any more."

01:34 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm just crafting those things you always need, and always run out of."

01:35 Sean Sloan stands up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:35 Sean Sloan walks down.

01:35 Ted Warburton says, "And all my robots are busy, I don't have a spare to bring along just yet."

01:36 Evenia says to Ted, "Give me 2 lenses and help out with bricks, and I'll make you one whenever."

01:36 Ted Warburton says, "Thanks."

01:36 Evenia says to Ted, "It will need...48 bricks."

01:36 Lily Kaise stands up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:36 Lily Kaise glides down.

01:37 Ted Warburton says, "I can see one of them will be busy when we get back."

01:38 Evenia Callseah grins.

01:38 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

01:38 Evenia says to Ted, "I don't mind covering all the other crap. Just those things and I'll whip it up for ya."

01:38 You peer down...

01:38 
[Starship "Future Crimes"; Main Deck]
Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the distance. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade, a soft square cream rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick purple fringe, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, and a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders" here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:38 Lily Kaise glides in from below.

01:38 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:38 Lily Kaise sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:39 Ted Warburton says, "I can probably give you most or all of the other crap now anyway."

01:39 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:39 Evenia Callseah nods.

01:39 Evenia says to Ted, "The part that takes the most, is the control thing. That's like insane number of boards. Other than that it's just metals mostly."

01:39 Ted Warburton says, "I can probably actually make the vast majority of it now, I think I'm like one blueprint short or something."

01:40 Ted says to Evenia, "Remember when we made Ray, and we kept having to make bits for each other, but we could do it between us?"

01:40 Evenia Callseah grins and nods to Ted Warburton.

01:41 Ted Warburton says, "That was fun."

01:41 "Remember when we put all those parts together for your storage bot?" Evenia Callseah chuckles. "Man that took an age."

01:41 Ted Warburton says, "I know right."

01:42 Evenia Callseah says, "I had the same with Nicolette's. Fun times."

01:42 Ted Warburton says, "And that thing comes in so often, even though I'm not the biggest salvager around."

01:43 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm not either. Totally hate salvaging. Can't stand it."

01:43 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, right."

01:43 You ask, "What's salvaging?"

01:43 Evenia Callseah giggles.

01:43 You say, "I don't know if I remember how to salvage."

01:43 You glance around at your surroundings.

01:43 Ted Warburton says, "I really haven't done much for ages actually."

01:43 Evenia Callseah says, "Forgive me for insulting you, beautiful salvage."

01:44 Ted says to Evenia, "Are you up to your Mighty VI yet?"

01:44 Lily Kaise says, "I need to do some more for our org though to meet a couple of goals."

01:44 Lily looks at shule.

01:44 Evenia says to Ted, "Not quite, but almost."

01:44 You say, "Yeah, I probably should too."

01:44 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, we have goals too."

01:44 Ted says to Evenia, "Way ahead of me now then, good on you."

01:44 Ted Warburton smiles.

01:44 Evenia says to Ted, "Well almost is a bit of a stretch. Before this trip I took a good 2 weeks, just for me."

01:45 Ted Warburton says, "So did I, nobody was doing much so I took a break from most things."

01:45 Evenia Callseah nods.

01:45 Johann Schraft walks in from below.

01:45 Johann Schraft says, "I need a zafu."

01:45 Johann Schraft sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:45 Evenia Callseah says, "I needed it. I love working. And I work fucking hard. But sometimes. You just gotta relax. Kick back. And do all of nothing. Of course I did all my station duties. But yeah."

01:46 Johann Schraft says, "If I stole the one from crias, how long do you think it would take for someone to complain? As far as I know I'm the only one who ever uses it."

01:46 Ted Warburton asks, "Exactly, somebody else needs to look after Fringe some of the time, oh, wait, who's left?"

01:46 Johann says to Evenia, "Lexie will do a good job."

01:46 Evenia says to Johann, "I have like 3 at home for some reason. I'll give you one. I have no clue how I ended up with 3."

01:47 Evenia Callseah nods.

01:47 Evenia Callseah says, "Lexie is a good person. I know she'll do her best with things."

01:47 Evenia Callseah says, "I know mostly people see her silly side, but yeah. You can rely on her."

01:47 Ted Warburton says, "I've a lot of time for Lexie."

01:49 Evenia Callseah says, "And sometimes she's more observant than you'd imagine. I was going through a rough time recently, and randomly I get a package with these cute tiger-striped pillows from her with a note, telling me she hoped they made me smile."

01:49 Ted Warburton says, "Oh, she knows stuff, she's not a huge worker, but she's great at making people smile."

01:49 Evenia Callseah says, "She is."

01:50 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

01:51 Evenia smiles contentedly at the birds.

01:58 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "I saw a bird once."

01:58 Evenia Callseah gasps at Eli, Fomoir of legend.

01:58 Evenia says to Eli, "You did?"

01:58 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods.

01:58 Eli, Fomoir of legend flaps his arms and absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet. "It went like this."

01:59 Evenia giggles helplessly at Eli.

02:00 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

02:01 Ted Warburton asks, "Can we send Eli out there to lead the flock?"

02:01 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:01 Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Go Eli go!"

02:01 Ted Warburton says, "Flap flap flap."

02:03 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

02:04 Evenia Callseah says, "Hey, he's good luck. He flapped before and we're getting more speed."

02:04 Ted Warburton laughs.

02:09 Ted Warburton scrambles to his feet.

02:09 Ted Warburton wanders down.

02:09 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:09 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:09 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:09 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:10 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "The final charting!"

02:10 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

02:10 Nissi Valdaire walks down.

02:10 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:10 Evenia Callseah stands up from a large sandy brown floor pillow.

02:10 Evenia Callseah trudges down.

02:10 Lily Kaise says, "Staying put."

02:10 Lily Kaise grins.

02:10 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No, the drive didn't break, I promise. You can all relax, remain calm."

02:11 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "We know."

02:11 You grin.

02:11 Lily Kaise says, "Nissi said before she went down."

02:11 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It was a...joke."

02:11 Johann Schraft says into the PA microphone, "We're out of charge! Everyone in their spacesuits, and start gathering up your charge boosters to get us the rest of the way!"

02:11 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

02:11 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Kill those bots! They're sucking up all the charge."

02:12 Lily Kaise puts a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:12 Lily Kaise puts a hyperspanner in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:14 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:14 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:14 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:14 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

02:14 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

02:15 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "24 LGC. Who's gonna do the approach?"

02:15 Evenia Callseah trudges in from below.

02:15 Eli, Fomoir of legend points at Evenia Callseah.

02:15 Eli, Fomoir of legend stands up from a traditional round gray zafu.

02:15 Eli, Fomoir of legend wanders down.

02:15 Johann Schraft nods to Evenia Callseah.

02:15 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

02:15 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "I'd kinda like to suggest Johann, since this is his trip."

02:15 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Good idea!"

02:16 Evenia Callseah nods to Johann Schraft.

02:16 Eli, Fomoir of legend wanders in from below.

02:16 Johann Schraft says into the PA microphone, "Well then."

02:16 Evenia says to Johann, "You've waited as long as I have. If not more. And suffered so many losses and disasters because of trips. You do this."

02:16 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:16 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

02:16 Johann Schraft smiles at Evenia Callseah.

02:16 Johann Schraft stands up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

02:16 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

02:16 Johann Schraft walks down.

02:17 Eli, Fomoir of legend removes a small package from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:17 Evenia says to Eli, "Guy deserves it. He's had one thing go wrong after another. Not the least was losing his galleon."

02:17 Eli, Fomoir of legend puts a small package in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:17 Eli, Fomoir of legend removes a rectangular package of Choco Grapeshot from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:17 Eli, Fomoir of legend wanders down.

02:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that made me sad. Shule and I enjoyed some nice travel in Queen Brynn."

02:18 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:18 Evenia Callseah says, "It killed me too. Seeing Johann like that was just...Yeah. he deserves this approach. if anyone does."

02:19 You nod.

02:19 Lily Kaise says, "I've done so many I am always happy to see less-experienced pilots do those. I learned form Nissi initially."

02:19 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I don't pussyfoot I go full steam ahead!"

02:19 Evenia Callseah says, "He's good at them. But I know this is a huge milestone for him. Though he's keeping calm about it."

02:19 Eli, Fomoir of legend wanders in from below.

02:20 Eli, Fomoir of legend sits down on a traditional round gray zafu.

02:20 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:20 Eli, Fomoir of legend says into the PA microphone, "Johann, the trick is to point the ship at the thing."

02:20 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "And not the ass of the ship, the nose."

02:21 Eli, Fomoir of legend says into the PA microphone, "Yes never ass to nose."

02:21 Eli, Fomoir of legend shrugs helplessly.

02:21 Evenia Callseah giggles.

02:22 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey, I can parallel park like a novice!"

02:22 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Hahaha."

02:22 Eli, Fomoir of legend laughs.

02:23 Nissi Valdaire walks in from below.

02:23 Ted Warburton wanders in from below.

02:23 Ted Warburton sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

02:24 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:24 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

02:25 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I'd declare it's wine time but there's some nice brew on Feng Wo still if you want wine it's here!"

02:26 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "What should I whine about? Oh, not that whine."

02:26 Lily Kaise says, "Tom town has the best selection of brews from this region though."

02:26 Lily Kaise tickles you!

02:26 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:26 You chuckle.

02:26 Ted Warburton says, "This place has the best food from any region though."

02:26 Lily Kaise nods to Ted Warburton.

02:26 Evenia Callseah sighs at you. "Just because the typical one for bad jokes is making the approach, we don't need you to step it."

02:26 Evenia Callseah coughs. "In."

02:27 You say to Evenia, "I couldn't resist."

02:27 Evenia Callseah grins at you.

02:27 You grin.

02:27 Ted Warburton asks, "How far out are we now?"

02:27 Eli, Fomoir of legend asks, "Like 20LGC?"

02:27 Evenia Callseah says, "A few LGC."

02:27 Ted Warburton says, "Nice."

02:27 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Should pop up on the scanners anytime now."

02:27 Evenia Callseah nods and nods.

02:28 Ted Warburton says, "You only see it close up if I remember."

02:28 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Once it pops up we can be like, "yep there it is." And then turn around and go home."

02:28 Eli, Fomoir of legend pats Evenia Callseah on the back.

02:28 Evenia Callseah pokes Eli, Fomoir of legend in the ribs!

02:28 Ted Warburton laughs.

02:28 Ted Warburton says, "We should send somebody other than Eve out for suplies and go straight home."

02:28 Ted Warburton says, "Supplies."

02:28 Evenia glares playfully at Ted.

02:29 Ted Warburton smiles at Evenia Callseah.

02:29 You chuckle.

02:30 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh."

02:30 Eli, Fomoir of legend licks his nose with wonderful discovery and enjoyment.  Noticing the blushing skintone, you quickly turn your head.

02:30 Lily Kaise asks, "Interesting that I don't think anyone has been able to trade for a Lizard in a couple of years perhaps?"

02:30 Evenia Callseah chortles at Eli, Fomoir of legend.

02:30 Eli says to Evenia, "You saw nothing."

02:30 Evenia Callseah says, "Don't remind me. Hopefully one day."

02:30 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I'll do a Tristan right here!"

02:30 Eli, Fomoir of legend asks, "Oh, has it been that long?"

02:31 Eli, Fomoir of legend asks, "Do a Tristan?"

02:31 Eli looks baffled.

02:31 Lily pinches her nose.

02:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:31 Evenia Callseah chuckles.

02:31 Ted Warburton says, "All the noses."

02:31 Eli, Fomoir of legend absently sniffs at the air.

02:31 Evenia Callseah nods and grins.

02:31 Lily Kaise wrinkles her nose.

02:31 Lily Kaise says, "I used to love ot ask him if he was having nose trouble."

02:31 Eli flares his nostrils.

02:31 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh shit. He's gonna start sniffing everything now. Let's see if he dares sniff Ather."

02:32 Ted Warburton laughs.

02:32 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:32 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "I'm telling you guys, sniffing each other instead of shakign hands is gonna catch on,  big time."

02:32 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:32 Eli, Fomoir of legend sniffs at himself.

02:32 Ted Warburton laughs.

02:33 Evenia Callseah says, "Here we go."

02:33 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Nah, I'll spare everyone this time."

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "Was Tristan and Goss who decided to take off with the Module Transporter without Annie an left us all in a big of a bind so we had to leave t site earlier than anticipated."

02:33 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Last time I accidently sniffed someone who was asleep and it ended up looking creepier than usual."

02:33 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:33 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:33 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

02:33 Evenia Callseah says, "How did you manage to look, more creepy than usual? I mean..."

02:34 Ted Warburton laughs.

02:34 Eli says to Evenia, "Because they were asleep and unaware of it."

02:34 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "So other people were like, look at this creep.""

02:34 Evenia says to Eli, "Sure, but you look super creepy anyway."

02:34 You exclaim, "I thought it was my job to look creepy!"

02:34 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh. That reminds me."

02:34 Ted Warburton says, "Joel has you all done on actual, real, creepiness."

02:35 Evenia Callseah unbuttons and opens a long white coat with a dragonfly embroidered on the back.

02:35 Evenia Callseah slides out of a long white coat with a dragonfly embroidered on the back.

02:35 Eli, Fomoir of legend cheers.

02:35 Evenia Callseah gives a long white coat with a dragonfly embroidered on the back to Eli, Fomoir of legend.

02:35 Eli, Fomoir of legend exclaims, "Nwo take off the shoe! The shoe!"

02:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "Scene one. Day. Interior. We're aboard a starship. Some people sit on a sofa. Others sit on other things."

02:35 Eli, Fomoir of legend pulls on a long white coat with a dragonfly embroidered on the back.

02:35 Eli, Fomoir of legend grins at Evenia Callseah. "Thanks."

02:36 Evenia Callseah grins at Eli, Fomoir of legend. "You're welcome."

02:36 Evenia Callseah pulls out a small key and pushes it into a blue vinyl duffel bag's lock.

02:36 Evenia Callseah opens a blue vinyl duffel bag.

02:36 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

02:36 Evenia Callseah removes a frayed dark red double-breasted trenchcoat from a blue vinyl duffel bag.

02:36 Evenia Callseah pulls on a frayed dark red double-breasted trenchcoat.

02:36 Evenia Callseah closes a blue vinyl duffel bag.

02:36 Evenia Callseah turns a small key in the lock of a blue vinyl duffel bag and then pockets the key.

02:37 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:37 Eli, Fomoir of legend gasps suddenly.

02:37 Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Thing!"

02:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "A lizard tastes the air. A woman unlocks and locks her purse. The computer beeps ominously."

02:37 Ted Warburton says, "There it is."

02:37 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "It's some sort.. space station thing."

02:37 Evenia Callseah giggles at Nissi Valdaire.

02:38 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Hey, it's a thing! We should like, stop there."

02:38 Ted Warburton says, "We've no Angel to go round everybody's lap, to be commented about."

02:38 Aisling the Fox says, "Hum."

02:38 Eli, Fomoir of legend asks, "Suddenly there's a ding, someone's ramen appears to be done.. but who's?"

02:38 Aisling the Fox examines a robotic chef named Nellie for a moment.

02:38 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

02:38 Aisling the Fox helps herself to a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake.

02:38 Aisling the Fox dangles a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake in front of a Tardick lizard named Thor. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

02:41 Ted says to Eli, "You gave it to me because you know I'm so poor."

02:42 Evenia says to Eli, "Hey. I won those two tail, in fair bets."

02:43 Eli Grey grins.

02:43 Aisling the Fox removes a stylized leaping fox stamp from a worn and tattered brown leather satchel.

02:43 Lily Kaise says, "Too bad for the sleepers aboard who will miss out on Feng Wo Station."

02:43 Evenia Callseah says, "The second one being the best. He swore up-side-down that Mel's ship had freeze pods."

02:43 Eli Grey says, "Well, I know better than to bet tael on things with you."

02:43 Ted says to Eli, "Don't take her on at bets."

02:43 Aisling the Fox quickly reaches out and stamps Ather Jammoa with a stylized leaping fox stamp, leaving him slightly marked-up but otherwise uninjured.

02:43 Eli Grey nods to Ted Warburton. "Yeah, I know that now."

02:44 Eli Grey says, "On sleeping peple, in general."

02:44 Evenia Callseah says, "This was Mel's um. Not her galleon. The other ship."

02:44 Evenia Callseah says, "Eli was like completely certain it had freeze pods."

02:44 Lily Kaise says, "Her science Vessle doesn't either."

02:44 Eli Grey says, "It was Live long in Prosper."

02:44 Evenia Callseah nods.

02:44 Ted Warburton says, "Nah, that ship's too nice for those things."

02:45 Evenia Callseah says, "I know it doesn't. But he was like. Totally sure it did."

02:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:45 Eli Grey says, "It was because she took me in there to show me what it's like to freze, but I didn't realize she dragged me into a dock ship when she did."

02:45 Ted Warburton shivers.

02:45 Aisling the Fox says, "Freeze pods are fine way to sleep."

02:45 Ted Warburton says, "I can't get used to them."

02:45 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh I've slept in them before. Not my favorite thing to do!"

02:45 Eli Grey says, "I do'nt mind becoming a meat popsicle."

02:45 You nod. "Me too."

02:45 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, I would if I had to."

02:45 Eli Grey says, "It is pretty weird though."

02:45 Evenia Callseah says, "If I needed to use them. I would. No questions asked. But if I have a choice. No thanks."

02:45 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it is."

02:45 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

02:46 Eli Grey says, "I should just start sleeping in one every night to build up a tolerance."

02:46 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Talk about being uncomfortably numb!"

02:46 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:46 You chuckle.

02:46 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:46 Evenia Callseah says, "I hate seeing people inside them. Like threw the window."

02:46 Evenia Callseah shudders.

02:46 Lily Kaise nods.

02:47 You say, "Yeah, not very pleasant."

02:47 Eli Grey says, "Because they're frozen, or because they're naked."

02:47 Evenia Callseah shakes her head.

02:47 Lily Kaise says, "Especially that they are totally naked. There should be a curtain drawn or something."

02:47 Evenia Callseah says, "Because they're screaming, and beating at the inside of the tank."

02:47 You nod.

02:47 Aisling the Fox says, "Sure, but they do not know it anymore. They are frozen."

02:47 Ted Warburton shivers.

02:47 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh I know they don't know it, but I do."

02:47 Evenia Callseah says, "That's the part I hate."

02:49 You chuckle.

02:49 Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:49 Ted Warburton laughs.

02:49 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow?"

02:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:50 Ted says to Evenia, "I think we're being pushed away."

02:50 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

02:51 Evenia Callseah says, "I am trying so hard, not to dance around with excitement. This is difficult."

02:51 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Aisling the Fox's neck.

02:51 Ted says to Evenia, "Ooo, dance for us."

02:51 Aisling the Fox says, "It is really not that exciting of a place."

02:51 Evenia Callseah says, "It's more that I've wanted to come here for over a year. So it's built up."

02:52 Aisling the Fox says, "Alliance planets and stations have much more going on."

02:52 Evenia Callseah nods.

02:52 Ted Warburton says, "It's very different though."

02:52 Evenia Callseah says, "But that's one of the things I love about stations out here. They have their own things going on. It's totally different to back home. I enjoy the atmosphere."

02:52 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe something will stop us at the last second."

02:52 Eli Grey grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh the suspense!"

02:53 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:53 Evenia Callseah says, "I think I'd scream."

02:55 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "One charging cycle."

02:55 Eli Grey asks, "There's hotel rooms?"

02:55 Lily Kaise says, "Yep ther is."

02:55 Evenia Callseah says, "Apparently."

02:55 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'd say don't stay off the ship."

02:55 Eli Grey asks, "How long is a charging cycle?"

02:55 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Well i'll go take a look before we leave."

02:55 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

02:55 Ted Warburton says, "However long it takes to charge."

03:11 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:11 Against the wash of distant stars, a bright roughly cubical object can be seen gleaming here as if in defiance of the darkness of the void. The station is comprised of individual sections that appear to be of varying sizes and ages, with one of the oldest being a clearly well-maintained docking bay placed to one side of the unusual structure.

03:11 Sean Sloan presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:11 You cheer.

03:12 Aisling the Fox presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:12 Aisling the Fox says, "I found a thing."

03:12 Lily Kaise says, "I love this sight."

03:12 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "Nicely done, Johann. Beautiful."

03:12 Nissi Valdaire walks down.

03:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:12 Shule smiles excitedly.

03:12 Eli Grey grins.

03:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:12 Lily Kaise forcefully hurls a small white snowball at Ather Jammoa.

03:12 A small white snowball smacks into Ather Jammoa and immediately explodes into a shower of glittery snow!

03:12 Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:12 Lily Kaise snickers.

03:12 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please remain seated with your hands and legs inside the ship until the ship has come to a complete stop."

03:12 Evenia Callseah dances down.

03:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:12 Lily Kaise glides down.

03:12 Ted Warburton wanders down.

03:12 Evenia Callseah's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Fuck that!"

03:13 [Starship "Future Crimes"; Main Deck]

03:13 You see a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade, a soft square cream rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick purple fringe, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, and a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders" here.
Evenia Callseah and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

03:13 Lily Kaise glides north.

03:13 Evenia Callseah dances north.

03:13 [Starship "Future Crimes"; Control Room]

03:13 You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, a small mahogany trash bin, a black leather sectional sofa with a large deep purple and white paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe on it, a black storage locker, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small oval mahogany rattan table with a glass top, a large turquoise and coral pink paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, and a soft square cream rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick purple fringe here.

03:13 [Feng Wo Station; Docking Bay]

03:13 Pieced together almost haphazardly from mismatched metal sheets and yet massively overbuilt, as though every small flaw in the sheeting was replaced with an excessively large metal plate, this docking bay is neither large nor attractive nor very clean. The deck is dark and dirty, and the walls, originally apparently painted reddish orange, are stained with splotches of blackish soot and oil. However, the throng of people here seem not to care in the slightest about the bay's aesthetic shortcomings. The noisy, colorful crowd of possibly a hundred people mill around the starships docked here, bowing to each other and chatting and seeming to watch very carefully who exits from each ship. A large hatch leads northwest out of the bay.

03:13 [Feng Wo Station; Charging of Stars Utilization]

03:13 There's very little room to move around in here because of crates and piles of junk stacked everywhere, among them large but lightweight shiny black panels with cables hanging off them as though they're supposed to be attached to something else.
Lily Kaise is standing here.

03:13 Lily Kaise says, "This is where you buy the solars."

03:14 [Feng Wo Station; Corridor]

03:14 Colorful posters cover the metal walls here, advertising shops and services available in the station, the posters in such abundance that they nearly obscure the hatches northeast and southwest to vital station services. Beneath a long string of red lanterns down the center of the ceiling, noisy, brightly dressed people with their arms full of packages scurry by in a steady stream, jostling each other in their haste and calling out polite apologies as they hurry past.

03:15 [Feng Wo Station; Market]

03:15 An old-style market place thrives in this wide L-shaped corridor. Red and orange lanterns hang from the ceiling, casting a warm glow over throngs of colorfully dressed people shopping at small booths set up along the walls of the corridor and down its center. Vendors call out to the many passersby, gesturing and holding up their merchandise for inspection. At the west end of the corridor, several elderly people drink tea and play an odd game of tiles set up on low black tables. They seem completely oblivious to the near chaos around them. The wide corridor continues to the north and west, and, nearly hidden by the numerous advertisements plastered to the metal walls, smaller corridors lead somewhere east and south.

03:15 [Feng Wo Station; Sheathing of Foots Alley]

03:15 Racks and racks of shoes line the gray walls of this narrow alley. They are of a few styles of slippers and soft boots like those worn by residents of the station. Older men oversee the inspection and sale of the footwear, nodding with friendly smiles at customers, especially if they seem to be tourists. Several similar narrow alleys lead away from here into the depths of the station, but each one is secured by a locked barred door, and you can't see much of what's there, but in the midst of them, an open stairway leads downward to a lower level.

03:15 You grin.

03:15 [Feng Wo Station; Yao Mu Alley]

03:15 This narrow alley is rather dark, but illuminated by a short string of white lanterns is a single vendor's cart with a display of tiny miniature plants in lacquered wooden bowls. An elderly woman stands by the cart, nodding and smiling in response to any interest shown in the delicate plants. Several other alleys lead away from here, but they are secured behind sturdy barred doorways and cannot be accessed.

03:16 Shopkeepers call out from their booths along this wide L-shaped corridor to scores of colorfully dressed people hurrying by. Overhead, bright red and orange lanterns cast a cheerful light over the scene, flickering occasionally with small power fluctuations. The sounds of tiny bells comes from one booth here, and the rich aroma of seared meat comes from another. Nearly lost among numerous advertisements plastered to the gray metal walls are the entrances to narrow alleys to the north, northeast, and east.

03:33 Visible behind the gated doorways on one side of this alley is a cramped factory where large looms work ceaselessy to create rolled bolts of colored and printed fabrics, and on the other side is a workshop where tailors, male and female, labor to create clothing sewn of those fabrics. The air is filled with a combination of sounds: the rumble of the heavy machinery, the incessant chatter of the workers, and the exclamations of shoppers coming to examine the brightly hued garments displayed on racks beneath the lanterns strung from the ceiling along the corridor. A twisting stairway leads down from here to the main level of the station.

03:38 a miniature red and gold pagoda

03:38 This red pagoda measures twenty centimeters on each side. It has a traditional sloping roof with a small golden-eyed red dragon at each corner, and the sides are comprised of clear plastic panels perforated with tiny regularly spaced air holes. Inside the pagoda is a carefully arranged landscape. Decaying plant matter and clumps of moss-covered pebbles cover the floor, half hiding the roots of a penjing ginkgo tree growing up from the center of the pagoda, its delicate branches laden with small scalloped leaves. Beneath the tree, a shallow golden cup filled with slow-growing lacy blue fungus sits near a clump of tiny pink flowers irrigated by a slender funnel of hydrophilic netting. Occasionally, a small red cricket with large, delicately veined wings can be seen moving around among the pebbles and flowers. On the square red lacquered base of the pagoda is a gold plaque reading: 'Cricket of Singing and Good Luck Bringing.'

03:43 [Feng Wo Station; Market]

03:43 An old-style market place thrives in this wide L-shaped corridor. Red and orange lanterns hang from the ceiling, casting a warm glow over throngs of colorfully dressed people shopping at small booths set up along the walls of the corridor and down its center. Vendors call out to the many passersby, gesturing and holding up their merchandise for inspection. At the west end of the corridor, several elderly people drink tea and play an odd game of tiles set up on low black tables. They seem completely oblivious to the near chaos around them. The wide corridor continues to the north and west, and, nearly hidden by the numerous advertisements plastered to the metal walls, smaller corridors lead somewhere east and south.
