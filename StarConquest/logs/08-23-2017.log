00:01:42 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

00:02:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Registered merchants, when you trade at Union ports you fund a leader that punishes his people for disagreement. For those on the ground that have no voice, lend them yours. Please consider taking your cargo to other ports."

00:02:42 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

00:03:11 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And do something that the pilots of the AEU have failed to do because they don't know what the word strike means."

00:03:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you want to help, then knock off that kinda talk. That's fine if you want to feel that way but making a joke out of the strike is not helping."

00:04:15 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh, you're doing that all on your own."

00:04:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I don't think he's joking."

00:04:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And no, I'm not."

00:04:38 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's fucking painful to watch the stupidity meter rise higher and higher."

00:05:07 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Don't preach what you yourself can't follow."

00:05:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, you're totally not ridiculing the people trying to do something right now."

00:05:38 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I wouldn't be ridiculing them if they were actually trying."

00:05:46 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Doesn't seem to me that they are."

00:06:10 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or is helping their wallets making a statement."

00:06:32 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm pretty sure it is, just not the one you intended."

00:07:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We appreciate the support, and just so you know as of yesterday the strike has gone into all catagories. Last time I checked we don't have to report what we're doing to everyone."

00:08:42 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

00:08:57 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Whatever makes you feel better, whatever makes you feel better. I'll believe it when I see it."

00:09:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And I believe your comments about all this were directed towards me for making an actual statement to merchants trying to persuade them not to trade."

00:09:42 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I just get really annoyed watching someone try to get someone else do something that they themselves arn't willing to do."

00:09:48 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And with that, I am actually done."

00:10:05 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rip your sock off and stuff it in your mouth. It'll help you shut up since you can't seem to shut up."

00:10:05 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I do hope the merchantsw ill listen and join your efferts. I also hope the other pilots who believe in this noble cause will do the same."

00:10:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And what exactly makes you think that I'm not willing to do it?"

00:10:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sorry. Erik's been running his mouth non stop."

00:10:51 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I wasn't necessarily picking on you in particular. The rest of your alliance though, if you don't see it, you're not looking hard enough."

00:11:34 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Having said that, I will not be including AEU orgs in any work related stations until further notice. I cannot speak for other builders."

00:11:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm the one who laid out the rules of the strike, I'm not saying that I didn't make mistakes in that, but they followed what I had laid out."

00:12:08 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Unless you know why I should not do that."

00:12:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think they'd be fine on stations that don't make money."

00:13:16 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But that's up to the orgs that woudl deal in that kinda thing."

00:13:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Erik's a dick."

00:13:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Pardon my French."

00:14:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Well, if Nissi wishes me to do otherwise, that's fine. If not, I won't be using AEU org parts for now."

00:14:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constantine endymion is a hot spot right now if you are interested."

00:15:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I am, but I might need until midnight, or at least another hour."

00:16:02 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "AEU's gotta do this themselves. Doesn't matter if they strike or not, work or not, where they put their debris, whatever. If they're serious about stopping Best, they gotta decide what to do and commit to it. Nobody can force em and Best would only twist it around on us if we tried."

00:16:08 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "That's my opinion anyway."

00:16:41 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Would you like me to continue using their parts then? Or let Eli advise me on that."

00:17:34 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Let the AEU make that call I think."

00:17:46 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay."

00:18:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Y'all can let me know then Eli."

00:18:43 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

00:21:42 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

00:24:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If things are needed that don't give an org money I would say it's fine. I haven't been in charge of parts for a long time. I know the alliance doesn't get poitns from them directly but... Yeah, I just don't know for sure."

00:24:43 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Well, ask around and let me know."

00:25:42 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

00:30:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Any input ont he parts situation Shule? I'm still a bit out of the loop these days when it comes to stations."

00:31:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm honestly not sure as I don't know how much of the resources the government gets."

00:31:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "From temp stations that is."

00:32:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It probabyl gets some but, I'm trying to reconsile that with how much they help other folks."

00:32:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er reconcile."

00:32:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I understnad."

00:32:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I got the impression that Melinda would just use other parts to build the stations."

00:32:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Understand. Might talk to Ather and Lily about that as they know more about stations than I do."

00:32:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So AEU orgs would get nothing, not that the stations wouldn't be built at all."

00:33:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, that's what it sounded like."

00:34:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, but I think there's certain parts that get used in soem of that that only we have? That's the main thing I was concerned about there."

00:34:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There's really only one part that the AEU only has access to, I think."

00:35:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And I'm not even sure it's being used on very many stations at the moment."

00:36:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, I'd also talk to Kim too, if you ever see her around."

00:37:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And we might want to talk to Lily about our scooping station."

00:38:30 Not much to see out there.

00:38:32 You glance at your communicator's screen.

00:38:33 There are no notices.

00:39:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We've got two now, a League one in and out of New Earth, and the AEU oen is still doign metals to endymion."

00:42:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
00:42:22 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

00:48:42 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:01:46 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

01:05:45 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

01:09:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Damn orion is chunky."

01:10:21 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I was there yesterday and saw like eleven chunks."

01:10:24 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's... chunky?"

01:10:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "There's like 30 there now, at a rough guess."

01:10:49 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh."

01:10:58 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wow! A bunch must be drifting in or something."

01:12:23 You scramble to your feet.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:14:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:14:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:14:01 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:14:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:14:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:14:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:14:21 Which sector did you mean?

01:14:21 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

01:14:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:14:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:14:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

01:14:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:14:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:14:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:14:31 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: UxUR{"(k\d'wEh4LUQS,*wMH7u9^;U:`Vm'5_Nej
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

01:14:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:14:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:14:36 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:14:36 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

01:14:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:14:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:14:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:14:41 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:14:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

01:14:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:14:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:14:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:14:46 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:14:49 Via general sector communication, League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2522 light-minutes per second from Galactic Eastsoutheast and Very Slightly Down."

01:14:49 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Deadly Strike.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

01:14:50 Starships In Sector:

02:27:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:27:27 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:27:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Seven."

02:27:30 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:27:46 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 283" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:27:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, well, you may be able to find more, but I like to take a break when I start to average more than 40 or so sectors per artifact."

02:27:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:28:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Where are you artifacting out of?"

02:28:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Seve^ Seven seven!"

02:28:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok."

02:28:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm on my way home now."

02:28:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Right, Eli, I'm sorry for what I said earlier, it seems to be working."

02:28:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:28:25 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:28:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:28:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:28:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:28:45 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:28:45 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:15:53 [Starship "Bari Smasher!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a sheet of white paper, an old hefty red soldier felo, and a big red soldier felo here.

03:20:01 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:20:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:20:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:20:06 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:20:07 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I thought you already did."

03:20:33 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I called out Fringe cluster clear, like I usually do on Fringe comms, then I figured I'd save it until I had 'em all checked."

03:20:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's possible it was there before and I didn't notice."

03:20:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:20:39 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:20:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:20:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:20:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:20:54 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:20:55 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:27:42 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:27:43 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:27:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:27:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:27:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:27:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:27:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Do you have a partner, Constantine?"

03:27:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok I'll let you two do this, otherwise, I would have helped you Constantine."

03:28:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:28:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm on my way."

03:28:08 Which sector did you mean?

03:28:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's more pods?"

03:28:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:28:16 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

03:28:25 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:28:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:28:33 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" has jumped into the sector.

03:28:37 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Comet Ray! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:28:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think we'll be good, the flitter cockpit will be crowded with three as it is."

03:28:47 You remove a bulky high-energy plasma explosive from a leather briefcase.

03:28:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Tr org I'm confused about who is doing what."

03:28:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Proceeding to Dock Alpha now."

03:29:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Shule is flying, I'm helping, and Aldis is going to come too and help to see how to do it."

03:29:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:29:11 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:29:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:29:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:29:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Anyway Eli as Shule said I guess there's a pod in Frontier Cluster."

03:29:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:29:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:29:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:29:28 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

03:29:28 You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:29:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "How you doing?"

03:29:39 Hold who?

03:29:57 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

03:29:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok just trying to figure out who is doing what here."

03:29:59 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:30:10 Patriot Constantine Stone switches a flight control scanner off.

03:30:19 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

03:30:23 You say to Patriot Constantine Stone, "Want to drop the bomb this time?"

03:30:29 Patriot Constantine Stone exclaims, "Sure!"

03:30:29 The one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

03:30:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm still over new Earth, trying to dissuade merchants from trading."

03:30:35 Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "What do I do, just tell you as soon as I'm in the airlock?"

03:30:38 I see no "bomb".

03:30:42 The reactionless drive of the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

03:30:43 You give a bulky high-energy plasma explosive to Patriot Constantine Stone.

03:30:46 Aldis Whylita exits from the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray".

03:31:03 You say to Constantine, "Just go two or three roms in, drop the explosive, and run back to the ship."

03:31:06 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

03:31:12 The one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

03:31:14 Aldis Whylita says, "Pleasure to meet you."

03:31:15 You say, "Drop and use the explosive."

03:31:20 You say, "Don't just drop it."

03:31:23 You laugh.

03:31:24 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

03:31:26 Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

03:33:03 You say, "One more."

03:33:11 Aldis Whylita

03:33:11 He appears to be 26 years old. He is about six feet and zero inches tall and has fair skin. His body is slightly muscled with muscled hips and strong calves. He has rounded shoulders and an averagely built chest. His face is oval and somewhat handsome, with a large nose and round chin. His lips are faintly upturned and light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, his eyes are brown and narrow. His short, thick hair is dark red and neatly combed.
 He is wearing a navy blue flight jacket, a navy blue flightsuit with an AEU shoulder patch, a pair of dark red gunnery gloves, and a pair of supple dark brown flight boots. He is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a translucent metachannel FTL communicator, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a standard starship flightbag, and a sturdy silver canvas backpack. His head, face, both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.
He is carrying a frisky hefty red felo in his right hand.

03:33:32 I don't see that here.

03:33:34 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Weapons Room Two]

03:33:34 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a big red soldier felo here.

03:33:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:33:49 You disband your group.

03:33:51 Patriot Constantine Stone removes spacesuit components from a dark orange flightbag with a white lightning bolt on the side and quickly dons them.

03:33:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Bari Smasher!, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:33:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:33:58 The ship is already moving.

03:34:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:34:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:34:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:34:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

03:34:08 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:34:09 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

03:34:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:34:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:34:11 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."

03:34:22 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

03:34:25 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Bari Smasher!! Welcome to home space!"

03:34:25 Aldis Whylita asks, "Should I don my suit as well?"

03:34:29 You say, "Nope."

03:34:33 You say, "Just Constantine."

03:34:34 Aldis Whylita says, "Understood."

03:34:54 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to yellow.

03:35:04 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to red.

03:35:05 You say, "Get ready to drop the felo."

03:35:10 Aldis Whylita nods.

03:35:11 You say, "Net yet."

03:35:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:35:24 Would you like to land at this bari pod?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

03:35:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a bari pod.

03:35:31 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Here we go."

03:35:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off as the ship touches down smoothly inside the bari pod.

03:35:37 A cluster of small, gangly creatures skitter up the wall on spindly legs, and cling in one corner.  They begin to secrete a thick, blackish ooze from glands behind their mouths, which they quickly fashion into a fast-drying nest.
An incubation sack on a bari hive bursts open, and several larval bari fall from it.

03:35:41 You put down an obese golden soldier felo.

03:35:42 You put down a large red soldier felo.

03:35:43 Aldis Whylita puts down a frisky hefty red felo.

03:36:26 Would you like to land at this bari pod?

03:36:26 [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:36:26 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to green.

03:36:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a bari pod.

03:36:34 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off. Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received. Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection."

03:36:34 You suddenly float up into the air as the ship's artificial gravity abruptly switches off, and you feel your hair stand on end as the ship projects an electromagnetic field around you. Suddenly, every seam of the ship seems to come apart, exposing you to space. You quickly close your eyes as the vacuum pulls at your skin and the electromagnetic field tugs you rapidly toward a starship rescue pod.
[Bari Smasher! Rescue Pod]
You can go nowhere.
The pod simply drifts for a moment as its automatic navigation systems come online. Then it smoothly maneuvers through the wreckage of the starship and out into open space.

03:36:36 The flight computer is locked to autopilot mode and seems to have no controls whatsoever.

03:36:40 You say, "Sorry."

03:36:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:36:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:36:46 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:36:49 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:36:49 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

03:36:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:36:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:36:52 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:36:53 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:36:54 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:36:55 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

03:36:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:36:57 Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "Ah, what happened?"

03:36:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:36:58 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:36:58 The ship rapidly heads toward a planet.

03:36:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:37:00 Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "Is everyone okay?"

03:37:08 You exclaim, "So sorry guys!"

03:37:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.
Rescue workers quickly empty the landed rescue pod.

03:37:11 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

03:37:11 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

03:37:22 You say, "My fault."

03:37:25 Tara Flores walks in from a transparisteel doorway into the pilot lounge.

03:37:28 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "We couldn't get away fast enough."

03:37:29 Patriot Constantine Stone waves to Tara Flores.

03:37:30 You say, "Yeah."

03:37:36 Aldis Whylita says, "I was in your way, Shule. My bad."

03:37:36 Tara Flores exclaims, "Oh! What happened?!"

03:50:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Guys, check out the shoping channel. Theres something real weird on it."

03:50:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "There we go."

03:50:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:50:45 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:50:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:50:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:51:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:51:00 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:51:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:51:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I am going to need a bigger ship before I even think about that."

03:52:41 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

03:52:46 You glance at your communicator's screen.

03:52:46 A new episode of Panoramic Forest Adventure has been released to pilots. [01:52 23 August 2317 GST]

03:53:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Lily? Are you replacing your ship? And do you need me to help you bring it over to the Torus?"

03:53:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Guess what folks? It's moss!"

03:54:04 You slide a "Bari Smasher!" key off of a keychain.

03:54:05 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm sure it's a different breed."

03:54:09 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "A new episode of the Moss Channel is always something to be excited about."

03:54:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:54:13 You slide a "Bari Smasher!" key onto a keychain.

03:54:28 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "What channel is that again?"

03:54:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "WMOS."

03:54:35 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "WMOS."

03:54:49 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

03:55:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wow a new episode, exciting."

03:55:36 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yeah, they have a stump and everything."

03:55:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Guess what? It's...it's MOSS!"

03:55:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww man, why'd you ruin it."

03:55:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:56:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:56:32 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.

03:57:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...what was that Eli?"

03:57:58 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That catbot commercial. It always sounds like they're saying catbutt to me."

03:58:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh."

03:58:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

03:58:13 Not much to see out there.

03:58:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ugh the Recharging station in 777 will be going down in almost 13 hours."

03:59:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What the hell is that.."

03:59:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I can take care of it, but note that Melinda has floated the idea of not including AEU orgs on any stations."

03:59:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I don't know how that will factor into our plans."

03:59:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its some animal made out of wall paper and screws?"

03:59:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not as some kind of middle finger raised to us, mind you, but as a way to deny best tax money."

03:59:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least I think that was her intent."

04:00:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That will hurt a lot."

04:00:59 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Alright. I'm gonna hit the hay, folks. Y'all rest well when ya do."

04:01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I'm honestly interested in it."

04:01:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "Oh. Maybe."

04:02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They're cool."

04:02:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We derive our income from others work and we gain command from their work. This is why I don't like discouraging others to do business with us because we are hurting other Alliances now, not just the AEU Government."

04:02:17 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Embracing your inner bovine?"

04:02:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. Goin to bed."

04:02:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Right then."

04:02:49 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

04:03:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We don't earn a lot from 777 but if she does this, then we'll also put up a Xenology Station in Mir or in 777."

04:05:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What we do in 777 has nothing to do with Melinda. Cats doesn't contribute anything to 777 as you know."

04:05:20 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Hey so why is the Fringe interfering in the AEU strike?"

04:06:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, just wanted to point it out. I'll build the stations as planned if you want me to keep doing it."

04:07:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Of course! 777 is only with Libs and Nicolette's org and an occasional other smaller org. It has nothing to do with Melinda."

04:07:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And we just need to tell Melinda that we still want to be in on stations."

04:07:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The orgs are listed."

04:07:37 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Anybody know?"

04:07:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We do but if she says AEU is out, then that's her call I suppose."

04:08:04 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The news twisted it."

04:08:07 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Slighty."

04:08:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's not really how it happened. Basically a Fringe ilot told one of our newer ones that it was ok to work, because they knew that under the original rules of the strike we weren't putting pressure on the newer pilots."

04:08:13 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin coughs. "Slightly."

04:08:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "She said until she was notified otherwise."

04:08:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh."

04:08:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "She was just waiting for us to say whether or not we wanted to remain included."

04:08:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oops sorry mis-communication. I'm trying to fly and htings."

04:09:02 You scramble to your feet.

04:09:15 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

04:09:15 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

04:09:16 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:09:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:09:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:09:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:09:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:09:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:09:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, it was just someone trying to be helpful to a newer pilot."

04:09:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Hyperion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:09:41 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:09:42 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

04:09:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:09:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:09:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:09:48 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

04:21:19 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Trading at AEu ports help plans that endanger lives and humanity as a whole."

04:21:34 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Trading at AEu ports help plans that endanger lives and humanity as a whole."

04:22:03 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 238" has landed on the planet New Earth.

04:23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I encourage all of you to graba scanner and try to convince merchants not to trade. The more of us that do it the better."

04:23:56 Direct a transmission at who? No ship matching "merchant" found.

04:24:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'd suggest not trying to stop merchants that are moving goods like food or water."

04:24:37 Direct a transmission at who? No ship matching "merchant" found.

04:24:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just say things like "funing Best is bad for humanity. Stop Outccord today, and things like that."

04:24:52 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

04:25:10 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 238" has launched from New Earth.

04:25:20 Via general sector communication, this ship directs a text-based transmission at Registered Merchant 238: "Stop trading at AEU ports and stop OutAccord today."

04:25:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We barely have time to see what they are carrying, but merchants carrying things like food or water will likely know better than to quit."

04:25:29 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 238" has jumped out of the sector.

04:25:39 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "No need to starve the people of New Earth and make them hate civilian pilots even more than they already do."

04:25:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though I'll try to keep an eye out for that."

04:26:02 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Okay, I won't."

04:26:09 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I don't think I could anyway."

04:26:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So far I've mostly seem carrying books and metals."

04:27:07 Direct a transmission at who? No ship matching "merchant" found.

04:27:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok good idea when coming back from taking the transport out some where is to stop off at Providence for a full recharge. As you know, Accord only provides a very slow trickle charge and the ship has to be powered up for that to be effective."

04:27:50 Which sector did you mean?

04:27:50 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

04:27:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:27:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:27:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:27:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

04:27:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:27:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:27:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:27:58 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:27:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:28:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:28:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:28:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:28:04 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:28:06 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:28:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Was going to try adn check the trading center on Hoyt to see what they were selling, but I forgot I can't get out there in a capsule."

04:28:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."

04:28:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:28:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Was going to try adn check the trading center on Hoyt to see what they were selling, but I forgot I can't get out there in a capsule."

04:28:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:28:54 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:28:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The Recharging station for 777 is ready to go."

04:28:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:28:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:29:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:29:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, thanks."

04:29:12 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Thanks for keeping us informed."

04:29:14 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:29:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I've seen a few merchants moving water around, is why I said that, and its more we need to think carefully how we approach the trading stuff. We don't want to cause unintended conceuqences."

04:29:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:29:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:30:16 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

04:42:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know Eli won't like it but I am not going to just roll over and die here."

04:42:23 You nod.

04:42:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is our problem, we're becoming even more hard core separatists and I am not for tht."

07:16:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Human skinned felo... oh lordy."

07:16:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well the message is as relevant as ever. But let's see where he goes next."

07:24:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Poor poor man. I contribued six percent to our alliance."

07:24:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "That's like... just a tiny tiny bit."

07:26:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Very nice constantine."

07:30:31 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You should definitely do it."

07:30:44 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "With little human feet."

07:30:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A free baby?"

07:32:00 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Apparently Doc's tonic mixes your genetic material with the felo during application."

07:32:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Interesting."

07:32:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It does indeed appear this way."

07:33:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Like...This felo has the same eyes. skin. and nails as me."

07:33:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And the felo doesn't suddenly seem like it wants to die or anything, right?"

07:33:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It does not? Damn. Ouch. Eli."

07:33:57 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

07:34:07 [General Communication] "That wasn't directed at you specifically, I just mean in general." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "From beign altered like that."

07:34:08 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Are you insulting my genetics?"

07:34:08 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It is sleeping."

07:34:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like I know if I went from having human feet to felo feet, that would really throw me off a bit."

07:35:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Only asking because I wouldn't want to give it to a felo and then it never stop looking at me with pure hatred or something like that."

07:35:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It just rubbed it's head against my hand, so I think we're good."

07:36:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok. Well then personalized human felo pets for all then."

07:36:18 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Better than rubbing its human hand against your head."

07:36:38 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It may get there."

07:37:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wonder, if you give it to a hummer would it just start having regular covnersations with you?"

07:37:58 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you wanna find that out. Go ahead. But if a felo ever starts talking to me. I'm running."

07:38:45 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What if its first words are, "What, you still don't know how to replace your arms with tentacles? Here, let me show you.""

07:38:57 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they've been trying to tell you this whole time."

07:41:18 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "New theory."

07:41:51 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Doc got genetic material from Evenia during meeting. All the felo will look like her."

07:56:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So if I drink the tonic, will I turn into a felo man?"

07:56:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, it seems legit, right?"

07:56:38 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No. It has Evenia's genetic material in it."

07:56:41 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That or an Evenili."

07:56:43 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "From what we can tell."

07:58:01 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So then a felo would have to feed it to me."

07:58:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

07:58:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This sounds like some potent stuff, for sure."

08:09:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright Eli, it's looking pretty quiet. I'm going to hit the rack."

08:09:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll get back to it when I wake up."

08:10:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right on, sounds good."

08:10:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll keep an eye out while I'm still awake."

08:13:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Did so- oh right, Lily exploded earlier."

08:13:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What?"

08:14:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I have a report on credits losses regarding a civvie ship destruction, I forgot that that hauler exploded when they cleared the pod."

08:14:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah. It was Shule, Aldis, and I."

08:17:21 [MTTS] Ulias: Fantastic.

08:26:58 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

08:35:39 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "After the conversation I've just had, which yielded zero results, I'm scared to ask but what's going on with Eve and felo?"

08:37:28 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It would seem that Doc managed to get genetic material from her during meeting. Doc's formula alters felo and gives them human skin, eyes, and feet... that all match Evenia's."

08:37:33 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I call then Evelo."

08:37:42 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,086,176.87 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

08:37:44 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Eh.. oh goodness."

08:38:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You guys sure it's not just whoever has petted the felo the most recently or the most or something like that?"

08:38:37 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I find this even more concerning."

08:38:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was under the impression that the Doc didn't actually take any samples from her."

08:39:00 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Well, Nicolette gave one tonic and it looked like Evenia."

08:39:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Super fast trip to 777. Only 15 minutes in the rift."

08:39:12 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "All you need is strand of hair."

08:39:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes..."

08:39:33 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "People leave genetic material all over the place without realizing. Or realizing."

08:40:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But if it was her felo and she gave it the tonic, it may not mean that they'll all turn out that way?"

08:40:44 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Eh."

08:40:49 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I like my theory."

08:40:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I suppose odder things have happened, but if he specifically made a tonic to make them like her specifically that would be like way up there on the list."

08:41:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

08:41:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, it's not a bad theory."

08:41:21 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Didn't she recently have her arms replaced?"

08:41:27 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "At least they're not from the future."

08:41:39 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No, just met with Doc and got stuff to do it apparently."

08:41:49 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I mean, hopefully do it?"

08:41:59 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yeah, I doubt even genetics could make sandwiches from the future look like a pilot."

08:42:00 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It is sort of unpredictable."

08:42:39 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "She might grow tiny noses on her finger tips or something. That would be a thing."

08:43:55 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Anyway. Time for sleep. Pleasant dreams of human-skinned felo with human feet. Wonderful."

08:44:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

08:44:30 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Good sleep, Aisling."

16:02:03 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

16:02:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:02:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:02:36 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:02:41 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

16:02:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:02:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:02:53 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:02:54 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One of the EMMs is emitting a steady hum, indicating that it should be replaced. A ramp leads up to the rest of the station.

17:49:02 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, the Accord negotiations continue, and so does our strike. The liaison office has informed me that the negotations are still on schedule to end during the first week of September. That means we have two more weeks at most to really show our displeasure and get the citizens of the Union talking. The strike remains voluntary, but I strongly encourage everyone to take part. If you're looking for something to do, grab a flight scanner and head into orbit and watch for trade ships entering our sectors. Try to reason with them and ask them not to make trades in our space.

19:56:26 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

19:56:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:14:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:14:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:14:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:14:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:14:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:14:09 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Endymion Orbit flight control, this is Endymion, we record an outbound AEU destroyer."

20:14:10 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in Providence Station, we detect an AEU destroyer inbound."
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:14:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

20:14:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:14:12 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

20:14:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:14:15 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Providence Station here, we record an outbound AEU destroyer."

20:14:15 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Space Station Alpha flight control here, we record an inbound AEU destroyer."
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:14:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

20:14:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

20:14:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:15:03 Via general sector communication, Comet Ray transmits a text-based transmission: "I didn't know, so I was keeping an eye out."

20:15:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:15:07 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:15:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:15:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in New Earth, AEU destroyer incoming."

20:15:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:15:27 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:15:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No problem, Aldis and we appreciate it."

20:15:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:15:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:15:39 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

20:15:39 You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:15:39 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The four-person mule "Lion's Den" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

20:15:41 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

20:15:41 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.

20:15:41 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

20:15:42 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

20:15:42 You can go north, east, south, and west.

20:15:42 You rapidly enter a few numbers into a keypad next to the door.

20:15:42 You open the door.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.
You can go east.

20:15:43 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth here, AEU flitter heading for us."

20:15:46 I don't understand that.

20:15:48 You close the door.

20:15:53 You switch a flight control scanner off.

20:15:55 You sit down on an ergonomically designed silver leather and mesh chair.

20:15:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I'm just doing my part."

20:16:10 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:17:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Definitely. It looks like we did get one merchant ship to abandon its route."

20:17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "The water merchant. Always good to know!"

20:18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah, a different one. One that was carrying luxury foods."

20:18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Ah, even better, then."

20:22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think there's any way we can raise the stakes somehow?"

20:23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm just spitballing here, but is there a way we can get the other alliances to agree to stop trading with us if we leave the Accord?"

20:23:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or would that be too dangerous."

20:23:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And maybe remove our ports from their courier delivery networks."

20:23:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As a way to entice Best to stay in the Accord."

20:23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe these things are already on the table being negotiated."

20:24:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If they would do something like that, it might be helpfull, but we can't really make them care enough to do that."

20:24:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I suggested they stop doing courier runs while this is going on to deny our ports goods, but Morris said they couldn't as it would hurt everyone."

20:24:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was told that several pilots have agreed to stop using Union ports in their trade runs. Civilian pilots I mean. So at least that will help."

20:24:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If we could even get them on board for two weeks."

20:25:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Perhaps later this evening I will poll everyone and ask if they think this is an option we should pursue."

20:25:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Getting the other Alliances to threaten cutting off trade if we pull out, that is."

20:26:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not sure how much actual trading the other civilian pilots do."

20:26:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or trading runs, that is."

20:26:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean getting the alliances themselves to agree to limit their registered merchants."

20:27:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you do that, don't use the voting machine for it."

20:27:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So like if we left the accord, League registered merchants would stop running goods to our ports entirely."

20:27:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If that's even possible."

20:27:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I'm not sure as they may choose their own trading runs, just like we canl."

20:28:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well we can't trade in Mutuality ports, can we?"

20:28:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So there must be a way to enforce such a restriction."

20:28:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or is that entirely related to our relations with the Mutuality?"

20:28:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hmm, I'm not sure. I've never really tried to do trading runs to the Mutuality."

20:29:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Even if they could just suggest it, it might help. If they force the issue it might cause a whole other set of problems."

20:29:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think Ather said we couldn't and Dakhal found that we couldn't when he tried."

20:29:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed, if we did leave the Accord it would blow up in our face majorly."

20:29:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah."

20:29:32 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Missions or beacons. Cruiser preferable."

20:29:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah we can't trade over there, that's because of us having no diplomatic relations."

20:29:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Precisely."

20:30:01 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I could do any."

20:30:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Has there been any talk of the other Alliances dissolving diplomatic relations with us in the event that we leave the Accord?"

20:30:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, not that I'm aware."

20:30:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This wouldn't surprise me, but I haven't heard anything about it yet."

20:30:25 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo."

20:30:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But folks don't always share that kind of info."

20:30:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder why they're not threatening that? It seems like it would be the easiest muscle for them to flex."

20:30:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they just don't care."

20:30:48 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Hi Rogue."

20:30:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Constantine and Eli, can I have a word with you two in private?"

20:30:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Certainly."

20:30:57 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chirps quietly as it receives a new notice.

20:31:02 You glance at your communicator's screen.

20:31:03 You have one mail message.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi Rogue, and everyone else."

20:31:07 You scramble to your feet.

20:31:07 You briefly open the door to leave.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

20:31:08 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

20:31:08 You can go north, east, south, and west.

20:31:08 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

20:31:08 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.

20:31:09 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

20:31:09 The four-person mule "Lion's Den" and the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 381" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

20:31:27 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Rogue missions or beacons?"

20:31:28 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 381" rises smoothly off the ground and accelerates rapidly toward space.

20:31:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They don't care very much. They would care more if their pilots did, but most of them seem content to sit back and think it's not their problem."

20:31:51 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Ted are you up for any?"

20:31:51 The one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I'll be right over Shule."

20:31:59 Patriot Constantine Stone exits from the four-person mule "Lion's Den".

20:32:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm a bit far away right now."

20:32:02 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Coffee and smoke. So not now."

20:32:03 Patriot Constantine Stone waves.

20:32:06 You wave to Patriot Constantine Stone.

20:32:30 The four-person mule "Lion's Den" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

20:32:34 The one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" rises smoothly off the ground and accelerates rapidly toward space.

20:35:12 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

20:35:15 You say, "Just waiting for Eli."

20:35:17 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:35:22 The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" touches down smoothly on the ground.

20:35:28 The reactionless drive of the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

20:35:28 You hold Patriot Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

20:35:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey exits from the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul".

20:35:31 You hold Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's hand, taking him into your group.

20:35:33 You wave to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

20:35:35 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.

20:35:35 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:35:37 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:35:37 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

20:35:40 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:35:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:35:41 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:35:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:35:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:35:50 You say, "Sec."

20:35:54 The ship is already moving.

20:35:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:35:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Dusty Reaches. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:35:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:35:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey arches an eyebrow.

20:35:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

20:36:00 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 381" has jumped into the sector.

20:36:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:36:03 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 381! Welcome to home space!"

20:36:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:36:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:36:05 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

20:36:07 Via general sector communication, Beacon C-09 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Dusty Reaches."

20:36:09 AutoStar detects 25 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

20:36:14 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Beacon C-09.

20:36:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:36:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:36:33 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

20:36:37 Automated flight control clears the ship to dock.

20:36:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:36:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

20:36:41 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.

20:36:43 You may not leave the starship while it is moving.

20:36:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:36:48 You exit the ship.

20:36:48 [Beacon C-09; Docking Bay]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see a sanitation drone here.
You can go up and down.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.

20:36:50 [Beacon C-09; Systems Room]

20:36:50 You can go up and down.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.

20:37:06 You say, "Ok, sorry. I don't think what I'm about to say would do well over comms."

20:37:09 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

20:37:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:37:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ok."

20:37:13 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:37:14 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

20:37:22 Patriot Constantine Stone glances at a sanitation drone.

20:37:31 Eli says to Constantine, "It's fine, this is an Accord beacon."

20:37:33 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:37:45 Eli says to a sanitation drone, "But shoo anyways."

20:38:00 You say, "The problem with having the other alliances dissolve diplomatic relations with us, is that is exactly what Best wants."

20:38:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you.

20:38:09 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods up.

20:38:10 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Ah, good point."

20:38:12 You say, "Er, Best."

20:38:17 Patriot Constantine Stone removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a dark orange flightbag with a white lightning bolt on the side.

20:38:19 Patriot Constantine Stone asks, "Sorry, say again?"

20:38:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah, that's what he's going for, for sure."

20:38:41 You say to Constantine, "Just that Best wants the AEu to stand alone."

20:38:53 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I wonder if there's some way we can get the other Alliances to agree to keep us out of their trade and courier networks, but not dissolve their non-aggression agreements."

20:39:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I wouldn't want anyone to dissovle relations with us. Any affirming comment I made was directed towards perhaps asking them to suggest to their merchants not to trade. But ultimately I think that is up to whatever merchant guild type thing that their may be."

20:39:34 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Asking that might be too risky even if it were possible, though. If we did leave the Accord, we wouldn't actually want trade or deliveries to stop."

20:39:35 You say, "So, we have to find a way to put pressure on the government but still show that we want diplomatic relations with the other alliances."

20:39:48 You nod to Patriot Constantine Stone.

20:39:58 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "I know."

20:40:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Melinda has offered to stop using AEU parts on stations, I think that will help if we can get Lily and Ather on board, though I'm nto sure if current stations will run out in time."

20:40:39 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't Lily will agree to that."

20:40:53 You say, "Lily won't agree to it."

20:41:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

20:41:16 You say, "She threw a hissy fit when she heard about it."

20:41:20 You chuckle.

20:41:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "For oen thing, doign what we're already doign will help with the merchant situation. Doubtless the news is already spreading a bit."

20:41:32 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

20:41:32 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "That's true."

20:41:45 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I just wish we could better signal to Best what the consequences for pulling out would be."

20:42:15 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It also won't hurt to toss it out on general every once and a while, for merchants that may be on other routes but are coming this way later and so on."

20:42:20 You nod. "I agree, but how without hurting our relations with the other alliances."

20:42:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I was doing that a bit yesterday."

20:42:26 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

20:42:26 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:42:44 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I was just thinking, what if we only responded to sector alerts in, say, Fringe space, and got the Fringe to respond to our own."

20:42:52 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Signaling that we'll only work together to defend ourselves."

20:42:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:43:01 You say, "Hmm."

20:43:03 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But sector alerts are rare and random."

20:43:03 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

20:43:12 You nod.

20:43:12 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I don't know if that would even be effective over the next two weeks."

20:43:19 You say, "Probably not."

20:44:11 You say, "Anway, whatever we do, I think we should do everything we can to show we need the other alliances and they need us."

20:44:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "And we're sure that everyone is striking right? Like mostly everyone anyways?"

20:44:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I know Dakhal's not."

20:44:39 You say, "As far as I know, yeah."

20:44:40 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "As far as I know, it's just Dakhal who is openly against it."

20:44:47 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Okinaj may or may not be, I'm not sure."

20:44:50 You say, "Lily doesn't need to work."

20:44:55 You chuckle.

20:44:59 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Everyone else either hasn't said anything about it or doesn't work anyway."

20:45:03 You nod.

20:45:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Privately he's not though. He said it plainly in his offices, knoing that they might be bugged."

20:45:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Also said he would let us know if anyone was violatig the strike."

20:45:27 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Er violating."

20:45:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey shrugs.

20:45:39 You say, "Oh, I didn't know."

20:45:47 You say, "That's good then."

20:45:48 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I guess it's better than nothing."

20:45:50 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But only just."

20:46:03 "Yeah, he's on our side but his principles won't let him strike while he's the Whip." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "At least that's the jist of it."

20:46:07 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "No one is going to think less of him as a whip or as a pilot if he strikes."

20:46:17 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "But we can't make him."

20:46:17 You say, "Lily even called off clearing the vents because of the strike."

20:46:19 Eli says to Constantine, "He will, I think that's the main problem."

20:46:23 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:46:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Good."

20:46:32 You nod.

20:46:37 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Maybe he should resign his office."

20:46:48 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "We definitely don't need a whip right now."

20:47:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I know there's some concern about bari, but the processor has always been under control as far as spreaders and stuff."

20:47:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Clearing the vents just gives us access."

20:47:14 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "If he did that, I guarantee we would all vote for him next term, or in a special election to reinstate him once the strike ends."

20:47:15 You say, "Actually, it's a good way for us to know if someone is violating the strike."

20:47:21 You say, "Having a whip."

20:47:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you.

20:47:29 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I guess."

20:47:37 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Right now it seems like that's just him, though."

20:47:40 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "So."

20:47:42 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I don't think they would remove him if he were to striek though."

20:47:46 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Er strike."

20:47:51 You say, "Nah, I don't think so either."

20:47:54 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "They definitely wouldn't."

20:47:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "They haven't removed any of you guys, right?"

20:47:59 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think he would have to resign."

20:48:01 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Nope."

20:48:03 You say, "They haven't removed either of us."

20:48:04 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "They're not going to."

20:48:12 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I'm a known patriot, famous for valiantly rejecting the strike."

20:48:21 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Vernos complained about them all day and they did nothing to him."

20:48:29 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "They don't lash out at their cultivated propaganda pieces."

20:48:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

20:48:35 You nod.

20:48:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Right, if they start rogueing everyone and stuff, it'l just make them look bad, not us."

20:48:48 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:48:51 You say, "Exactly."

20:49:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ather thinks I should do another broadcast, tonight if possible. I wasnt' sure one was necessary at this poitn though."

20:49:26 You say, "Anyways, thanks for the chat. There are merchant ships to talk to."

20:49:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you.

20:49:36 Patriot Constantine Stone says, "I think it could be good."

20:49:38 [Beacon C-09; Docking Bay]

20:49:39 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You can go up and down.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.

20:49:43 Board what?

20:49:46 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

20:49:46 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:49:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:49:47 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Patriot Constantine Stone and Rogue Pilot Eli Grey followed you.

20:49:48 You begin the launch sequence.

20:49:53 The computer locates a launch trajectory.

20:49:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Maybe get the word out to merchants who haven't been working the past two days."

20:50:00 You nod. "For sure."

20:50:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Problem is, finding time to throw something together."

20:50:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:50:04 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

20:50:05 Patriot Constantine Stone nods.

20:50:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:50:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:50:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:50:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:50:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:50:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:50:13 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:50:14 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

20:50:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:50:16 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

20:50:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:50:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:50:18 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:50:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:51:04 You say, "Thanks guys."

20:51:06 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

20:51:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:51:08 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

23:46:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:46:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
