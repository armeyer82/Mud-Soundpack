01:04:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:04:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "You'd think he would be here, but he hasn't said whether he would make it one way or another."

01:04:39 Constantine Stone says, "I reckon he isn't coming."

01:04:42 Constantine Stone says, "We shouldn't wait."

01:04:43 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I believe this might it."

01:04:47 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Er might be it."

01:04:53 Andrew scratches his head, then nods.

01:05:16 Lily says to Andrew, "Your time is valuable so if he planned to make a showing... He should have arrived timely."

01:05:22 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa opens the door.

01:05:22 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa strides in from the south.

01:05:27 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa closes the door.

01:05:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh! I guess we were wrong, there is another."

01:05:32 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:05:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:05:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a sip of a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.

01:05:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves and smiles at Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:05:40 You nod to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:05:46 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "All right then. Th' purpose o' this here meetin' is ta discuss what happened at thet there skim gate whatsit negotiation meetin'."

01:05:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

01:06:02 An unnamed man in a suit marks something down on his clipboard.

01:06:16 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Was any o' you in perticular th' spokesperson fer this meetin'?"

01:06:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

01:06:53 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa switches a toggle on his black flip einrophone.

01:06:55 You say, "Quite simply, we were unprepared and had really nothing to offer the council."

01:07:00 You frown.

01:08:39 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa asks, "Isn't the underlying issue the fact that they want to ensure somehow that the AEU doesn't attack them or something?"

01:08:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:08:49 You nod to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:09:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is what the takaway was."

01:09:35 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Well.... thet would be a non-aggression pact, whereas this discussion was fer gate access, 'less Ah missed somethin'."

01:09:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I will take some responsibility in that they were unprepared, as well. There was some miscummincation between me and the Mutuality liaison. The folks who were sent were given barely a day's notice because of that."

01:10:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "True but wouldn't there be other provisions? I really don't even know what the terms of the QSA agreement were."

01:10:14 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "So why can't the government issue this promise? You leave us alone, we'll leave you alone. No attacks without provication."

01:10:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:10:49 You nod to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:11:18 Eli nods in agreement.

01:11:59 You say to Andrew, "You are right, but one of their concerns is that if us civilian pilots were to be allowed through the skims, then the navy would also have access."

01:12:01 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa asks, "Granted, the Mutuality hesitates to trust any major planetary government, but what are we going to lose if we issue a promise of doing what we're already doing?"

01:12:19 Lily nods solumnly.

01:12:36 Constantine Stone says, "I think that tensions have risen since the course correction that put AEU navy ships in Mutuality space."

01:12:43 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Thet's problematic what with all th' pirates and th' warnin' us not to do nothin'. Y'all had yer own opportunities to negotiate such a thing in th' intervenin' years as well, if'n y'all recall."

01:12:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes this is precisely what they were concerned about."

01:13:00 An unnamed man in a suit says, "Hem. Hem. That is not the topic of this meeting."

01:13:17 Constantine Stone says, "Well we can negotiate non-aggression betwen the pilot corps and the Mutuality."

01:13:23 Constantine Stone says, "But I think they're concerned about the AEU navy."

01:13:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Constantine Stone.

01:13:54 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Right, well, movin' on ta why we're here."

01:14:15 Ather turns his gaze to the suited man and asks, "who is this guy, and why is he at a meeting of civilian pilots?"

01:14:16 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Can anyone at th' meetin' sum up what went on, what was said, and suchlike?"

01:14:58 Lily says to an unnamed man in a suit, "Yes sir please introduce yourself and since this is a meeting of confidence, we would appreciate knowing who you are."

01:15:15 An unnamed man in a suit says, "I am merely an observer, please pretend I am not here."

01:15:31 Constantine says to an unnamed man in a suit, "Do you work in the liaison office?"

01:15:48 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "It'd be easier to pretend you're not here if you left, pal!"

01:15:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

01:16:03 An unnamed man in a suit begins writing on the clipboard again.

01:16:03 Constantine says to an unnamed man in a suit, "Or are you here representing the president?"

01:17:14 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "If someone was here representing the president, there is no reason he should hesitate in saying so, while offerring proof. As for the liaison office, their rep is here already!"

01:17:17 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa points at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:17:20 An unnamed man in a suit says to Andrew, "Not that I am telling you how to do your job, but perhaps you could bring this meeting to order."

01:17:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

01:17:48 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Yes, let's focus on th' reason we're here."

01:17:49 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa glares.

01:18:00 An unnamed man in a suit writes something else down on the clipboard.

01:18:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Again this is a confidential meeting and we'd appreciate your identifying yourself properly sir."

01:18:34 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Can somebody tell me what happened at th' skim gate meetin'?"

01:19:10 Ather keeps his mechanical gaze fixed firmly on the suited man, but sits back in his chair.

01:19:40 Eli calmly sips from a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.

01:21:03 Lily gazes out of the window.

01:21:52 You say to Andrew, "Basically, Lily, Evangeline, and myself showed up to the meeting. We waited for them to take the lead, but it became clear that we were supposed to present an offer. When we offered not to attack them, they asked us for proof of how we could ensure the AEU would not attack them. Then we went back and forth with them asking us to give them an offer we could uphold and guarantee and a plan of how we would ensure the agreement would be upheld."

01:22:04 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Might as well just say it. This weirdo probably already heard everything on comms anyway if he or one of his people monitor."

01:22:46 Ather turns briefly to nod at shule before fixing his gaze on the suited man again.

01:22:59 An unnamed man in a suit adds something to the clipboard notes.

01:23:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

01:23:20 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Were ya... were ya not aware this was a meetin' y'all requested?"

01:23:36 Shule glances over at an unnamed man in a suit suspiciously before turning his attention back to Andrew.

01:24:08 Lily says to Andrew, "Not really as our current... ahem representative doesn't communicate very effectively to us."

01:24:33 An unnamed man in a suit glances up at Andrew Lambeth at that remark.

01:24:40 You say to Andrew, "I was not aware who requested the meeting. Just that a meeting was called for."

01:25:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs. "She was referring to our Voice, Vernos Daily, not Mister Lambeth."

01:25:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The individual I'm referring to is Vernos Bailey."

01:25:21 An unnamed man in a suit says, "Hem. Hem."

01:25:24 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

01:25:27 An unnamed man in a suit writes more on the clipboard.

01:26:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Anyway onto the topic at hand?"

01:26:30 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Ah see. Well then. What offers were made at th' time?"

01:26:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Right Mr Lambeth has always done well by us."

01:27:37 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth smiles. "Why thank ya."

01:27:45 Shule ponders for a moment and then says, "An offer for the civilian pilots not to attack the Mutuality, an offer to provide the mutuality with medial supplies...

01:27:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods and smiles at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:27:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smiles and nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:27:55 You say, "Medical."

01:28:05 You smile and nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:28:38 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Was attackin' 'em on th' table then?"

01:28:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes sir."

01:28:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is what they kept emphasizing."

01:29:02 Constantine Stone says, "I think he's asking if we ever planned to attack them."

01:29:03 You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:29:05 Constantine Stone says, "Which of course we didn't."

01:29:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They did not ask for anything additional beyond this request."

01:29:15 You say, "Oh, no in that case no."

01:29:19 Constantine Stone says, "I think they were so concerned about these assurances because of the fleet encroaching on their space."

01:29:26 You nod to Constantine Stone.

01:29:27 Constantine Stone says, "That's why it was 'on the table,' so to speak."

01:29:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:29:42 You say to Constantine, "Precisely."

01:29:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They asked us how we would convey this request."

01:30:18 You say, "And how we could assure that the AEU would not attack them."

01:30:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

01:30:55 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "An' what was yer answer?"

01:32:49 You say, "We responded that we would do anything and everything to convey this request to our government. However, they asked for specific details which we did not give them."

01:33:17 An unnamed man in a suit writes something else on the clipboard.

01:33:36 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "An' Ah can surmise they wasn't interested in th' medical stuff neither."

01:33:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs.

01:34:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They simply responded that they had sufficient and did not live in huts or something similar to that."

01:34:15 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:34:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey arches an eyebrow.

01:34:30 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "They get all that stuff probably from the league. I doubt they need any of that stuff."

01:34:32 Andrew nods thoughtfully. "Thet's true. No huts."

01:34:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They are indeed a proud lot."

01:35:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey removes a metallic silver touch einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

01:35:24 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Was them's th' only offers made? Any counteroffers from 'em?"

01:35:25 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey puts a metallic silver touch einrophone in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

01:35:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.

01:36:24 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "An' how did th' meeting come to a close?"

01:36:47 You say to Andrew, "They refused to make any counter offers."

01:36:56 You say, "They wanted us to make the offer."

01:37:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

01:37:46 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Makes a sorta sense. Ya don't call somebody on th' phone then ask 'em what they want when they answer."

01:37:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs.

01:37:58 Andrew then adds, "Helpful when negotiations are two way though."

01:38:05 You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:38:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'most definitely."

01:38:15 An unnamed man in a suit glances briefly at Andrew Lambeth, then notes something down on the clipboard.

01:38:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "It wouldnt have hurt for them to make a suggestions, but yes, we are the ones requesting access."

01:38:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They were very annoyed that the aEU didn't make a showing when the QSA agreement was due."

01:38:48 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

01:38:58 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth nods.

01:38:59 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "It could theoretically also mean that no matter what we offer they won't return QSA access regardless due to current tensions."

01:39:20 You nod to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "This very well may have been the case."

01:39:47 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Oh, Ah reckon there's somethin' you coulda offered 'em they would take, but probably nothin' wise."

01:39:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well they probably may provided the aEU Government will commit to and state that they will not attack under non-hostile conditions."

01:40:16 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, my understanding is that this is the only 'offer' they'll accept."

01:40:19 Constantine Stone says, "Though I wasn't present."

01:40:22 An unnamed man in a suit adds more to the clipboard notes.

01:40:30 Lily says to Constantine, "This is correct."

01:40:37 I don't understand that.

01:40:42 I don't understand that.

01:40:45 I don't understand that.

01:40:54 You nod to Constantine Stone.

01:41:00 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Attackin' would tend ta make conditions hostile. But Ah see yer point. Ah think."

01:41:10 Constantine says to you, "Did you get the sense that what we say is really immaterial? What they want is an assurance that the encroachment was a mistake and won't happen again."

01:41:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well we almost made it hostile."

01:41:22 You nod to Constantine Stone. "I did."

01:41:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Tht Flotilla had no business doing wht they did."

01:41:46 Constantine Stone says, "Does it seems that this is then out of our hands as civilian pilots? If the government needs to do something interesting on the border of Mutuality space, that's up to them, and we can't stop them."

01:41:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That Flotilla had no business doing what they did."

01:41:53 Constantine Stone says, "But if they don't, they're raising tensions for no reason."

01:42:00 Constantine Stone says, "And should issue such an assurance."

01:42:00 Andrew hurriedly asks, "Is there anythin' else of note thet happened durin' th' meetin'?"

01:42:06 Constantine Stone says, "In this pilot's opinion, anyhow."

01:42:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

01:42:18 An unnamed man in a suit writes more on the clipboard.

01:42:20 You say to Andrew, "I don't believe so."

01:42:23 Lily looks in the direction of shule.

01:42:55 Constantine straightens up in his seat, clearly eyeing up the clipboard.

01:43:00 Constantine says to an unnamed man in a suit, "You gettin' good stuff over there?"

01:43:31 Lily says to an unnamed man in a suit, "We'd appreciate a transcript of your notes sir."

01:43:38 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, that would be swell."

01:43:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And thank you."

01:43:40 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Well then. Ah reckon we've done what we came here ta do."

01:43:43 Constantine Stone says, "I forgot my pen."

01:43:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Constantine Stone.

01:43:58 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:44:02 Constantine Stone stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:44:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:44:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "So..."

01:44:03 an unnamed man in a suit stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:44:05 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth places a black cowboy hat atop his head.

01:44:07 Constantine Stone says, "Thanks for meeting with us, Mr. Lambeth."

01:44:08 Constantine Stone says, "As always."

01:44:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident salutes Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.

01:44:13 You wave to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "Thanks for the meeting."

01:44:16 Constantine Stone says, "And sorry the voice couldn't attend."

01:44:18 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Thank y'all fer comin'."

01:44:19 An unnamed man in a suit says, "I'll be in your office, Andrew. We have a lot to discuss."

01:44:20 You say to Andrew, "Take care."

01:44:21 an unnamed man in a suit briefly opens the door to leave.

01:44:22 An unnamed man in a suit walks south.

01:44:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "If we wish to try to attempt another meeting, can we simply phrase this the way that Ather stated it?"

01:44:34 Andrew shifts uneasily. "Yes. Of course."

01:44:59 Lily glances about the room with a half glare.

01:45:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth. "Part of the problem is that I think several of us were unware of what we could, and could not offer in our civilian capacity."

01:45:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:45:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:45:28 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "All Ah'll say is Ah don't believe another meetin' would be productive at this time."

01:45:29 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "Exactly."

01:45:33 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Have a good evenin'."

01:45:36 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth briefly opens the door to leave.

01:45:37 Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth walks south.

01:45:42 Constantine Stone says, "Well that was disappointing."

01:45:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs.

01:45:46 Constantine Stone sits down on an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:45:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Very."

01:45:48 You sigh.

01:46:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Poor guy, I'm pretty sure that guy was here to evaluate Mister lambeth."

01:46:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But Constantine, we don't always get straight answers out of Andrew during these meetings."

01:46:11 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:46:12 Constantine Stone asks, "Do you think he meant that another meeting with the Mutuality wouldn't be productive?"

01:46:19 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:46:24 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa switches a toggle on his black flip einrophone.

01:46:27 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa briefly opens the door to leave.

01:46:27 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa strides south.

01:46:33 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I think that's exactly what he meant."

01:46:39 Constantine Stone says, "Well that's interesting."

01:46:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Probably."

01:46:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just hope that that man from the President's office doesn't interfere."

01:47:04 You say, "That was really unnerving."

01:47:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sure that is where he was from."

01:47:13 Constantine Stone says, "Well, let's see."

01:47:16 Constantine Stone says, "Where does that leave us."

01:47:18 Constantine Stone says, "So, I said."

01:47:21 Shule takes several deep breaths.

01:47:29 Constantine Stone says, "If the encroachment was an accident, they should issue an assurance."

01:47:32 Constantine Stone says, "He said."

01:47:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was all but ready to take him out of the room but I am not that disobedient."

01:47:45 Constantine Stone says, "There won't be another meeting with the Mutuality, and left."

01:48:00 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:48:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods and sighs.

01:48:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Not at this time there won't. And I agree that attempting one right now is a bad idea."

01:48:37 Constantine Stone says, "Right, but I mean specifically."

01:48:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We need to let things cool off."

01:48:47 Constantine Stone says, "I mean the specific implication is that they won't issue the assurance."

01:48:55 Constantine Stone says, "I'm inferring because it was not an accident."

01:49:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:49:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:49:17 Constantine Stone says, "Which maybe we all suspected."

01:49:25 Constantine Stone says, "But it seems to me that they basically just said as much."

01:49:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well at least we were able to convey what occurred."

01:49:37 Constantine Stone nods.

01:49:37 You nod.

01:49:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or mostly didn't."

01:49:41 Constantine Stone says, "And I think that that's all we can do."

01:49:44 Shule nods slowly.

01:49:51 Constantine Stone says, "We can ask Vernos to ask them for an update in a few days, maybe."

01:50:02 Constantine Stone says, "But I think we can consider this matter shelved for the time being."

01:50:09 You say, "By then, we will probably have a new Voice anyways."

01:50:11 Constantine Stone says, "With their guarantee we have nothing to exchange for QSA access."

01:50:14 You grin at Constantine Stone.

01:50:16 Constantine Stone says, "Without, I mean."

01:50:18 Constantine Stone laughs.

01:50:20 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, that's true."

01:50:51 Lily says to Constantine, "Please be careful what you sayas all eyes are upon us in this room."

01:50:58 Constantine Stone nods.

01:50:58 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:51:10 Constantine Stone says, "Agreed, but I think they know all the things I just said."

01:51:11 You say, "Well, take care everyone."

01:51:14 You stand up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:51:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:51:23 Constantine Stone says, "And if they hear me and want to tell me I'm wrong, that would be most welcome."

01:51:26 Constantine Stone stands up from an ergonomically designed silver mesh chair.

01:51:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves. "We at least made a showing."

01:51:29 Constantine Stone nods.

01:51:30 Constantine Stone waves.

01:51:33 You wave.

01:51:35 You briefly open the door to leave.

03:53:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It will probably require about 9 or 10 more months though unless we just start earning more command per day. It seems when pilots are actively working, we can earn an average of about 3 command per day so with our scoop, then we'd gain a little over 100 per month."

03:54:01 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:54:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Still, I'm proud of us. We've been here for 13 months and I believe we've done well."

05:28:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I literally slept through it."

05:30:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey, did the meeting go well? I wasn't there, I'm sorry. The one day I'm not there."

05:31:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."

05:31:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wouldn't say it went well."

05:31:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It was a bit strange."

05:31:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

05:31:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think a representative from the government may have been there."

05:32:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh for fuck's sake."

05:32:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it was less of a meeting and more of an investigation."

05:32:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident sighs. "Of course. Because it's best."

05:32:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Into what happened at the Mutuality negotiation."

05:32:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Did lambeth at least try to explain the situation?"

05:33:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not quite, I got the impression Lambeth was sort of under review by this guy."

05:33:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wrote to him asking if there was something to be done. Apparently, the meeting was the result of that."

05:33:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the guy was restricting the conversation a bit."

05:33:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like we tried to bring up the encroachment on Mutuality space by the AEU fleet, and this guy wasn't have it."

05:33:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "He wouldn't really let us discuss it."

05:34:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I get you. Was anything being done? Is anything being done? Do I have to write more letters and stomp my feet?"

05:34:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think for now we're stuck."

05:34:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Alright, so nothing was done, then."

05:34:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I tried, at least. I did. I wanted to change something, or try to."

05:34:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily and Shule can weigh in on this, but from what I gathered, the Mutuality really wants an assurance that the encroachment was a mistake and a guarantee that it won't happen again."

05:35:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got the distinct impression that the AEU plans to make neither."

05:35:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Can we garantee it won't happen again? It's Best, he could go off at a gunshot warning."

05:35:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Before he left, Lambeth said he didn't think further negotiations would be a good idea for the time being."

05:35:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline makes a soft noise, more like a growl. "God damn it. Why can't we just make a fucking deal and stick to it. Oooh this makes me pissed off."

05:35:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree with Lambeth on this one, poor man."

05:37:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All in all it was fairly bad, but, at least we can say we've done all we can for the time being."

05:37:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm pretty sure the main reason that guy was there was to evaluate Lambeth."

05:37:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it looked that way."

05:37:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And Evangeline, I'm not sure the meeting was soely to do with your letter, they seemed to just be interested in wanting to know exactly what was said at the meeting."

05:37:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, still... I just... Ugh."

05:37:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Unless someone told you directly that was the reason, hoever they didn't ask about you."

05:38:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No they didn't, so that was good, because I wasn't there."

05:38:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You did your best, but yeah based on the meeting, it doesn't sound like thre's anything to be done about it at the moment."

05:38:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I guess we are stuck unless we can find a way to fix it somehow."

05:38:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know and I would do it again, to be perfectly honest."

05:39:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Are we still on strike?"

05:39:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That was not addresssed, but yes we are."

05:39:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Alright, I really wanted to asteroid haul or something."

05:40:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "As far as I can tell the strike should only end if Best reverses course or if we leave the accord."

05:40:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I can do something else, though."

05:40:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know how you feel about that, Eli, but I think if we leave the accord, if it comes to that, the union is going to need all the help it can get."

05:40:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah you can even do Accord salvage missions if you are wanting to salvage."

05:40:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey, Eli, do you have a ship capable of beacons? I have been doing a lot of those lately."

05:41:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I would do beacons."

05:41:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want more people for beacons."

05:41:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And holy fuck yes, I have 1000 exploration points... And I can't go across the skim to get anything because yeah."

05:41:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Vernos."

05:41:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

05:41:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I have a couple yes, but I'm not quite sure that I can do beacons right now."

05:41:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Of course we can always have someone bring us over, can't we? Is that allowed?"

05:41:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I believe so."

05:44:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I could have sworn that gives you industry though."

05:45:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Salvage mission do give you industry, but the actual resources go through the Accord, and the payout is not taxable by the Union."

05:45:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, all right."

05:45:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The strike is not specifically about industry points, it's about resources."

05:46:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "True."

05:46:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "One moment, in any case."

05:46:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you do something that makes it so that resources have to come through the Accord, then well, they'll have to stay in th eAccord to keep getting those resoruces, now won't they?"

06:29:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well if he didn't want to meet us, he shouldn't have been forced to do so."

06:29:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Of course if he was being interviewed or investigated..."

06:29:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed, I'm thinking maybe this is a sign of changes coming to the liaison office."

06:36:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries."

06:36:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just one more medium IFS wreck..."

06:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't worry folks, I'm sure this will all be over soon enough, for better or worse."

06:37:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's ok, I'm having fun..."

06:37:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That negative 213% on our progress surely did not go unnoticed."

06:37:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's what I've been thinking."

06:38:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well at least we can salvage without it being an issue."

06:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I mean do those missions."

06:39:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Goddess it was hard to put in the coordinates into the console there for a moment."

06:40:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I do love my mighty two grappel, though."

06:40:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A great grapple."

06:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I like it."

06:41:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But I hate rat's nests with a passion."

06:42:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh really? I've always liked doing those."

06:42:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As soon as I see all the good debris in a sector I know the rats are responsible."

06:42:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

06:42:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

06:42:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No, it's not that I hate... I haven't done of those in a long time."

06:43:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know right? You hit the debris scanner and as you read down the list and thinkg "Oh, wow there's so much really good chunks in here.. wow.. thre's so many.. wait.. too many...." then you check for ships and say "Oh shit!""

06:43:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Morris gave me some of my felo back, the one's with the mind reading capabilities? I think he did, though I've not seen any read each other's mind yet."

06:43:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No... Oh no. What?"

06:44:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What are you thinking?"

06:44:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "What with the strike on industry, there's likely to be a lot of scrap and debris floating about. Which means RATS."

06:44:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh that's cool. Evenia just gave me a feathered one to keep as a pet. He's great."

06:44:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, that's true."

06:45:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Guess we'll have to try and step up nest cleanings."

06:45:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

06:45:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Don't laugh."

06:45:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aww, sorry."

06:46:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "It's all right."

06:47:11 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

06:48:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It matters where you transfer your debris for salvage missions, doesn't it?"

06:48:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I thought it did."

06:48:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think it does, I always transfer at belt of orion."

06:48:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And they always go throguh."

06:48:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hmm."

06:48:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Through."

06:48:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Point."

06:49:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, well I always do mine at accord."

06:49:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's faster that way, really."

06:49:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awww, a kitteny kitty."

06:49:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do it slowly, almost sensually."

06:50:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "How's the soldier doing for you Eli/ Is he behaving?"

06:50:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "... Eli, what are you implying?"

06:50:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Do you think felo just slide out of their nests?"

06:50:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The solider is doing great, he's got a little horned helmet and marches around my ship."

06:51:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er the soldier."

06:51:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "I'm so glad."

06:51:11 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

06:52:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I have felo as my pets and lick you."

06:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have apparently done two missions in which I haven't been paid for, wow, racking up the money?"

06:52:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er they lick you."

06:52:16 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They do?"

06:52:29 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I didn't know they could lick you? Hmm."

06:52:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes, but only while you sleep."

06:52:36 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awww."

06:52:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli, that is a bit creepy if Felo lick you while you sleep."

06:53:44 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "Well I have never heard of a felo using it's tongue for anything other than eating."

07:02:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, so I never really thought it odd that a mass that pulses and that was spotted red was creepy, now, now I do, just a little."

07:02:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. what?"

07:02:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think it's cause it's right in front of me."

07:02:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What is this mass?"

07:02:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's a felo nest."

07:06:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there a rift speed plant?"

07:07:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You know I don't know. That is an interesting question to ask, though."

07:07:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know there is a normal speed plant."

07:08:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Salvage them."

07:08:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Is there really?"

07:08:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, Ali's org sells them."

07:08:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder how that even works."

07:08:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The plant must grow its way into the air pump."

07:08:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I just have an improved."

07:09:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Me too."

07:09:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nobody good."

07:09:31 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "That is helpful."

07:09:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was kidding, it was me."

07:10:07 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We are joking around aisling. Eve started the saying."

07:10:20 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It is missions."

07:10:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident sighs. "You know."

07:10:48 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Materials is materials."

07:10:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Accord missions aren't part of the strike, as I understand it."

07:11:00 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, I didn't make the rules."

07:11:11 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah and these are accord missions."

07:11:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well. I certainly didn't either. So I could be completely backwards wrong."

07:11:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Here we go, we're going back."

07:11:34 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Well, suppose is none of my business anyways. You do you."

07:11:57 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I think that's the right rationale. Apparently all the materials from accord missions go straight to the accord."

07:11:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I had to do something or go nuts."

07:12:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

07:12:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I am still transfering over to the accord though."

07:12:54 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Credits earned is credits taxed and money for economy of AEU."

07:13:13 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm sure you still pay taxes to your alliances for the income you receive, no?"

07:13:20 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I said, I didn't design the strike, but my understanding is that none of the credit income is taxable by the AEU."

07:13:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli would know, though."

07:13:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "He's the one who said we could do them."

07:13:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

07:13:41 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "And bonk, Aisling, bonk."

07:13:50 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Bonk."

07:13:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And I could be completely wrong. I'm certainly not AEU, or part of the strike. I'm just going on my understanding."

07:14:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not even going to try to argue with them. I'm honestly just doing what I was told I could do."

07:14:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm not really worried about it."

07:14:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Even if the money is going to the AEU, honestly, I don't know that they are really being affected much by this."

07:15:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess time will tell."

07:15:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't think so, not unless we did like, a ton of missions."

07:15:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can't imagine forcing myself not to salvage though, so I respect your efforts. I'd probably go half nuts."

07:15:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like for instance I don't think SHule and Ather salvaged a lot anyway."

07:15:37 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You enjoy salvaging?"

07:15:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It would be a very poor Alliance if it relied purely on the Civ Corp."

07:15:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know Eli did some, but I feel like this might not have reduced income levels much."

07:15:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, well I don't either, but since my only options are exploration, which I love by the way, or salvage missions, or beacons? I'm good."

07:15:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Fanatically so, yes."

07:15:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true, Dakhal."

07:16:01 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Then there's no way you have any room to go nuts."

07:16:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:16:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "The strike is really just a thorn in the side, but that's the point."

07:16:15 [General Communication] Emily Ford giggles.

07:16:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, there's plenty of other stuff to do."

07:16:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I swear, everyone says that."

07:16:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been able to work on exploration really hard."

07:16:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's something."

07:16:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do wish I knew if we could do Tesla."

07:16:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know, I would actually do tesla."

07:16:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wrote the EAOS liaison, but we don't know what resources from Tesla go to the AEU."

07:17:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I miss it, especially because it can be hard to get a nest crew."

07:17:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "True."

07:17:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But like I said before, I miss scooping."

07:17:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah."

07:17:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could really go for a scoop or two."

07:17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Buuuuut, we can't."

07:18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Uuugh, I need to like, compelte that third mission but I can't, ooh but I have 20 million extra AEU credits now."

07:19:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I had been going after my lock evasions for a long time."

07:19:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I feel like for the past month it has been really tough to even get a destroyer beacon going."

07:19:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't know. I haven't been doing many lock evassions, though I suppose I need to now."

07:20:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So what do I need a clipper for?"

07:20:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A cruiser for, I mean."

07:20:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well... I don't even have a clipper, so I get what you're saying to some extent, though not really. We haven't really been doing that many beacons as it stands anyway."

07:20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Maybe this would be a good time to start."

07:20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

07:21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It gives us combat, but not a whole lot of industry. I don't think so at least."

07:21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do beacons give industry?"

07:21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not sure."

07:22:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "I just miss scooping, since I was getting quite good at it."

07:22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I never had much for the courier runs."

10:01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which the gemini doesn't have."

10:02:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What are you talking about?"

10:02:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Comparing the long range scout and the gemini."

10:03:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Uh...contantine, what is this headline about?"

10:03:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I did some accord salvage missions."

10:03:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's a media spin, as usual."

10:03:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  well crap I guess we can't do those."

10:03:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aisling and Anfisa asked how I could do that during a strike."

10:03:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, really?"

10:04:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "At least they called me valiant."

10:04:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's kinda what it looks like."

10:04:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's something."

10:05:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess I misunderstood how it works?"

10:05:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought we knew that accord salvage gave no resources or money to the union?"

10:06:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, they're no ttaxable, so the alliance gets no money out of it. I would assume that they would eventually get resources, but that those resources would then be distributed later through the Accord."

10:06:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So you wouldn't really be giving them to the allilance, but to get them, they'd have to get them throu the Accord."

10:07:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that was my understand."

10:07:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Understanding."

10:07:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone coughs.

10:08:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Of course, like you said. It's possible that it's just spin. I notice they didn't say what kind of work you did."

10:08:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

10:09:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It just says you broke the strike, but yet doesn't say something like Future Voice does work for Accord."

10:09:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll see what I can find out."

10:10:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Am I the only one who has done accord salvage?"

10:10:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I figure Ather and Shule definitely haven't."

10:10:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm guessing."

10:11:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I havent done shit and cant afford my phone or apartment."

10:11:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So do some beacons or something?"

10:20:14 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Full Dive". The organization has earned 2,702,440.13 credits.

10:20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's been too long since I took the fighter out to zero some RATS."

10:20:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "There's been a lot of them since the strike started."

10:21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You know what contantine, I think Eva did a mission earlier, but she trasnfered directly to Accord."

10:21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, sorry, I just woke up from a nap."

10:21:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, she did, but I figured her doing it just wouldn't make headlines."

10:21:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe that's the difference."

10:21:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It could be."

10:22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it's not like I really need to do them."

10:22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just won't do them again."

11:11:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I can be wide awake with absolute zero energy and unable to sleep."

11:11:58 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I don't have boundless energy either. The only time I can consider working all day is an hour before I start work."

11:12:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Think they're tellin us they'd love to have it. Ted, Eve...your orgmates, wanna put one up?"

11:12:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Ali and I did 14 stations yesterday and I'm still recovering."

11:12:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...I do have more energy than that then."

11:12:51 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm going to place a bet that they're not sure of their position and want a hypercast to get a heading."

11:13:07 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Definitley. H7 all the way."

11:13:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why they were askin for news the other day. Not so they could hear the news, but 'cause they knew we'd have to hypercast at 'em to do it and get a headin."

11:13:52 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Someone did hypercast at them though."

11:13:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I did."

11:14:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Never got an exact headin 'cause I got a late start. Got busy with somethin and couldn't get to the Torus when I'd intended to."

11:14:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. She says lovely."

11:14:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

11:14:55 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Ah, gotcha. Well I know Cats has their turn at midnight. Not much I can do until then."

11:16:35 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "We sent 'no' and they said 'lovely'"

11:16:41 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Gotcha."

11:16:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh the rental."

11:16:57 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Oh, temp hypercaster. Not sure."

11:16:58 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I hate such condescending attitude. Don't really encourage me to go put one otu there."

11:17:27 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm afraid I tend to agree. If you're lost, be upfront about it."

11:17:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

11:18:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't get how you guys are getting all of that out of them just asking if a beacon was there?"

11:18:15 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "With that said, I think I'm going to head to the Accord and grab some hot buttered toast and a mug of that really strong coffee."

11:18:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They ain't askin bout a beacon. And we know the history Eli."

11:18:34 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "That's how it usually goes, Eli."

11:19:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what the message said though? I'm just asking because both of the trips I was on recently both asked the same question and were not lost?"

11:19:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No it didn't. They asked bout a hypercaster, not a beacon."

11:19:51 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "You asked the beacon chain."

11:20:01 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I gotcha."

11:20:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Correct, we did ask about the chain, just for convenience."

11:20:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hypercaster's used for findin where they are. Beacon ya gotta know where ya are to need one up pretty much."

11:21:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hence why I'm askin if they're lost. 'Cause if they are, somebody might wanna give 'em a hand with a station and find 'em."

11:21:17 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Okay, off I go to the Accord for breakfast. Sorry Colton."

11:21:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I may join ya Emily. Good stuff over there."

11:21:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Long's ya don't mind the company."

11:21:55 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Not at all."

11:22:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Emily, torus restaurant has a baked potato, but it's part of a die dish two different guys."

11:22:24 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Method in my madness. I'm going to sign up for my salvage missions, eat breakfast and sit by the QE for a while."

11:22:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo."

11:22:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er two different kinds."

11:22:42 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Oh Eli, you really are thoughtful."

11:22:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eli, you check that place in Landfall?"

11:23:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they didn't have any."

11:39:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

11:48:11 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Breaking news, the incoming message suggests a heading request."

11:48:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

11:48:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ted, if you wanna put up a hypercaster for 'em, I can tell ya what parts you'll want. Station's gonna cost ya somewhere roundabout 20 megacredits."

11:49:00 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's quite passive, they're getting their headings and their beacon types mixed up."

11:49:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That would be helpful, thanks Morris."

11:49:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. I'll make a list for ya."

11:50:22 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "All I recall is the hypercaster and the rest is fairly standard station stuff."

11:50:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Core, solar, and I need to double-check which hypercaster top, but I think the Ultra."

11:51:16 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Whatever the highest I can get no doubt."

11:51:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's likely the ultra. I think it's 2500 exploration and 2000 command."

11:51:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They should be close enough ya don't need an antenna."

11:53:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hopefully they'll tell us how far out they are, their NDB will tell them that much."

11:53:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'll ask."

12:05:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ted, looks like 80-some, so that ultra should be fine with no antenna."

12:05:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Just that, the Solar, and a core?"

12:06:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

12:06:07 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK, I'll sort that."

12:21:47 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yep."

12:22:05 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Can you tell them to hypercast? I'm not getting an answer yet."

12:22:09 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Sure."

12:22:19 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thanks."

12:22:55 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You may not be able to hear their hypercasts though, you may need to keep transmitting until they hear you. At which point they'll probably respond over the QE."

12:23:05 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."

12:23:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just send H1 to let 'em know we're tryin."

12:24:03 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Outgoing QE message from AFW Command to Perla Marion: H1 <END>"

12:24:13 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Power 25 really enough for 15 light years?"

12:24:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I ain't quite sure. We ain't got firm numbers on them tops. That's why I said increase it from 25."

12:24:48 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."

12:25:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, we ain't quite sure bout their headin, so it's gonna take some playin round with the direction."

12:25:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's what I'm trying this very second."

12:25:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It'll take a bit. If ya need a hand or a break, just holler."

12:26:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My first go at this, and I don't feel like doing much else, so all good, and thanks for the help."

12:26:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure thing."

12:26:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "If they were heading back from Tom Town, they probably did start heading down some, so 60 might be a bit too high of an elevation."

12:26:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Last I knew, she gave me 70."

12:26:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So that already was goin down some from that. But their plan was also to head southeast outta tom town, possibly up too. So I ain't sure where they are exactly."

12:27:29 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "We could have just put up a capital beacon and enjoyed taking out the responders."

12:32:50 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla Marion to AFW Command: H0 <END>"

12:32:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm."

12:33:34 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I forget what that means."

12:33:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Means they didn't hear it."

12:34:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "H2 means it's clear, H3 garbled but understandable, H4 is too garbled."

12:34:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK, well, I'll hear their messages come in at least, I don't mind being here."

12:34:49 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Perhaps try power fifty?"

12:34:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's where I am."

12:35:13 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Just going through different headings."

12:35:26 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Try swinging the hypercaster in five degree increments, and hypercast the numbers your pointing at each time you shift it."

12:36:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Are the calibrations more help to them?"

12:36:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's only gotta go 50 light-years. And that top can go quite a bit further than that, just not sure how far. Just member the higher the power, the closer on the right headin ya gotta be. It's like a water spigot. Put your finger over part of it and it hits less stuff but comes out stronger."

12:36:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not yet."

12:36:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean you could use 'em...but they won't be able to respond with their hypercaster till they're right up on ya."

12:37:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "By that time they'll be well within comms range."

12:37:33 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'd be tempted to try an elevation of fifty, then swing it from 270 to 360 in five degree increments."

12:37:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK."

12:37:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. That and try higher."

12:38:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Clearest I got 'em tuesday was at 70 or 75."

12:38:56 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Three days ago? They're probably quite a bit lower elevation now."

12:39:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They'da had to go straight down to get lower elevation."

12:40:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I hope everybody else doesn't have to hear all these tests, sorry if you do."

12:40:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

12:51:33 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nope."

12:52:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm hoping they will send a QE when I do, so everyone will know."

12:52:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They should."

12:54:54 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You might actually want to try a much lower elevation, perhaps thirty."

12:55:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, they coulda been in a storm or somethin that pushed 'em down."

13:04:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But yeah, I'm fine."

13:05:01 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Glad to hear it."

13:05:24 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You missed your chance to nominate for neighbourhood office."

13:05:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I probably wasn't going to anyways."

13:05:52 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Next term if anything."

13:07:40 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I voted for Icy."

13:07:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Much bonking in the future of space combat."

13:07:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Woo, I voted for Aisling."

13:08:04 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Icy is a great choice. He'll cactus anything that's hostile."

13:08:27 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Should that be cacti?"

13:09:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I voted for Teddy."

13:09:16 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "He'll cacti anything that's hostile? No, I think it's cactus in that case."

13:09:20 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Teddy's going to war."

13:36:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Not yet."

13:36:38 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You'd hear a message come in, they'll have to QE."

13:37:05 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What are you doing."

13:37:14 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "What elevations did you try?"

13:37:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Trying to guide Johann's trip in."

13:37:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I've tried everything ranging from 20 to 80 and now I'm filling in ones I haven't tried."

13:37:57 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ah."

13:38:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "How far East were they the other day?"

13:39:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Dunno. She told me 300 but I wasn't able to get 'em clear. Tried from 270 to 330 or so."

13:39:30 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I started with 300, like you said."

13:39:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Didja try both directions offa that?"

13:39:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."

13:39:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So long story short they're incredibly lost."

13:39:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm."

13:40:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What's the highest ya went up for power?"

13:41:11 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's possible they swung too far rimward, you could try swinging it around from 300 down to 250."

13:41:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "50, these things go at least as far as Hall of Pain, so it really shouldn't be more than that."

13:41:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It is possible, yeah."

13:42:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also possible they're nearly directly above us, or even down some. With the lack of crew coverage they've been havin, it wouldn't surprise me none."

13:42:30 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'd give it a go at a power of maybe thirty."

13:42:47 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Did they have a full crew when they went out?"

13:42:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, I'm trying a whole mix of powers too."

13:42:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They had a max of 10."

13:43:13 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Don't change multiple settings each time or you'll not be able to know what's working."

13:43:27 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I know."

13:44:21 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "When is the next org timeslot for the hypercaster?"

13:44:28 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thing is, depending who's been awake when I've been asleep, just about any direction is possible."

13:44:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Libs at 20:00."

13:45:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "They knew they had no charter, so I guess there's not much that can be done. If they kept a log, they should have a rough idea of their position."

13:45:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lessen they're keepin a log like Johann did on his last trip."

13:47:48 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla Marion."

13:50:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Goin ok."

13:50:37 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "That's quite a personal question."

13:50:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Not bad, trying to guide the trip in."

13:50:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is it now?"

13:50:50 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Guide the trip in?"

13:50:55 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm good thanks Mel, how about you?"

13:51:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm. Nicolette's needin a headin."

13:51:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Johann's trip."

13:51:05 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Good here, thanks."

13:51:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yeah, they've stopped asking for news and now said they need help lining up."

13:52:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Very nice."

13:52:25 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Or bullseye."

13:52:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "250 did it."

13:52:30 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You didn't move the hypercaster after that message started coming in, did you?"

13:52:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow."

13:52:32 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Change Johann's hypercast slot?"

13:52:48 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I did, but then I put it back as soon as I heard it start."

13:52:58 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Temp hypercaster."

13:53:03 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ah."

13:53:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What'd the elevation end up bein Ted?"

13:53:49 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "30."

13:53:52 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'd maybe try five degrees either side and wait for a reply."

13:54:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow. They musta hit a good storm pushed 'em down then."

13:54:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah, it was totally clear Emily."

13:54:24 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'd leave it go. They said h2."

13:54:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "She's got a headin now, and they're only 50 light-years out."

13:54:27 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Mess with their heads."

13:54:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Can't hurt to send them a few calibrations now."

13:54:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It wouldn't."

13:55:06 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "They probably went too far up."

13:55:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Uh, not far enough rather."

13:55:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, anyone can come back here if they need more."

13:55:36 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Tell them you're a relative of Famous Pete, and that you're somewhere far Spinward. Tell them to turn around and set a heading of 234.56 with an elevation of 78."

13:55:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They shouldn't. If they're as close as she said with the NDB, they've got all they need."

13:56:08 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "78.90. please complete the set."

13:56:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

13:56:21 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "In theory, Nicolette ought to be able to figure it from there."

13:56:28 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Fine, just mess with their heads and be done with it."

13:56:28 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla Marion."

13:57:49 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "In fact, they've done pretty much exactly what happened to me when I was trying to line us up in Goss's carrier that time."

13:58:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They were comin from southsoutheast and up. So they've gone pretty far west and down in a couple days."

13:58:58 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thought they were further east than they were."

13:59:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Actually, up and southsoutheast."

13:59:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not if you got 'em at 250."

13:59:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They were closer on 300."

13:59:38 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, they thought they wre further east, so went more west than they needed."

13:59:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

13:59:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Either that or hit a storm."

14:00:29 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Glad I suggested you try knocking it over rimward a bit, that could have been a wild duck hunt."

14:00:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I am too, I wasn't far from looking over there anyway, because I remembered it happening to me."

14:01:36 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Over-compensating for not having a chart, perhaps."

14:02:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Charters are bloody convenient to have, and helpful, but the skill of lining up on the NDB is something we should keep up."

14:02:36 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I agree."

14:02:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Absolutely."

14:02:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If the person who can read the chart's in bed, you can at least get it goin good."

14:03:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."

14:03:28 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

14:03:34 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And if you're out of chart range, you've no choice anyway."

14:03:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

14:05:25 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Well to be fair, if that's Nicolette, she's probably tired and wanting to make sure she gets things set up before nodding off."

14:05:43 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I think this is her usual sleep time."

14:05:43 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And I don't blame her."

14:06:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, and Johann and Alexander are up now, so that's good."

14:06:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yup, they'll be fine."

14:06:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Shouldn't be long before they hit the chain either."

14:06:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. When they told us their NDB's a couple hours ago, they were 83 on the standard."

14:07:04 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Is the chain even up?"

14:07:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

14:07:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "270 is."

14:07:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is it called 270?"

14:07:29 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "They broke it."

14:07:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's called something different, but you can still find them if you look."

14:07:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "When you put up that hypercaster it was waypoint X-somethin-or-other."

14:07:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, I noticed that."

14:08:03 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "So they put up a station and didn't finish."

14:08:15 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Rather brilliant."

14:08:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looked like they put up 2, Mel. And 270 after it went down but 271 fore it went down."

14:08:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Then just let the rest be."

14:08:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Basically wasted two stations."

14:08:47 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Pretty much."

14:08:58 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep, they're saying thanks for the help."

17:31:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Iknow the thing with constantine last night, was that I had told some of them itwas ok to do Accord salvage missions. This is because they are bringing in things for research by the Accord and not bringing in resources for the alliance. But I'm guessing that I'm wrong about that."

17:31:50 [General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Can someone remind me what I ned totr gen Can someone remind me what button or command I need to tell the computer to jump back to chet? I forget the name of the sector of speace its in."

17:36:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Iknow you are talking strictly about points and credits."

17:36:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm talkin bout what the AEU government gets, period."

17:40:03 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So who's down for beacons?"

17:40:14 [Tactical Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "I am."

17:41:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The only people I nkow of that have been hauling, are folks who are not participating int he strike."

17:41:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Which are newer folks, like Dakhal."

17:42:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually, I'm fairly certain he's the one who has been doing any resource work at all."

17:42:56 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "It is thought that counts."

17:43:18 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Have folks that don't normally do much industry as it is done anything to get attention?"

17:43:37 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Long story short, the news will use whatever it can to further it's agenda. I thought this was already something we all knew."

17:45:14 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I plan on finding out more about the Accord missions today. What I had found out before is that they are not taxable by the government, and according to the source, they actually lose the alliance money as they are for the Accord, this headline has gotta be about something else."

17:45:47 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Perhaps you have a striker who's covertly working."

17:45:48 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sure to a point but the alliances must still be getting something."

17:46:01 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The income you make is probably taxed, even if they don't get the debris itself."

17:46:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If ya want 'em to stand up and take notice, sometimes ya gotta do things that ain't comfortable. Picket, stop workin altogether. I'm sure the Accord'd understand."

17:46:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what I'm saying, the Union said that they are not taxable."

17:46:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wonder if the Union's tellin ya somethin a bit self-servin..."

17:46:46 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Credits are credits. They can be taxed."

17:46:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm sure they could find a way if they wanted to."

17:47:21 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Ask the Accord if you're in doubt."

17:47:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Honestly that don't make no sense. If I salvage comaprable debris, I'm gonna make the same amount of credits whether it's for missions or whatever. So it's gotta be taxed."

17:48:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But yeah, if you really want to be taken seriously, just stop doing everything completely. No nothing at all. Only defend your home sectors if they get attacked by outsiders or IFS."

17:48:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Don't even bother fighting off pirates."

17:48:24 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Unless they attack you or something."

17:48:26 [General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "What's a good place to do asteroid mining?"

17:48:28 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's one of the many reasons why they want to leave the Accord, and any resources they get would have to come through the Accord. So if they wish to continue getting those, gotta stay I the Accord."

17:48:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Zackery, I sent ya a book. The best location for the Fringe is listed in there."

17:48:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I guess I'm gonna have to bother Shea once again."

17:48:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't member it off the top of my head."

17:48:52 [General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Ah, thanks."

17:49:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Any asteroid hauling station, Zackery. Barnham's belt, for example."

17:49:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

17:49:11 [General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Thanks."

17:49:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "And as I said, talk to the cadet orientation officer too."

17:49:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I don't think you guys have a one best place."

17:49:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They do."

17:49:32 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They do?"

17:49:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

17:49:51 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I was under the impression that it was all the same for everyone except for Crias which is only accessible by us."

17:49:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

17:50:00 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well then."

17:50:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh and Zackery, if you're still interested in beacons, we're in the old earth lounge."

17:50:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looks like they only have one alliance station though. Barnham's Belt. If they mine elsewhere, they get taxed out their rear ends."

17:50:43 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh I see."

17:51:00 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "We've got three cause we're awesome."

17:51:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or is it four."

17:51:06 [General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Beacons sound good, on my way."

17:51:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We've got three, AEU and Mutuality have two, EAOS and Fringe have 1."

17:52:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm also wondering if this had something to do with transferring to the temp station. I believe Eva did an Accord mission yesterday and there was no prbolem, but then constantine did one last night using the temp station and and it was seen as breaking from the strike."

17:52:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whereas Eva transfered hers directly to the Accord."

17:53:14 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "90 percent sure we get the physical debris from those stations. Because the cores are league."

17:53:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno. Stations pay a bit more 'cause their taxed slightly less. I'm pretty sure you get taxed takin it to Accord based on interalliance tax law or somethin."

17:54:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure it' distributed on some level, but again that all goes through the Accord."

17:55:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm actually wondering if it's what Emily said. Someone working anyways, and saying they're not. Sometimes folks have a funny idea of what exactly things mean."

17:57:32 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Always about the taxes."

18:01:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "~e{%o?"

18:05:27 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

18:10:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "]i Eli."

18:10:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hi Tara."

18:10:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Welcome back to the madhouse."

18:10:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "|e>~>"@#-:t _n co&m@'range."

18:11:14 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person strike gunboat "My Label Maker Ran Out Of Tape".

18:11:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I thin>]I sh,u%' be sa$~ng than-%."

18:11:40 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh Erik."

18:11:45 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes ted?"

18:11:52 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I love your names."

18:12:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Welcome back Tara!"

18:12:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If you like them so much you should come beacon."

18:12:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "";=n$&you!"

18:12:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

18:12:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That would require me to move from my balcony."

18:12:55 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So move."

18:13:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Lily, do you have ay idea what this hdeadlien is about?"

18:13:04 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You're moving to hit the button on the comm, you can get out of your chair."

18:13:07 [General Communication] Ted Warburton sighs.

18:13:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "Er, do you have any idea what this headline is about?" Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

18:13:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I don't have to get out of my chair to use my comm."

18:13:37 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Someone fling his comm across the room."

18:13:48 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nobody has access to my apartment."

18:13:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sec, I hadn't seen the latest one."

18:13:55 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Such a lonely life."

18:14:01 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I know right?"

18:14:23 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Such is life."

18:14:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I haven't any idea. I'm not the one in charge of the strike."

18:14:45 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "We can recreate one of those action holovids and repel down the wall all the way to your balcony."

18:14:59 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

18:15:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know, I'm just trying to find out what happened."

18:15:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So beacons."

18:15:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Askign folks is about the only way I can do that."

18:15:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton groans.

18:15:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or will we actually have to toss Ali off a roof."

18:15:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have no idea. I haven't been available for awhile so it sure hasn't been me doing work."

18:15:48 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Toss Ali off the roof, that could be amusing."

18:15:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Actually that might be kind of fun to watch shh."

18:16:19 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Can I eng?"

18:16:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Taken."

18:16:32 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Too lazy then."

18:16:37 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Shame."

18:16:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Didnt 'turn in any belt points or anything? You were the third top contributor. I'm not tring to accuse anyone of anything, I'm just trying to find out what's going on."

18:16:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm just waking back up."

18:17:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We were still down a ton on our progress goals, so folks aren't doing much for sure."

18:17:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I turned in belt points because I had no information concerning the details of this strike and I thought it was only for the prior conquest so yes I did turn in belt points but nothing since. Shule nor anyone provided me with anything."

18:18:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah right on."

18:18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I doubt that's what it was then."

18:18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Butyou can obviously see others did more than I did."

18:18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

18:19:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "(>|?e]needs%|?},e &?s%}!ic trans`+&io] d/,i)e@"

18:19:08 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Huh, that didn't take long."

18:19:16 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Glory to the AEU or something like that."

18:19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yeah, prety sure those are from them doing beacons and Nests. Other alliances are teling us we should stop doing those too but those are more about protecting human safe."

18:19:26 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Can't even keep up a strike."

18:19:26 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.

18:19:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er space."

18:19:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Still, our performance was down minus 213 percent, that sure is not being productive."

18:19:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You should teach them how Keegan, I'm in the right mood to help you just now."

18:20:25 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "It's easy: go spend your money in League, Fringe, or Mutuality ports."

18:20:42 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "And don't actually do anything that will gain you points."

18:20:47 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "At all."

18:20:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or credits."

18:20:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And picket."

18:20:55 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Or credits."

18:21:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Actively protest."

18:21:08 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Don't half ass it. Either go all in or not at all."

18:21:14 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Eh, I'd argue that not buying things on AEU planets is actively protesting."

18:21:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If you're still trying to find ways to make points that's half assing it."

18:21:28 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Because hitting people in the wallet is a lot more effective than going DON'T DO THIS BAD THING GUYS."

18:21:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If ya want the government to take notice, they gotta feel it."

18:22:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If I was AEU Whip, I'd be naming and shaming, oh, wait, you don't have a Whip."

18:27:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "W} ki_da.hav) '(~ ri&t f?/w -_,+# ^ga'sn!@us(>i*&> &^w."

18:36:25 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm good to go again."

18:36:41 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "And that was the wrong control... but yeah pilot, launch another."

18:36:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

21:09:44 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

23:45:43 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

23:51:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:51:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:51:27 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

23:51:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:51:58 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:52:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

23:52:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:52:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:52:16 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:52:16 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:53:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:53:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:53:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:53:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:53:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:53:57 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

23:54:51 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:54:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:54:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:55:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:55:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:55:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
