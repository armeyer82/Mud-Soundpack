00:05 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm, I mus twrite some letter templates for all the stuff I craft for people."

00:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey John meet Jacob. Perhaps you two ould team up on doing some of the Space vermin Patrol missions."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Could too."

00:16 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hello John, nice to meet you. I am Jacob, like she said."

00:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

00:16 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Howdy there."

00:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hi, Ather."

00:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] John Fulguris transmits, "Does anyone know of a trade route from new earth?"

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Most of the more profitable trade routes are not as good anymore due to current alliance relations."

00:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] John Fulguris transmits, "I just need to make some credits."

00:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Let's see if we can't squish mama. This is gonna hurt, either way."

00:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] John Fulguris transmits, "And I have a cargo hauler."

00:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I recommend mail delivery, asteroid mining."

00:21 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "What?"

00:21 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Uh, have fun?"

00:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm going after a mother nest. That's what."

00:22 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, I'd have totally helped with that if you had wanted."

00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Talk to the officer in the Liaison building as he has work for you. Also, go to Space vermin Patrol where there are a lot of missions you can go to. Also, go to the mail room and request to deliver mail. There's a lot of work out there where you can make credits."

00:22 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Have fun!"

00:22 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I mean, good luck and things."

00:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If this attempt fails, you're on."

00:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hell. If this doesn't work. I'll go with the other plan of a spinward. If you have one. Which I think you do."

00:25 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep."

00:25 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What's your plan though?"

00:25 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Perhaps we can iron it out so you don't have to make a second trip. Discuss and shoot, and all that."

00:26 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "League. Fringe. AEU. Mutuality."

00:26 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Or could help people like me who still want to do theirs!"

00:27 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's not a bad plan. You can use the Mutuality to erode her, and the Fringe can do what it does best."

00:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's the plan. I mean I can always try again if this doesn't work."

00:28 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Knockout doesn't work on either of them? Has that been confirmed by now? Or is it just supposition?"

00:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I believe it was confirmed."

00:28 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I swear it did."

00:28 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I swore it did too, Johann."

00:28 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I swear we knocked out mother and killed megabat."

00:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Rats are always getting smarter."

00:29 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's what I use to do back in the day when I tanked those nests."

00:29 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "That is true, and unfortunately our battlesuits don't get any better equipped to deal with them."

00:29 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I've tried to knock out both of them at least 3 times. Maybe fourth time is the charm."

00:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Okay. General going off so I can concentrate without distractions. At least I'm in the suit I love and know best."

00:31 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "It's all about the birthday suits."

00:48 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Well, now I'm sweaty and all but that was excitin'."

01:00 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Debate.

01:00 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

01:00 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah fine, I guess I'll stay voice."

01:01 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You guys doing OK on that nest?"

01:01 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "So far we're surviving."

01:01 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Survival is good! You pass the halfway point?"

01:01 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Not quite. I can almost see it though."

01:01 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Try to knock out mother. See what happens!"

01:02 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I don't think anybody has it. We're in tier three's."

01:02 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, no, then you don't."

01:03 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Scratch that, even if someone could knock out mother don't do it!"

01:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:10 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "This is where I wish we had snipe."

01:37 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:37 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

02:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:05 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 964" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:05 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What are you doing michael?"

02:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:05 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

02:05 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Sitting in my ship, staring at a jada person, interesting, huh?"

02:05 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yes, lounging."

02:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:06 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:06 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I'm not!"

02:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:06 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:06 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:06 
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.

02:49 [General Communication] Lorenah Mayfield transmits, "I'm sure you would."

02:49 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "It didn't win."

02:49 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Hawthorn did, and I didn't pick it."

02:50 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "If I had it in my hand and it worked, I'd certainly would use the skullfucker."

02:50 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I need a shirt that says this."

02:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ask Brunhilda."

02:51 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Ask...who?"

02:51 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "She can make all the t-shirts. Fit. Color. Design. You name it. They aren't free though."

02:52 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Hey, I wanted a shirt that says, Michael is cool, why didn't you tell me she could do this!"

02:52 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Just pop her a letter and ask. She's only slightly scary. Don't let the eight eyes put you off. All the better to design your glorious personal t-shirt."

02:52 [General Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Wait, who, what, where?"

02:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I shall repeat this. Custom t-shirts. Brunhilda is your woman. Fit. Design. Color. You name it. She can do it. They aren't free.

02:58 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Then why didn't you come show your horrible skills like proper cool folk."

02:58 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Because I'm highly against anything that isn't productive!"

02:59 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Might be that, all the same, no?"

02:59 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "He's sterile so he's shootin' blanks."

02:59 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I think this went down, or south, or something."

02:59 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'd say galactic down and very slightly south."

03:00 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "270, -85.0."

03:00 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not quite."

03:01 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Well shit, I didn't feel like grabbing my reference."

03:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Change that 85 to a 90. You were super close."

03:01 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "That's just straight down."

03:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "270 -90."

03:02 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "You said very slightly south though."

03:02 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "There's no south to that."

03:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh yeah. Kindly ignore my amazingly specialness right now. I need coffee. You were right."

03:02 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr whistles.

03:03 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup you could have even entered 270 -89 and that would work but 90 either direction is always down or up."

03:04 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "...what?"

03:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I had what some call. A blond moment. Which is really fucking hard. Considering my natural hair color."

03:04 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh I can legitimately get away with my blondness heh!"

03:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:04 [General Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:04 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can't. My natural color is jet black."

03:05 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "I've got brown hair. That count for dark?"

03:05 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sure!"

03:06 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "What color eyes yall got then."

03:07 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Dark brown. I'm also dark-skinned, so that tends to come with package."

03:07 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Blue green, depends I guess."

03:07 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Mine are green, bu' they're like Olive drab so like yellowy green?"

03:07 [General Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

03:08 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I don't recall. I haven't seen a mirror or a sufficiently pale person in quite a while, and I have been through the rift, so one never knows."

03:09 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Oh good I'm told they're still blue."

03:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What I didn't tell him. Is that they're sticking out on stalks from his head. And wiggling around."

03:09 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What the bloody blue balls!"

03:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chortles.

03:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

03:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'd feel sorry. For any man with blue balls. Let alone if they were bloody too. I mean talk about a messed up situation."

03:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:10 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:10 The ship is already moving.

03:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

03:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:11 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Right but now I'll never bee able to say what the bloody blue balls in front of johann again and keep a straight face."

03:11 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

03:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:11 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

03:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:11 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

03:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:11 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Plenty of b's in there, almost enough to make the docking bay at nouveau quebec proud."

04:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:42 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:43 The ship is already moving.

04:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:43 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:43 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:43 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:43 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:44 Board what?

04:44 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

05:02 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

05:02 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:17 [Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]

15:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, and a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.

15:48 You kiss Lily Kaise.

15:48 You smile at Lily Kaise.

15:48 You say to Lily, "So I came here."

15:49 You say, "And no problem."

15:50 Lily Kaise says, "Oh too, I can't finish it for a couple of hours so I was either going to hangout in Dove for a bit. I came in here as I hadn't figured out how much time I have before I need to complete the site."

15:51 I don't see that here.

15:51 You nod to Lily Kaise.

15:51 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

15:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

16:35 Lily Kaise glances at her metallic gold touch einrophone and checks her missed calls.

16:36 Lily Kaise says, "Need to go pick up mail. Melinda is probably screaming about our Asteroid processor."

16:36 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:36 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starfish, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

16:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:36 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:36 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:36 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:36 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:36 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:36 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Starfish! Welcome to home space!"

16:36 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

16:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

16:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:36 You smile at Lily Kaise.

16:37 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

16:37 Lily Kaise says, "At least I didn't instigate this one. It was Ather's idea actually."

16:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:37 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Starfish. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:37 You grin at Lily Kaise.

16:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:37 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:37 Lily Kaise says, "But that area is unclaimed so they really cannot dictate to us."

16:37 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

16:37 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:37 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

16:37 Lily Kaise glides out.

16:41 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

16:42 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

16:42 You smile at Lily Kaise.

16:42 You kiss Lily Kaise.

16:42 Lily Kaise kisses you.

16:42 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

16:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:42 Lily Kaise says, "Heh she did want to speak about the stations but I can't really interact with her at the moment."

16:42 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:42 You say, "Ah ok."

16:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starfish, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:42 Shule nods understandingly.

16:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:42 Lily Kaise says, "Who knows, perhaps they are not happy that they have to spend so much."

16:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:43 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

16:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

16:43 You laugh.

16:43 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:43 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

16:43 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:43 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 412" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

16:43 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Starfish! Welcome to The Torus!"

16:43 You say, "That wouldn't surprise me."

16:43 Lily Kaise asks, "Amazing how economy of scale counts?"

16:43 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 905" has jumped into the sector.

16:43 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 905! Welcome to The Torus!"

16:43 You say, "Yep."

16:43 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

16:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

16:43 You say, "For sure."

16:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:44 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 905" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

16:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:44 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Starfish. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

16:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:44 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

16:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:44 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

16:44 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:31 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

19:32 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Going to Old Frontier. If yyou don't want to go, now's your time to escape!"

19:32 Lily Kaise grins at you.

19:33 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

19:36 Lily Kaise says, "I plan to begin another site and we'll have to stay here until after conquest end most likely so I can take you back in a few if you would prefer that because I plan to stay here."

19:37 You say to Lily, "Nah, I'll stay here with you."

19:37 Lily Kaise says, "Ok fair warning then."

22:01 Kim Saunders says, "Oh, I turned my operate tasks back on too early and that probably gave a poacher a chance to steal some drones."

22:01 Kim Saunders says, "Uh, metals."

22:01 Constantine Stone says, "Oh."

22:07 Lily Kaise asks, "Which mission?"

22:08 Constantine Stone says, "The turtle suit."

22:08 Lily Kaise says, "Oh hmm that you know is a good question and didn't even consider that aspect."

22:08 Lily Kaise asks, "How much is your Space Combat?"

22:08 Constantine Stone says, "Space combat seems pretty pointless so I sort of stopped doing it after 1500."

22:08 Constantine Stone says, "1549."

22:08 Lily Kaise says, "Oh wait it should be fine."

22:09 Lily Kaise says, "But ifever we got the Morning Star we would need I htink it's 5000."

22:09 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, but I don't need a morning star even if I had access to one."

22:09 Constantine Stone says, "I don't even really need a cruiser."

22:09 Constantine Stone says, "There aren't enough active AEU pilots to fill it."

22:09 Lily Kaise says, "Also I'm not certain of the requirements for the Flare or the patriot but you may not meet those either."

22:10 Constantine Stone says, "I meet the requirements for the Patriot, but can't get it, and I have no interest in owning a flare."

22:10 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow I'd love a Flare!"

22:10 Constantine Stone says, "I just feel like what's even the point of it."

22:10 Constantine Stone asks, "To do harder beacons than I do currently?"

22:10 Lily Kaise asks, "Huh?"

22:10 Constantine Stone says, "I could do that, but I'd risk losing the flare."

22:10 Constantine Stone says, "Then I'd have to apply for another one."

22:10 Constantine Stone says, "Huge pain."

22:11 Lily Kaise says, "It's a corvette that's the point and much more powerful than the Bolt Thrower."

22:11 Constantine Stone asks, "So? What would you use it for?"

22:11 Constantine Stone asks, "Beacons?"

22:11 Constantine Stone says, "I have ships that I can do beacons in."

22:11 Lily Kaise says, "Shule and I have fended of lots of pirates and beacons and so on."

22:11 Constantine Stone says, "Responding to sieges? Our navy can do that without our help, and probably has, because there are only ever like 3 of us around."

22:11 Lily Kaise says, "Yes."

22:11 Lily Kaise says, "We have."

22:11 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I'm just saying I don't feel like I need a flare to do those things."

22:12 Lily Kaise says, "Ok to each his or her own I suppose."

22:12 Lily Kaise shrugs.

22:12 Constantine Stone says, "I don't know. I've been around for almost a year and I've never felt like I needed a combat ship to do anything."

22:12 Constantine Stone says, "I'd rather have access to any kind of exploration ship."

22:12 Constantine Stone says, "But that won't happen any time soon."

22:12 Lily Kaise says, "Well we may at some point but you're at least good at it."

23:15 Disruption, Harassment, and Discrimination

Star Conquest frequently involves conflict with other characters. We understand the frustration when things don't go your way, and when another character is becoming the bane of your existence. However, you must always be sure that your argument is with that other character, and not with the real person behind him or her.

   - Any interaction with other characters, even (or especially) when you're angry, should be fully in character, unless you mutually agree to break character.

   - It's generally a bad idea to address any comments, particularly angry ones, to the player behind a character without some kind of permission or invitation, even privately. Such things could get you in trouble if the other player feels uncomfortable as a result.

   - Even if your retribution against another character is technically in character, you should take care that your punishment does not unduly affect the player's ability to play. As an example, it's technically possible and even, technically, in character to strand a person far out in uncharted space from which he or she has no hope of ever returning. For obvious reasons, however, this is illegal. At the end of any conflict, all players involved should still retain the opportunity to progress their characters.

   - Squidsoft.net maintains a zero tolerance attitude towards interaction in the vein of racism, discrimination, sexual harassment, and homophobia.  We seek to provide a comfortable gaming atmosphere, and having to be subjected to scrutiny because of racial, cultural, gender identity, disability or sexual orientation damages not only the integrity of the gaming environment, but also the person being discriminated against.

   - It's also walking a thin line to have your character be racist, homophobic, etc. even if you aren't. We strongly recommend against it. We're especially reluctant to accept this as an excuse after the fact.

   - Remember that conflict is an aspect of roleplaying. This goes both ways, because while a "victim" player should not complain about properly roleplayed conflict, nor should an "aggressor" player attempt to spark a conflict without it being a justifiable part of their character. What this specifically refers to is players who connect to the game just to harass other players verbally, attempt to grab and strand random players, or attempt to steal or destroy ships, but do not roleplay or even play the game much at all. Players who start a conflict should be involved in their characters and therefore have something to lose themselves. But the act of connecting to a game, not out of interest in playing it but just to cause havoc and watch the reaction, has a specific name: trolling. The staff will not tolerate this and we'll step in as necessary.

   - Generally and most importantly, when engaging in player vs. player conflict, we ask that you keep your a
23:15 ctions somewhat in proportion with the situation. For example, if your character is insulted on the comms, it is probably not a proper response to pursue that player across the galaxy, destroy all of his ships, and end up holding him hostage on an abandoned, airless station somewhere indefinitely. We recognize that different characters will have different levels of response, but at the end of every conflict, everyone involved should be able to pick up the pieces and resume progressing through the game. Make sure that your actions are merely part of a conflict between characters, and that your intention isn't to somehow punish the player behind that character.

   - Harassment which spills out into the real world, even just the real "online" world, is taken extremely seriously, and instances of this often leave us no choice but to ban the player who cannot keep the worlds separate. This is partially the reason why we encourage players to play a character separate from themselves. If a player proves that they do not have the capability to separate IC from OOC, they likely do not belong in this game.

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
