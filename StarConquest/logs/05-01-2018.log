00:28 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:28 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:28 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:28 Keegan Wantz, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:28 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap and a pink synthcotton shipsuit with a flaming star printed on the collar. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer.

02:17 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says to Melinda, "Where are we and what happened to the expedition."

02:17 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

02:17 Melinda Michaels glances at Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn.

02:18 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn asks, "What?"

02:19 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Okay...I'm bored, I know. sorry. How are we doing though?"

02:26 Lily Kaise asks, "So how is it going to work with a slower ship? Say you want to haul a carrier to Andy's in a faster ship for a Docking bay upgrade?"

02:26 Melinda Michaels says, "The speed of the slower ship wins."

02:26 Morris Corlew says, "The slower ship gets the speed of the faster ship."

02:26 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

02:26 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ugh, I'm feeling sleepy..."

02:26 Morris Corlew says, "That's."

02:26 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:26 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn sighs.

02:27 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

02:27 Morris Corlew says, "I know when my sightseer was controlled by a galleon and they put up the jib, we got faster speed."

02:27 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

02:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah I dunno."

02:27 Melinda Michaels says, "That's the theory."

02:27 Lily Kaise says, "Ah well figured but at least you'd have better sensors to work with on the faster ship or so-called faster ship."

02:27 Morris Corlew says, "We might just have to play with it more."

02:27 Lily Kaise nods.

02:27 Lily Kaise says, "I put it on my Platform."

02:27 Melinda Michaels says, "However."

02:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around your neck.

02:28 Melinda Michaels says, "I wouldn't try dragging an unmanned ship along."

02:28 Lily Kaise says, "Oh no I wouldn't do it that way just was trying to figure the speed aspect."

02:29 Morris Corlew says, "It may not work if the computer on one ship don't register anybody aboard. I mean...if I were the EAOS I'd design it thataway."

02:29 Lily Kaise says, "Well never intended to take it unmanned."

02:29 You nod.

02:29 Morris Corlew says, "It's been talked bout. Other folks wantin to do it."

02:29 Lily Kaise says, "After all if the link broke, it wouldn't be easy to catch it."

02:29 Morris Corlew says, "Heh. Nope."

02:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:30 Morris Corlew says, "That's what them folks didn't seem to get."

02:30 Morris Corlew shrugs.

02:30 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow seriously now?"

02:30 Morris Corlew nods.

02:30 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:30 Lily Kaise says, "Ok..."

02:30 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah well..."

02:30 Morris Corlew says, "Not all pilots think of doin the responsible thing."

02:31 Melinda says to Lily, "Though if you have a carrier needing upgrades, so do I. We could link and hit both places."

02:31 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh true!"

02:32 Lily Kaise says, "Well i'd like to upgrade the org's and Shule would to upgrade his but we'd probably upgrade Shules first."

02:32 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:32 Morris Corlew asks, "Can we link more'n two?"

02:32 Melinda says to Lily, "Okay well, we'll get settled in at home and then sort it out."
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

02:32 Morris Corlew says, "I mean...the computer calls it a rift group."

02:32 Morris Corlew says, "Not a rift pair."

02:32 Lily Kaise asks, "I upgraded mine a long time ago when I could still chart and remember we did that carier-a-van convoy?"

02:33 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:33 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:33 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

02:33 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

02:33 You grin.

02:33 You say, "I remember that."

02:33 Morris Corlew says, "Well no...I'm thinkin of the org's, Shule's, and Mel's."

02:33 Lily Kaise nods.

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "I am not sure, we'll need to test."

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well I wouldn't put the 1.5 billion upgrade on my carrier heh."

02:33 Morris Corlew nods.

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "Well not yet."

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Elaine and I tried to test but."

02:33 You nod.
Morris Corlew says, "Not all ships need it."

02:34 Lily Kaise nods.

02:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I just put it on my platform and that was really the only ship I intended to add it to."

02:34 Morris Corlew says, "Like...it's gonna be a long time till I can get it at all, and I was able to be pulled by Mel."

02:34 Lily Kaise says, "Well that is pretty cool."

02:34 Morris Corlew nods.

02:34 You grin.

02:34 Lily Kaise smiles.

02:35 Morris Corlew says, "Pretty sure I couldn't take leadership...but it worked."

02:35 Lily Kaise says, "Well heh if I still can fly in a week or so, we'll try some things."

02:35 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:35 Morris Corlew nods.

02:35 You nod.

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "I feel as though I'm writing out my last will and testament 'er something like that."

02:36 Lily Kaise shrugs.

02:36 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:36 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:36 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:36 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Could always change your position and try speaking out loudly."

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "I have and got nowhere."

02:37 Morris Corlew says, "Well...I kinda wonder if they'll just see that QE as an emotional outburst...since legally you can't renounce citizenship over the QE anyways."

02:38 Lily Kaise says, "I put up protest signs in space I've run lots of traders out of dodge. I've also picketed and protested and spoken out over the Public access System. I don't think others realize what we've done."

02:38 Lily Kaise says, "That's not all."

02:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe refuse to help defend against minor skirmishes and things if they allow the rogue navy back to work."

02:39 Morris Corlew nods.

02:39 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh I won't cooperate with the Rogue Navy at all!"

02:39 Morris Corlew says, "Mayb risk roguing...but some things're worth it."

02:39 Melinda Michaels says, "I mean, if one of your pilots is interdicted, that's different of course."

02:39 Morris Corlew says, "Maybe I mean."

02:39 Lily Kaise says, "I'm ready to state openly that if they go after the Mutuality, I'll fight for the Mutuality."

02:40 Melinda Michaels says, "Do that and think the refusing to help thing over."

02:40 Lily Kaise says, "So yeah I'll probably end up in prison for treason."

02:40 Melinda Michaels says, "It may get you rogued but hell, I'd do it."

02:40 Morris Corlew says, "Speakin out to every news source that'll listen may be a good place to start too."

02:40 Morris Corlew says, "Write statements to everybody you can find an address for. See what happens."

02:41 Melinda Michaels says, "If there is anything I can do to help, just ask."

02:41 Morris Corlew says, "Same here."

02:41 Lily Kaise says, "Thanks."

02:41 You nod. "Thanks."

02:41 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh one more thing for clarification."

02:41 Melinda Michaels says, "The not working thing does not include outsider and IFS invasions, we aren't that bad."

02:42 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be there to help with that stuff."

02:42 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah uh...that was clearly mentioned when we had the meetin and vote."

02:42 Morris Corlew says, "We'd never leave y'all at risk like that."

02:42 Morris Corlew says, "It also has nothin to do with any kinda social interaction."

02:43 Melinda Michaels says, "But yeah if y'all want to go against the navy issue, we'll have your backs."

02:43 Morris Corlew nods.

02:43 Morris Corlew says, "Absolutely."

02:43 You say, "Thank you."

02:43 You say, "We appreicate that."

02:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

02:43 You say, "Appreciate."

02:43 Melinda Michaels says, "Welcome."

02:44 Lily Kaise says, "Hes we sure would as I am so totally against the Rogue Navy."

02:44 Morris Corlew says, "Well...we've always wanted to support y'all. It's not wantin to support Best that's caused the other stuff."

02:44 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

02:44 Lily Kaise says, "Well yeah I'll be honst and say that I felt as though you wanted to punish us for what our shithead parents did."

02:44 Morris Corlew says, "Nah."

02:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah I get that."

02:45 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:45 Morris Corlew says, "Some of our newer pilots thought that too. Since they weren't there for the meetin we had back in December. But...it's never been meant as a punishment to y'all."

02:45 Melinda Michaels says, "It wasn't the case though and I think us getting to talk a bit on this trip is helping understanding on all sides."

02:45 Morris Corlew says, "It has to do with helpin Best make credits...and...we don't want nothin to do with givin him a proverbial dime."

02:46 Melinda Michaels says, "We know Ather isn't happy with working with us but, who cares. He's not the ruler of your alliance."

02:46 Lily Kaise says, "When we've really felt as though our hands were tied and trust me if we can figure out ways to interfer with their process, to protest or to do whatever it takes. I jsut believe most of us got really demoralized to some extent."

02:46 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

02:46 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:47 Morris says to Lily, "I get that. And totally understand. Been there myself in some situations."

02:47 Lily Kaise nods.

02:47 You nod.

02:48 Lily Kaise says, "I really appreciate it when you all called me out the other morning I've really been in a frump over this."

02:48 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be around."

02:49 Morris Corlew says, "Well...political or diplomatic issues ain't got nothin to do with personal relationships."

02:49 Lily Kaise says, "I am just so angry and well there are just no words to describe it because this goes against everything."

02:49 Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise.

02:49 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

02:49 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah it's bad, for us all."

02:49 Morris Corlew says, "It is."

02:49 Lily Kaise says, "Such that I don't want to be a citizen of such a Government. Still I feel as though I'm giving up my life."

02:50 Morris Corlew nods.

02:50 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:50 Lily Kaise says, "'Shule and I both feel this way."

02:50 Morris Corlew says, "I get that. It's your home and it's bein controlled by somebody you see the harm of. I can only imagine...and I don't envy the position y'all're in."

02:51 Lily Kaise says, "Ather probably has a free ticket to the Mutuality. We probably have nothing."

02:51 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:51 Morris Corlew says, "Council ain't exactly his biggest fan."

02:51 Say to whom?

02:51 Lily Kaise says, "Well you'd like to think so but they're not any of our biggest fan and I don't blame them but they are next to impossible to deal with."

02:51 You say, "Maybe, but he's one of the most experienced pilots around."

02:51 Morris Corlew asks, "Wouldn't he have to go unreg without grand amnesty bein applied if he did that? Unless Best negotiated on his behalf?"

02:52 You say, "As for Lily and I, we feel we're expendible."

02:52 Lily Kaise says, "Naa if they offered him citizenshp, he could just go for it but obviously under their terms. There's some different angles especially if it's for political reasons."

02:52 Melinda Michaels says, "That's why you might want to rethink things."

02:52 Morris Corlew says, "Our government did it with Akemi...but there were a lotta diplomatic issues that got our government movin on it."

02:53 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:54 You say, "My government probably feels I've out lived my usefulness as a pilot anyways."

02:54 Morris Corlew looks at you thoughtfully.

02:54 Lily Kaise says, "Yep we definitely are expendable but I don't even feel that I want to be a part of my own alliance anymore. I know that time will change things and I seriously doubt Best will be able to serve another term but I jsust dunno... after what happens to what's left of things while he is in office."

02:54 Morris Corlew asks, "Is his VP as much of a nutter as he is?"

02:54 Morris Corlew says, "Or wait."

02:54 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:54 Morris Corlew asks, "Do y'all have a VP?"

02:55 Morris Corlew says, "I'm terrible at extra-alliance government..."

02:57 Lily Kaise nods to Morris Corlew.

02:58 Lily Kaise says, "He can only serve three terms max but I doubt he will go beyond this current one."

02:58 Morris Corlew says, "I mean...if I'da gotten a B in any kinda government but that...my pa woulda ripped me a new hind end. But uh...that was just a section in a few classes and uh..."

02:58 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:58 Lily Kaise nods.

02:58 Morris Corlew says, "Kinda ashamed of my lack of knowledge. Need to get some books and stuff I guess."

02:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

02:59 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:00 Lily Kaise says, "Ours is supposed to be a democracy ike government as we have a senate and house of ministers or such but each 'yeah I know what you mean. I didn't set out to study politics myself."

03:01 Lily Kaise says, "Democracy-like I meant to say and we're divided up into electoral regions which correspond to our various Worlds."

03:01 Morris Corlew nods.

03:01 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, pretty much the same as ours."

03:01 Lily Kaise nods.

03:01 You nod.

03:01 Lily Kaise says, "They call them regions and each has it's own number of votes and so on."

03:02 Morris Corlew says, "I know uh...is it League Reform? one of our parties...is lookin to make representation a bit more similar to the AEU system. One of the reasons I need to learn more bout it."

03:02 Morris Corlew says, "Our system is sadly very Earth-centric."

03:02 Lily Kaise nods.

03:02 Morris Corlew says, "That's somethin I agree with 'em on. But...some of their other policies they've had and the rumors...well...gives me great pause."

03:03 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

03:03 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

03:03 Melinda Michaels stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:03 Melinda Michaels says, "Be back."

03:03 Melinda Michaels strides south.

03:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:13 A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.

03:15 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

03:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

03:21 Morris says to you, "She's tryin to get your ear."

03:21 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:21 You grin at Morris Corlew. "YEah, I can see that."

03:22 Lily looks over at ASteria snd says git 'im.

03:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:22 Morris Corlew grins.

03:22 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

03:22 Morris Corlew gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

03:22 Morris Corlew says, "Smooch by proxy."

03:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:22 Lily Kaise says, "Right on."

03:22 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:23 Lily Kaise says, "Great speed but too bad we've not encountered any storms thus far."

03:23 Morris Corlew nods.

03:23 Morris Corlew says, "Was a couple days fore we saw our first one comin out too."

03:23 Lily Kaise says, "True."

03:23 You say, "That's true."

03:23 Morris Corlew says, "Least we got good speed. Comin out...them first couple days were kinda sucky."

03:24 Lily Kaise asks, "So I feel really remis but I never really got the general total LTC we traveled to the site?"

03:24 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:24 Morris Corlew asks, "Um...somethin like 140?"

03:24 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:25 Morris Corlew says, "Mel's got the total for sure. Might ask her."

03:25 A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.

03:25 Lily Kaise says, "I knew it was in the neighborhood of between 1000 to 1200 Light-Years but didn't think we traveled 1200 Light-Years."

03:25 Morris Corlew nods.

03:25 Lily Kaise says, "So 140 LtC sounds about right."

03:25 You nod.

03:25 Morris Corlew says, "Was somewhere tween 130 and 140. But...I was real lax on countin it up too."

03:25 Lily Kaise nods.

03:27 Lily Kaise says, "Well we got there that's all that matters. Nobody can chart or nobody has a chart which covers this far out either even in rimward unless you ahve that big huge one from across the Skim or Anfisa's huge Spinward."

03:27 Morris Corlew says, "The big one of Anfisa's might, but the other one certainly wouldn't."

03:27 Lily Kaise nods.

03:27 Morris Corlew says, "Lose that probably round 40 on the long-range NDB."

03:28 Lily Kaise says, "Well the one across the skim did cover up to the nebula that time."

03:28 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:28 Morris Corlew asks, "That nebula's inside Torus NDB range, ain't it?"

03:29 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm good question I don't remember and we traveled in Nissi's Combat Carrier which I don't think can have a Long-Range nDB."

03:29 Morris Corlew nods.

03:30 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. And its regular NDB is from the Torus. And that ends fore you even get to Mutuality space or real close to it."

03:30 Lily Kaise nods.

03:30 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:30 Morris Corlew says, "Actually, it might have a long-range."

03:34 Morris Corlew says, "Oooh. We got new cadets."

03:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yep we have some new ones in aEU too and I really don't want to abandon them."

03:34 Morris Corlew nods.

03:34 Morris Corlew says, "They could use some guidance."

03:34 Morris Corlew says, "All cadets can."

03:35 Morris Corlew nudges you suggestively.

03:35 Morris Corlew says, "That guy helped me a lot when I was a cadet."

03:35 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

03:35 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

03:35 Lily Kaise says, "Yep we've been working with the ones we've had lately and there are a couple very promising ones and a couple of... well there's some in every crowd."

03:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:35 You nod.

03:35 Morris Corlew grins.

03:36 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. We get our fair share, so does the Fringe."

03:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

03:38 You say, "I'm not sure I was very promising when I was a cadet."

03:38 You chuckle.

03:38 Morris Corlew says, "I probably wasn't either. But...I made it."

03:38 You say, "Thankfully that was only about a week or two. Even after that, I took a while to really get my feet under me."

03:38 Morris Corlew nods.

03:38 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:39 Morris Corlew says, "Yep. Same kinda deal."

03:43 You say, "But out of the ffive or so cadets that became pilots around the same time I did, I'm the only one that's still here."

03:43 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:44 You say, "It's sad. The rest either resigned or were imprisoned."

03:44 Morris Corlew says, "Tryin to remember who became a cadet round the time I did...Ted, Eve...Melissa uh...Cantrelle? Who's now retired."

03:44 Morris Corlew says, "Bunch that never made it outta cadethood."

03:44 You nod.

03:46 Morris Corlew chuckles. "There was the Fringe guy...the 80-some year old that I managed to majorly offend my first night at the spaceport."

03:46 You chuckle.

03:47 Morris Corlew says, "He kept goin on bout how could his government allow the other alliances to get better trade deals. Badmouthin the Fringe government. I told him that probably wasn't a good idea."

03:47 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that's the way. It's amazing how much is spent on pilot training and they get here and are gone in a week or two."

03:47 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

03:48 Morris Corlew says, "That guy hung round for hmm...over a year? We've had a few like that. Show up from time to time."

03:48 Lily Kaise says, "H yeah we have too."

03:48 Morris Corlew asks, "Oh uh...what was that guy's name. Real weird one. Raiyoku?"

03:48 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that was one."

03:49 Lily Kaise says, "We've had at least a couple though."

03:49 Morris Corlew nods.

03:49 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:49 Morris Corlew asks, "Whatever happened to that guy's got y'all's whip office?"

03:49 Lily Kaise says, "Heh yeah, I keep hoping a new pilot will run for it."

03:49 Morris Corlew nods.

03:49 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "How goes the blackwing? Everyone okay over there? With all your tasty food, and drinks, and..."

03:50 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And Tegan!"

03:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

03:50 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:50 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We're good."

03:50 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

03:50 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:50 You say over the linked rift comm, "We're alive and kicking... I think."

03:50 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:50 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:50 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "How're things on the Frenchy ship?"

03:50 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well don't kick Morris in the antler. I don't think medical can fix those."

03:50 Lily Kaise says, "Then Ather stole my thunder when I was trying to encourage Casen and says oh we really don't need a whip. Well as a newer pilot I learned a lot by holding that office a term."

03:51 Morris Corlew says, "Oy."

03:51 Lily Kaise nods.

03:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Why do people listen to him."

03:51 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not bad here. Everything is still stable."

03:51 Morris Corlew says, "No idea."

03:51 Morris Corlew sighs.

03:51 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:51 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Awesome."

03:51 With a jerk and a rumble, the ship slows down.

03:52 Lily Kaise says, "Well as you all know, I don't just wag my tail and follow along which is whey we don't always get along."

03:52 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:52 You say to Melinda, "When I was in my first year of piloting, everyone told me that Ather was our ace and pretty much told me tolisten to him."

03:52 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:52 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "And we have Torus NDB."

03:52 Morris Corlew exclaims, "Woo!"

03:52 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Woo."

03:53 Melinda Michaels says, "I have a story."

03:53 Morris Corlew says, "Also in local space."

03:53 Melinda Michaels says, "Always have a story."

03:53 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

03:53 Lily Kaise grins.

03:53 Morris says to Melinda, "I like stories."

03:53 You ask, "It's story time?"

03:53 Melinda Michaels says, "There was this one time in a meeting."

03:54 Melinda Michaels says, "I could have agreed with two pilots, one being our ace."

03:54 Melinda Michaels says, "Who usually has good ideas."

03:54 Melinda Michaels says, "While this idea wasn't a bad one they brought forth."

03:55 Melinda Michaels says, "At the time it could have, I felt, muddied the waters."

03:55 Melinda Michaels says, "So I opposed."

03:55 Melinda Michaels asks, "Guess what happened?"

03:57 Morris glances between Lily and you.

03:57 Lily Kaise nods.

03:58 Melinda Michaels says, "People followed and the opposition won."

03:58 Melinda Michaels says, "Point here is."

03:58 Melinda Michaels says, "If you think you've got ideas, don't let anyone squash you just because they are an ace."

03:58 Lily Kaise nods.

03:59 Morris Corlew says, "An ace is an ace because they've fought and been an asset durin a time of war...maybe they can fly...maybe they got name recognition. But it don't mean you got all the answers all the time and everybody just gotta follow ya."

03:59 Lily Kaise says, "Oh that is a given."

03:59 You say, "I agree. I don't see eye to eye on most things with Ather. Even when it comes to combat."

04:00 You chuckle.

04:00 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:00 Morris Corlew says, "Except Ather's so often been treated like he's got all the answers to all the questions and can do no wrong. Cept...that just ain't true."

04:00 Lily says to you, "Well your experience is more current too."

04:00 Morris Corlew says, "Ain't true of any human."

04:00 Melinda Michaels says, "He's treated like that because, thus far, people let it stay that way."

04:00 Morris Corlew nods.

04:00 Lily Kaise nods.

04:01 Morris Corlew says, "When I was a new pilot, I fell into that too. This person is an ace or a veteran...their word is law. Well...it really don't work thataway."

04:02 You say, "Nah, it doesn't. After people told me that, 'i actually started to challenge some of his ideas that he taught people. Even when it came to combat. My strategy works for me. His works for him."

04:02 Melinda says to you, "What's your strategy."

04:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

04:02 Lily Kaise says, "As I say i've never totally followed ather. I listen to what he says but I've actually sort of... put him in his place a couple of times and he doesn't like it very well but so be it."

04:02 Morris Corlew nods.

04:02 You say to Melinda, "Depends on what I'm fighting."

04:02 You say, "And what I'm fithing in."

04:02 Melinda Michaels nods.

04:02 Lily Kaise says, "I could never get him to apologize to the Mutuality though."

04:02 You grin.

04:03 Morris Corlew says, "And he expects 'em to capitulate and rescue is hind end."

04:03 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

04:03 You say to Lily, "I don't think he knows the meaning of apologize."

04:03 Morris Corlew says, "His."

04:03 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

04:03 Lily Kaise says, "Yup go figure."

04:03 Lily Kaise says, "Oh he doesn't."

04:03 Morris Corlew says, "I really think he expects the Council'll just roll over. 'Anythin for you, Ather.'"

04:03 Lily Kaise says, "But had he done so, we might have made some progress over there."

04:03 Morris Corlew says, "But I honestly think the Council's smarter'n that."

04:04 Lily Kaise nods. "They are."

04:04 You nod.

04:05 A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.

04:05 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey, use your blinker!"

04:06 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:06 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Wasn't our turn to."

04:06 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:06 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Y'all's side. Y'all's blinker."

04:06 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You merged in in front of us. We were going straight."

04:06 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Use a tentacle to nudge 'em out of the way."

04:07 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:07 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Funny, so were we! Now I'm gonna cuss you out, flip you the bird, and we'll have us a lil road rage incident goin on."

04:07 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:07 You say over the linked rift comm, "I was going straight too. Straight to hell if I don't change my ways."

04:07 Lily Kaise says, "So this is my plan. I will wait and see what they do to us for participating with this Expedition. They really didn't tell us we couldn't but that doesn't mean they won't act merely from the other alliances and I will not support the Rogue Navy so I think you can read clearly between the lines.because they can. I do want to observe the political fallout."

04:07 Morris Corlew grins at you.

04:07 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Shule, you're so passed hell there's no going back."

04:07 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

04:07 Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise.

04:07 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:07 You say over the linked rift comm, "I so appreciate the vote of confidence there."

04:07 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Any time."

04:07 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:07 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:08 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh, fun, I haven't had one of those since I was driving through france. The French can't find the road if their cars drove themselves."

04:08 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:08 You say over the linked rift comm, "There are roads in France?"

04:09 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:09 Lily Kaise leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:09 The voice of Lily Kaise comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes they make their own!"

04:09 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, roads, sidewalks, it's all the same to them. The only safe place is the outdoor eating areas outside the cafes."

04:10 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:10 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:10 You say over the linked rift comm, "YEah, the road is whereever you want it to be."

04:10 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You sure those're safe?"

04:10 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:10 You say over the linked rift comm, "Those aren't safe either."

04:10 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, the French don't mess with their food."

04:10 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:10 Melinda Michaels grins.

04:10 You laugh.

04:11 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:11 You say over the linked rift comm, "The french like their food, their wine, their chocolate, and their cheese."

04:11 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You sound like you've been there."

04:11 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:11 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "How bout the Germans? Is only the beer safe?"

04:12 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Mmm wine, chocolate, cheese...I hate you people. There was maple whine here, till there wasn't."

04:12 Morris Corlew considers an elegant crystal decanter thoughtfully.

04:12 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:12 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We got wine. Sounds like y'all got whine."

04:13 The voice of Anfisa the Wanderer comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You will need to explain your joke."

04:13 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We are good drivers. I mean, if we weren't, we would have put speed limits on the autobahn by now."

04:13 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We have a decanter of wine. Y'all got Eve, who's whinin."

04:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:14 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I wasn't whining, simply sad that there was not much maple wine. I love that stuff."

04:14 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:14 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Awww."

04:14 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I have two bottles of wine."

04:14 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "But not maple wine."

04:14 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:14 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Somehow I'm sure you'll manage."

04:15 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And we do have the keg."

04:15 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh of course I will. I might or might not have drank what Pierre had left on the first day we were out."

04:15 The voice of Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I could use a pint, that's for sure."

04:16 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

04:17 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:18 Morris Corlew says, "Probably due for a repair stop soon. Been nearly 25LTC since our last stop for reps."

04:19 Melinda Michaels nods.

04:19 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

04:19 Melinda Michaels strides south.

04:19 Lily Kaise nods.

04:20 Morris Corlew says, "My guess'd be us. Um...was nearly 18 fore our stop, then 22.5 for theirs. So uh...been over 50 LTC since our drive last broke."

04:20 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

04:20 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

04:21 Morris Corlew says, "No sorry...under 50. But not by much."

04:22 Melinda Michaels asks, "What?"

04:22 Morris Corlew says, "Was sayin it'll probably be ours to break."

04:22 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

04:22 Morris Corlew says, "Been almost 50LTC since ours gave out last."

04:22 Melinda Michaels navigates her indigo slider einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

04:23 With a jerk and a rumble, the ship slows down.

04:23 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oy, horrible drivers. The idea is to speed up. Where did you get your license, a box of rations?"

04:24 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:24 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, the Outsider ones. Worked hard for that mess."

04:24 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:24 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "For those wanting to know, we've gone roughly 63 LTC's. We should have 90ish to go."

04:24 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Copy that Mel."

04:25 Morris Corlew says, "Ah. Bit further'n I was thinkin when Lily asked."

04:25 Morris Corlew nods.

04:25 Morris Corlew says, "Neither one of us paid attention to the numbers comin out."

04:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

04:28 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:28 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ian must be busy but I imagine Anfisa could possibly get us a good heading if we need it."

04:28 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:28 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Probably porin over all them sensor readins."

04:33 A small vehicle pulls alongside, kicking up dust, before speeding ahead.

04:34 Lily Kaise glances down at her neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

04:34 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:34 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "That wasn't nice. Now I gotta clean my windshield."

04:34 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:34 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well time for me to go waste precious time in life on sleep!"

04:34 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:34 Morris Corlew waves.

04:35 Morris Corlew says, "Rest well."

04:35 Lily Kaise waves.

04:35 Lily Kaise says, "Thanks will try."

04:35 Morris Corlew nods.

04:35 Morris Corlew says, "Get Shule to rub your back or somethin."

04:35 Morris Corlew grins.

04:35 Lily Kaise says, "Was good talking with you all this morning. I appreciate it."

04:35 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

04:35 Morris Corlew says, "Sure thing."

04:35 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Laters!"

04:35 Lily Kaise walks south.

04:35 You wave.

04:35 You stand up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:35 You say, "Night all."

04:35 Morris Corlew says, "Later."

04:36 Morris says to you, "Go rub her back, man."

04:36 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:36 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:36 You say over the linked rift comm, "Night all."

04:36 You wave.

04:36 You can go north, east, south, and west.

04:36 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a personal hoverpallet here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out.

04:36 Lily Kaise removes a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

04:36 You're not wearing a pair of black spacesuit boots with a gold stripe down each side.

04:36 Lily Kaise puts a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

04:36  You are wearing a light gray shipsuit with silvery gray trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on his shoulder. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

04:36 You are carrying a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria' in your left hand.

04:36 Lily Kaise lies down on a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it.

04:36 You carefully remove a Tardick lizard named Asteria from your shoulder.

04:36 You put a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

04:36 You give a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria to Lily Kaise.

04:36 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:36 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:37 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:37 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:37 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

04:37 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

04:37 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:37 Lily Kaise puts on a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

04:37 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:38 Lily says to you, "I love you Hun."

04:38 You beam at Lily Kaise. "I love you too babe."

04:38 Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:39 Lily says to a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria, "Go to sleep in there."

04:39 Lily Kaise grins.

04:39 You grin.

04:39 I don't understand that.

04:39 I don't understand that.

04:39 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

04:40 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:41 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:41 Lily gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.

04:41 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:41 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

04:45 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mel, Eve said nap well."

04:50 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

04:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:03 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

05:06 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tail.

05:07 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

05:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

05:07 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:10 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:10 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Zeus's warm scaly skin.

05:11 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Well hello there Zeus."

05:11 You laugh.

05:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:12 Lily says to you, "Guess it's time we got some sleep but with two flickety tailed lizzies in here."

05:12 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:12 You say to Lily, "Well love, I should say good night. I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:13 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:13 Lily says to you, "I love you."

05:13 You say to Lily, "I love you too."

05:13 You say to Lily, "Night."

05:13 Lily says to you, "Nite."

05:14 Lily Kaise lies back on a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

05:15 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

05:15 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:15 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

05:16 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:16 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:16 Lily says to you, "Nite."

05:16 You say to Lily, "Night."

05:18 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out.

05:19 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly out.

05:26 Bolts of lightning crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

05:37 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

05:40 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

05:40 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

06:02 The snow underfoot grows more shallow, with a thick rough surface of ice just underneath.

06:13 One of the group falls down into the snow. Others struggle past, too exhausted to help.

06:23 The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.

06:33 The group slowly struggles closer to the city.

06:37 The swirling snowflakes thin out a little.

06:41 The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.

06:41 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

07:11 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

07:16 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

07:26 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

07:36 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

07:43 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

07:43 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

08:13 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

08:15 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

08:26 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

08:36 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

08:45 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

08:45 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

09:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

09:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:15 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

09:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:25 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

09:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:35 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

09:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:45 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

09:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:04 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

10:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:10 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

10:10 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

10:16 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

10:16 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Repairs."

10:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:23 Keegan Wantz, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We were at about 17 LTC when you dropped us, aye Ali?"

10:23 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not completely repaired yet. I'll post it."

10:24 Keegan Wantz, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else awake for internal reps?"

10:33 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

10:33 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

10:33 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

10:33 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

10:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

10:35 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

10:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:03 The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul screaming within.

11:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:12 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

11:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:22 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

11:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:32 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

11:34 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

11:34 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

11:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

11:44 The snow comes down more thickly by the second.

11:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:04 The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.

12:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:10 The snow comes down more thickly by the second.

12:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

12:20 Wind whistles sharply over the icy plain as the group struggles closer to the city.

12:22 The snow grows deeper and progress toward the city slows.

12:26 The snow grows deeper and progress toward the city slows.

12:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

12:28 The wind picks up sharply. The traveler groans and leans into it.

12:29 The snow grows deeper and progress toward the city slows.

12:30 The snow comes down more thickly by the second.

12:36 The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.

12:36 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

12:37 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

12:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:43 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi Mel."

12:43 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo."

12:44 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How are we doing in regards to progress on the way home?"

12:45 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "NDB is 12%."

12:45 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "12 percent on the NDB!"

12:45 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone remember what it is at Farport?"

12:47 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Should be around 70's I think."

12:47 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Two days time is my guess."

12:48 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Um two and a half at minimum rather."

12:48 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probably thursday noon to evening."

12:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:01 Lily Kaise lies back on a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

13:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:06 A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.

13:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:16 A nearby soldier carefully inspects his rifle to ensure it is ready.

13:17 An officer barks an order and a squad of soldiers climb over the trench wall and advance into the fray.

13:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:28 A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock rifle slung over his shoulder.

13:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:36 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

13:39 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

13:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:54 The ship's reactionless drive whirrs loudly as it changes direction rapidly.

14:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:09 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

14:14 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

14:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:24 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

14:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:34 Thuds echo throughout the ship as micrometeorites slam into the hull.

14:39 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

14:40 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

14:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

14:55 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

15:29 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

15:29 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

15:30 Lily Kaise stands up from a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it.

15:30 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a personal hoverpallet here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

15:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:39 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

15:41 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

15:41 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

15:45 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

15:45 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out.

15:45 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

15:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:56 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tail.

16:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

16:02 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly out.

16:11 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

16:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:21 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

16:24 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

16:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:34 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

16:35 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

16:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:42 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

16:43 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

16:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:55 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:56 Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

16:57 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

16:57 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

16:57 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

16:57 You blink heavily and then doze off.

17:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

17:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

17:12 The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.

17:23 The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and closing. It then abruptly swims off.

17:33 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

17:43 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

17:43 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

17:44 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

17:57 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I see planets."

18:06 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shouldn't stop for anything. We've got way bigger concerns."

18:06 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am not stopping."

18:07 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

18:17 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

18:17 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "All the tobacco pouches you can eat."

18:27 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

18:37 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

18:44 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

18:44 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

18:44 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

18:44 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

18:45 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

18:45 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

18:58 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

19:15 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

19:20 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

19:31 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

19:37 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

19:41 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

19:44 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

19:47 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

19:47 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

19:49 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

19:52 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

20:09 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

20:19 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

20:29 The grassy outcrop flies close to a snow-capped mountain range. Gentle flurries swirl around momentarily before the chunk veers away to warmer air.

20:37 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

20:47 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

20:48 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

20:48 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

21:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

21:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:15 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

21:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:25 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

21:35 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

21:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:46 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

21:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

21:49 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

21:50 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

21:50 Listen. You need to be careful.

21:55 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

21:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

22:00 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

22:03 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

22:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

22:17 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uh..."

22:17 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Something came up then isn't there?"

22:20 So much pain. For what?

22:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:21 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What was that? Something happened?"

22:30 There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that you are a failure.

22:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

22:34 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

22:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:44 So much pain. For what?

22:53 Remember what I said.

22:53 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

22:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:23 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

23:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

23:29 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

23:33 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

23:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:44 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

23:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:54 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

23:54 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

23:54 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.
