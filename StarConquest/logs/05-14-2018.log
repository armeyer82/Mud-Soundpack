02:16 Dear Mr. Elemmire,

Congratulations! We have decided to accept your application to purchase and operate an AW-2 AEU Flare-class Twin-Assault Vessel!

The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses had your application reviewed by the finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your service as a pilot. At the conclusion of this process, it was decided that you were well qualified to operate this equipment.

Thank you, and we hope you enjoy your new acquisition!

Sincerely,
The Alliance of Extrasolar Unions Board of Special Licenses

'More than a week ago, the current AEU administration decided, foolishly I might add, to allow the Rogue Navy to return home.
'First of all, this is highly insulting to those pilots both from the AEU, and from all other alliances who worked so hard to fight the Outsiders after the Rogue Navy's intentional acts against the very survival of humanity.
'I am of course, referring to the activation of a beacon in Mutuality space, which would reveal one of the last major holdouts that the Outsiders needed to begin systematically destroying all vestages of our race.
'Those elements of the Rogue navy who are returning to AEU-held territories should be tried for treason, at the very least, and be imprisoned for life as a result of their actions. We all have consciences. Those who did not believe in Kendra Janus's orders should have done something about them rather than act on them and commit treason not only against the AEU, but against humanity as a whole. Even their silence is inexcusable.
'This action is one of a series of poor actions by this administration. An administration that I might add, some of us hoped would do some good, after the disappointing Garner admininstration before it. Instead, it is only making poorer and poorer decisions.
'First and foremost, the civilian pilots of the AEU condemn the belief and words of President Best saying that Unregistered peoples are not considered humans. We are all humans, whether we're registered or unregistered.
'Additionally, we condemn the administration's actions for leaving the Accord, as well as attempting to privatize the AEU pilot corps.
'Things have been building up for a while with the civilian pilots. The allowing of the AEU navy back into AEU space however, has forced us to act in a manner we normally would never even consider.
'We refuse to consider the heartless, patetic individuals of the Rogue navy, who decided to hand over the fate of our entire species to a tyranical race as AEU citizens. In fact, if we are talking levels of humanity, every member of the Rogue Navy is less human than even the most ruthless of unregistered individuals.
'Therefore, today, we the civilian pilots of the AEU have decided that we will begin systematically targeting all AEU naval vessels for destruction. We see you, we will shoot you down.
'Hostilities will be initiated approximately twenty-four hours after this broadcast. In the meantime, we ask those of you on all AEU planets to rise up and fight against this administration. Especially those loyal members of the AEU navy who feel as strongly as we do about the decision to allow those traitoress members of the Rogue Navy back into the fold. You have twenty-four hours to decide if you are going to stay on the side which would allow traitors to your entire race back home without any punishments, or if you want to fight for what's right. Obviously, if yo
02:16 u're on our side, we will not be shooting you down.
'A note to all the other alliances, however. This is our fight. We ask you to not engage against any AEU forces in AEU sectors unless you are crewing on an AEU ship. There is no reason for anyone else to get involved.
'Additionally, we also ask you all to avoid all AEU sectors for the time being, if you have not done so already for your own safety, and to do your part to boycott all AEU stores and locations. Buy nothing that is sold by any AEU corporation or shop for the time being. This includes all starship upgrades and battlesuits.
'All questions can be directed to me. Bases of operation have already been established for staging points. If anyone wants to crew on any AEU warships they can make private inquiries regarding these bases of operation.
'This is a sad day for our alliance, my fellow citizens of the Union. A civil war is not what I had in mind, and is not at all what the civilian pilots wanted.
'However, if a civil war is the only thing that this administration is willing to listen to, then a civil war is exactly what they will have.
'I wish you all a good night.

Apartments are places that your character can rent and furnish to their liking. You will find several apartment buildings scattered across planets and space stations.

Apartments require an initial deposit, as well as rent paid once a month. This rent is due on the first day of every month. If your rent is more than two months overdue, you will lose access to your apartment and eventually be evicted.

RENTING AN APARTMENT

You can register for your apartment from any apartment lobby with the REGISTER command. This will offer you a selection of floors where you can place your apartment. Generally, each floor has a different apartment layout, so pay attention to how many bathrooms and other rooms you'll be getting, as well as extra features. Bigger apartments have higher rent, of course. You can only own one apartment in each apartment complex.

You also pay your rent in the lobby by simply using the RENT command.

If you wish to permanently move out of your apartment, use the MOVE command. Since you can only rent one apartment per building, you must do this if you wish to upgrade to a better apartment.

VISITING AN APARTMENT

If you're inside an apartment, you can type OPEN DOOR to allow others to enter freely. You'll want to close the door again afterwards, of course.

If you are visiting an apartment, you may use the BUZZ command in the lobby to let the residents know that you've arrived.

MANAGING OTHER RESIDENTS

You have two commands controlling who can freely enter your apartment: ALLOW and DISALLOW. They do about what you'd expect. You must use them while inside your apartment.

As the original renter of the apartment, you will always be responsible for its rent, no matter who else might be living there.

REPURPOSING ROOMS

You might have noticed that your new apartment is filled with a lot of empty rooms! You can fix this with the REPURPOSE command. This will change the room's name and default description, letting you lay out your apartment however you like.

Certain rooms cannot be moved, such as bathrooms. You are not a space plumber.

Furnishing is entirely up to you!

LUXURY FEATURES

Once your character is wealthy enough, you may end up renting a place at a luxury apartment complex or building. These places tend to have a few extra features:

* Restricted access: Most of the building is inaccessible to people who are not residents.
* Special rooms: Residents may enjoy a private pool, gym, lounge, or other features.
* Mail room: Residents may reroute their mail to a mail room inside the building.
* Self-storage: A self-storage room may be available to safely store your large items. Only residents of your apartment can access your self-storage unit.
* Concierge phone service: Check the lobby for a number for the front desk. The conc
02:41 ierge will let you pay your rent over the phone, or call a taxi to and from your building.

A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.
