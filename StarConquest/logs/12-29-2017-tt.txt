Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Dear Lily and Shule,
I need some help. I am struggling how to handle my reaction to people's
judgement and criticism and gossipping. It has stressed me out so much that I am
considering retiring. I mean, these people used to be my friends, but now that
I've closed up to them because of some tramatic event that happened to me, and
because they gave me a blow and gave me reasons not to trust them anymore, they
don't take it kindly. Instead I'm being judged and criticised for what I do,
sugarcoated when I'm with them, and being very discouraged. It's not making my
life as a pilot very enjoyable. It isn't fair, and I shouldn't feel the need to
retire because of childish gossipping people who deprive you of what you want to
do. To be frank I wish to know how you guy can stand to be around and stick
through things, and these people? I mean to be honest from hanging around with
my league mates you guys aren't very liked, but I just don't see why. Or maybe I
do. Maybe it's because it's the same reason why I'm on their ganging up on side.
Because I don't like to be controled by them or suck up to their faces.. I guess
I'm just looking for some encouragement or comfort, and a reason to stay. I'm
reaching out for help. I'm Katina, shy, hard to stand up for myself, and care
too much what people think. I don't want to retire, I love being a pilot, I just
wish people would leave me alone. I want to see the kind people around here, I
don't often see them. Only the drama stirer upper people. Please help me? I'm
asking to meet up with you guys and talk, or perhaps talk through exchanging
letters if you don't have the time or want to meet up and talk about it. I've
sent you both the same letter because I didn't know who to send the letter to.
sincerely,
Katina

Dear Lily and Shule,
I need some help. I am struggling how to handle my reaction to people's
judgement and criticism and gossipping. It has stressed me out so much that I am
considering retiring. I mean, these people used to be my friends, but now that
I've closed up to them because of some tramatic event that happened to me, and
because they gave me a blow and gave me reasons not to trust them anymore, they
don't take it kindly. Instead I'm being judged and criticised for what I do,
sugarcoated when I'm with them, and being very discouraged. It's not making my
life as a pilot very enjoyable. It isn't fair, and I shouldn't feel the need to
retire because of childish gossipping people who deprive you of what you want to
do. To be frank I wish to know how you guy can stand to be around and stick
through things, and these people? I mean to be honest from hanging around with
my league mates you guys aren't very liked, but I just don't see why. Or maybe I
do. Maybe it's because it's the same reason why I'm on their ganging up on side.
Because I don't like to be controled by them or suck up to their faces.. I guess
I'm just looking for some encouragement or comfort, and a reason to stay. I'm
reaching out for help. I'm Katina, shy, hard to stand up for myself, and care
too much what people think. I don't want to retire, I love being a pilot, I just
wish people would leave me alone. I want to see the kind people around here, I
don't often see them. Only the drama stirer upper people. Please help me? I'm
asking to meet up with you guys and talk, or perhaps talk through exchanging
letters if you don't have the time or want to meet up and talk about it. I've
sent you both the same letter because I didn't know who to send the letter to.
sincerely,
Katina

well."
-michael So are the Fringe going to disolve the pact too?
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I honestly believe some don't truly
understand the gravity of that action."
You say to Michael, "So are the Fringe going to disolve the pact too?"
Katina Faye says, "I don't think it was aimed at the pilots specificly, I think
we dissolved the pacts to send a message to Best more."
'Rihgt, and it's the pilots that face the consequences.
You say, "Rihgt, and it's the pilots that face the consequences."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'yeah but you all are hurting us."

Lily says to Katina, "So which battery are the League going to use in place of

'And did they lose access to the Jackrabbit?
You ask, "And did they lose access to the Jackrabbit?"
Katina Faye says, "Yeah I was outvoted. I voted for the friendly vote. But each
vote had it's consequence to try and get a message across that withdrawing from
accord was a bad idea."
'But that's already been done. There's nothing that can be done about that. Our
government made that very clear to us.
You say, "But that's already been done. There's nothing that can be done about
that. Our government made that very clear to us."
Michael Kennedy nods.
Katina Faye says, "Honestly my vote didn't matter because if the friendly vote
won, they would have ramped up to dissolving the pact anyways if there was no
change with in your alliance in 60 days."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well I don't really think they care as
much about the JackRabbit though I've seen many League ships with the other
Grid."
Michael Kennedy says, "Sadly we fringe cant even get revo, government has been
slow to respond about barnams."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh wow."

were judging."

couldn't hear them. Isn't that judging and gossiping or not?"

Katina Faye says, "And if Melinda has a problem with somebody, she calls them
out over alliance where all her face sucker uppers can gang up on me, or

"Yeah, she does do that." You nod to Katina Faye. "She did that to Lily too."

You chuckle at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Michael Kennedy says, "From them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Shule is his own man."
Katina Faye says, "I mean if we had the proper chance to withstand against them,
I think it could be more durrable but that's not really possible when they're
all kids and attention hores and they all suck up to Melinda or a popular
figure."
'I'm sure. Doesn't surprise me.
You say, "I'm sure. Doesn't surprise me."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Melinda obviously didn't hear what she
wanted."
Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I had absolutely no problem with the delay.
In fact I was releived as we did have our issues to deal with here."
Katina Faye says, "I used to be on their bandwagon till I started seeing the
cracks in the walls. They'd say stuff about you guys that I found hard to
believe. And others. And the more I saw the more I realized, and then they did
it to me, so I was like no, I can't do this. And so I closed up to them, and now
I'm one of their favorite topics to talk about when they're sitting in the
lounge sweating their butts."
Katina Faye says, "Because I defy them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
nod katina
You nod to Katina Faye.
Katina Faye says, "And they don't like it."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Oh I'm sure!"
Katina laughs quietly.
Katina Faye says, "And I feel a little bad talking shit about my own league
mates but it's not shit, it's true, so I shouldn't be sorry."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think we can get around not having a suit
to lead in. It won't be easy but i've given it some thought."
'YEah, repairing with that armor sure works!
You exclaim, "YEah, repairing with that armor sure works!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

'YEah, Ali has always been nice to me.
You say, "YEah, Ali has always been nice to me."
Katina Faye says, "Because it strokes their ego."
Katina Faye asks, "So as I asked in your letter, how do you deal with all of
this? Normally I have a soft heart, but I've been frustrated and bitter and
angry lately. How do I not let them get to me?"
'Honestly? I just surround myself with the people who can be positive. Forget
everyone else.
You say, "Honestly? I just surround myself with the people who can be positive.

You say, "And second, my love for Lily keeps me going."
Katina Faye says, "The second is luckily more in favor for me too."

You nod to Katina Faye. "I know."
Katina gives Michael a tender smile.
Lily says to Katina, "Well as I told you before, it does bother me and Shule
knows my true feelings but I was taught to be tough from my upbringing."
Michael smiles encouragingly at Katina.
'And believe me, I've had my angry moments.
You say, "And believe me, I've had my angry moments."
Katina nods softly. "Well, I wish I didn't care what they say. But they know I

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah can you believe when I was between
when I left Starseekers and forming SEAS that I actually wanted to be part of
Cats? Not now."
-lily Oh dear. You would have lasted... what? two days?
You say to Lily, "Oh dear. You would have lasted... what? two days?"
Katina Faye says, "It's this whole elitism. You suck up to our face, your stroke
our ego, you get access to charting. You do things your own ways, we'll call you
stupid and jump on you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I actually could chart at one time."
Katina Faye says, "And you'll be lmitted on what you can do as a pilot."

times how he can't stand lilly. But I've told him I don't see what's so wrong
with them. They've been nice to me the times I've known them, and Shule stood up
for me when Vernos was not being nice that one time when I was a cadet."

A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.
Katina Faye says, "Erik just says he likes to eat popcorn and watch the drama
unfold, and he likes to stick a hand in every now and then to stir up the drama,
but as long as he's not caught up in the drama, he enjoys it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure."
Katina Faye says, "He said that over the org channel."
'Whatever, he's just as much part of it.
You say, "Whatever, he's just as much part of it."

Michael Kennedy says, "So."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He wouldn' put SEAS on the Asteroid
processor in 288 and I don't know why Melinda didn't tell him he was required
to."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "She didn't stand up to him."
Katina says to Lily, "Because Erik sucks up to her face so she doesn't care to
and lets it slide."
Michael Kennedy says, "My friend jada and I, were going GMG, we've known each
other for a bit, so we're just ok friends, morris knew this, he was on the
landing pad and saw it all, but."

Shule turns and listens to Michael.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Michael Kennedy.
Michael Kennedy says, "So when katina woke up, he asked her, but I thought you
went GMG with michael, in a way to suggest that I went GMG, but not with her, he
wanted to imply that I went GMG with another woman, and I didn't want katina to
know."

I am with, and she likewise."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I might go out there with him now if I have
time but i'm not at work as much anymore so even if Shule and I could go across
the skim, I don't know when we would."
Katina Faye says, "Because I trust Michael and we're too close for anybody to
turn us on each other. But my nonchalant answer wasn't what Morris was
expecting. He was expecting me to flake out. So his reaction of miftness made me
giggle inside."
'Just because two people go to GMg with each other doesn't mean they're dating.
You say, "Just because two people go to GMG with each other doesn't mean they're
dating."

to pop you cross the skim just call me, my number on the registry, and I can
give you it as well, I'd be happy to."

You say to Katina, "What did Morris say that caused that?"
Lily says to Michael, "Ok so let's see."

Subject: New Years Outfit Auction!
Author: Tanny Hill
Posted: 07:36 31 December 2317 GST

So I'm gonna try my goodest to be at the party, but I do not yet have a getup.
So, I will let the highest bidder put together an outfit for me to wear to NQ.
The outfit does have to have clothes involved (where's the fun if there's
nothing to take off?) but can be as layered as you wish and may involve paint
and the like. Proceeds will go towards the League reconstruction fund, and I'll
even match the highest bidder's donation. Reply to this post to make a bid!
Bidding starts at 50 million League credits.
