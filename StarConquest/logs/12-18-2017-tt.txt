Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!
This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However,
we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make
sure everyone gets a gift!
First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within
the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and
celebration a little closer to the holiday!
Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes
for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that
already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action
figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos, custom hair styles, small "plastic
surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest
selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details
for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much,
please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to
add additional lines of text!
Thank you!

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and Cheri-Pye

Lily Kaise laughs.
The one-person fighter "Gonna Clean Yer Clock" rises smoothly off the ground and
accelerates rapidly toward space.
Melinda Michaels grins.
Lily Kaise exclaims, "He cracks me up totally!"
Nissi says to Lily, "How do you guys feel about this?"
Melinda says to Lily, "Can you land at Accord?"
Elaine Moreau says into her black metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I'm
impressed, honestly. Figured they'd try to make use of Accord services despite
pulling out. But they're actually pulling their own weight. So far."
Lily Kaise says, "Haven't tried yet."
Lily Kaise says, "But I have a ship or two over there so hope I can at least get
it."

Lily Kaise tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.
Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Test

Elaine Moreau says into her black metachannel FTL communicator and watch,
"Because they also need a base to operate from? But not neutral because they're
just one alliance."
Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Let

Lily says to Melinda, "Heh you explained it to him gotta feed him the facts!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Melinda Michaels grins at Lily Kaise.
Elaine Moreau says into her black metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "It's

Elaine Moreau says into her black metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Yes,
well, we're more badass than most."
Lily Kaise says, "So we do have 'Recovery Missions over here."
Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Most

Melinda Michaels grins at Elaine Moreau.
You say, "And combat."
Lily Kaise nods.
Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "My
guess is all this is gonna end very badly."
Elaine Moreau says into her black metachannel FTL communicator and watch,
"Nobody's happy about outccord, but having a dedicated, centralized location for
space defense and operations makes sense and I'm glad they aren't trying to
still leech off the Accord after leaving."
Lily says to you, "So should we go see if we can get those ships?"

You say to Lily, "Sure."

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another

[Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four]
This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened
metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow
lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate
where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent
atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One of the EMMs
is emitting a steady hum, indicating that it should be replaced. A ramp leads up
to the rest of the station.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
