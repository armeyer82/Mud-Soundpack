00:03:04 You nod.

00:03:08 You scramble to your feet.

00:03:09 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

00:03:10 The reactionless drive of the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" begins to hum slightly as the starship is powered up.

00:03:15 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

00:03:15 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:03:16 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:03:16 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:03:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:03:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:03:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:03:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:03:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:03:33 Starships In Sector:

00:03:33 
William Dove............................(19, 3, 9)
The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:03:37 "torrus" does not match any known sector.

00:03:38 The computer reports that the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" has jumped out of the sector.

00:03:41 Which sector did you mean?

00:03:41 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

00:03:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:03:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:03:42 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

00:03:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:03:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:03:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:03:49 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:03:49 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

00:03:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:03:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:03:54 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:03:56 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 778" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be 'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a special application in character generation.

The following is a listing of current and former (player character) pilots holding ace or veteran status.

00:23:28 
At least one recently active pilot is relaxing at New Earth; Pilot Lounge.
The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:23:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:23:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:23:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:23:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:23:35 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:23:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:24:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:24:11 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:24:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:24:33 You peer into a transparisteel doorway into the pilot lounge...

00:24:33 
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Tara Flores is standing here.
You can go out.

00:24:39 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

00:24:39 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.

00:24:41 You wave to Tara Flores.

00:24:59 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:25:30 You say to Tara, "How's it going?"

00:26:11 Tara Flores

00:26:11 She appears to be 22 years old. She is about five feet and three inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and average-sized breasts. Her face is round and girlish, with a button nose and sharp chin. Her lips are soft and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of thin eyebrows, her eyes are green and round. Her shoulder-length, wispy hair is pale honey blonde and hanging in a smooth fall with short, wispy bangs. She has a past injury on her right cheek.
 She is wearing a navy blue flight jacket, a navy blue flightsuit, a pair of dark brown gunnery gloves, a black utility belt, and a pair of dark blue leather boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, a navy blue canvas gear bag, a silver-toned engineering tool case, a plain touch einrophone in a dark gray leather phone holster, and a bulky asteroid supply cannon. Her head, face, both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.
She is carrying a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak in her right hand.

00:26:27 Tara waves to you "Its going good, just taking a break. Hauled in ten asteroids today."

00:26:33 Tara Flores sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

00:26:36 Tara Flores takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:26:55 "Nice!" You grin at Tara Flores.

00:27:08 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Next You'll Be Wanting Me To Name The Debris Too". The organization has earned 1,386,185.67 credits.

00:28:09 Tara Flores nods.

00:28:30 Tara Flores says, "I only need to get that air lock cycler upgrade Dakhal talked about and I should be all equiped for roiding."

00:28:38 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

00:28:47 You need a free hand to take that.

00:28:54 You are carrying a secondary pilot command access unit in your right hand, and a metallic gold touch einrophone in your left hand.

00:28:59 You place a metallic gold touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

00:29:06 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

00:30:46 You give an enhanced starship gaseous exchange pump unit to Tara Flores.

00:30:49 You pick up Shule Elemmire's workbench.

00:30:52 You put Shule Elemmire's workbench in a leather briefcase.

00:31:00 Tara Flores asks, "Oh. Thanks! How much are these worth?"

00:31:12 Tara Flores puts an enhanced starship gaseous exchange pump unit in a navy blue canvas gear bag.

00:31:23 You say to Tara, "Don't worry about it."

00:31:31 You say to Tara, "It's a gift."

00:31:43 Tara says to you, "Aauugh! You spoil me you know."

00:31:44 Tara Flores laughs.

00:31:55 You laugh.

00:32:04 Tara Flores orders a glass of fizzy cola.

00:32:10 Tara Flores says, "At least let me buy you a drink."

00:32:12 Tara Flores gives you a glass of fizzy cola.

00:32:18 You grin. "That works. Thanks."

00:32:23 You take a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

00:32:38 You take a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

00:32:38 Tara Flores takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:32:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Well, I finally have my first ship. Hopefully my first flight will not be a complete disaster."

00:32:46 You take a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

00:32:47 You take a sip of a glass of fizzy cola.

00:32:50 You finish off a glass of fizzy cola.

00:32:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You'll be fine."

00:33:09 Tara Flores speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

00:33:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Learn by doing is basically how i've figured things out since I started as acadet."

00:33:19 You put a glass in a shiny chrome trash bin.

00:33:23 You smile at Tara Flores.

00:33:27 You say to Tara, "Thanks."

00:33:38 Tara Flores nods to you.

00:33:50 Tara Flores says, "YOu can drink cola fast. My throat would burn."

00:33:55 You laugh.

00:34:25 You say, "I eat and drink quickly. I'm usually in my ship going from one thingg to another when I'm eating or drinking."

00:35:12 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

00:35:16 Tara Flores says, "I like to savor my food and drink, so I take some time."

00:35:21 You say to Tara, "But I will take you out in the Flare at some point."

00:35:29 Tara Flores speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

00:35:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Good luck, ALdis! Don't get shot."

00:35:49 Tara says to you, "Will have to wait a while. I doubt the outsiders will fall for any more beacons with me around for a while."

00:36:00 You say, "Yeah."

00:36:03 You say, "Me too."

00:36:11 Tara Flores exclaims, "Goodness though!"

00:36:20 Tara Flores asks, "I did a very low power beacon in my fighter, right?"

00:36:25 You nod.

00:36:29 You exclaim, "That's awesome!"

00:36:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "If need be, I'll simply make a run for it. I need to get used to how my new ship performs first."

00:36:33 Tara Flores says, "Lone outsider fighter arrived, and it took nearly all of my torpedo ammunition to kill it."

00:36:51 You say, "Yeah, that can happen, but at least you won."

00:37:03 Tara Flores speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

00:37:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, the first beacon I dd was a low, and a corvette showed up."

00:37:09 Tara Flores says, "Oops."

00:37:10 Tara Flores laughs.

00:37:13 You laugh.

00:37:16 You say, "It's ok."

00:37:17 Tara Flores speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

00:37:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Miscomm."

00:37:27 Tara Flores says, "I nearly took it out."

00:37:31 You grin.

00:37:33 Tara Flores says, "BUt im not the best at evading yet."

00:37:38 A seagull flaps by the window.

00:37:44 You say, "Mopve, aim fire."

00:37:46 Tara Flores says, "It knocked out all my weapons, and sensors, and worm hole drive."

00:37:49 You say, "Er, move aim fire."

00:38:00 Tara Flores says, "And it had chained me."

00:38:09 You say, "Yeah, chains are annoying."

00:38:22 Tara Flores says, "For a while I had to aquire targets through visual confirmaton because my torpedo launcher was still functioning, but my sensors weren't."

00:38:30 You say, "Wow."

00:38:45 Tara Flores says, "I lasted a good thirty minutes? Then I had constantine come help."

00:38:46 You say, "I can help you practice."

00:39:11 Tara Flores says, "We took it out, brought trinaos back for repiar, went back and made quick work of a corvette and fighter together."

00:39:13 Tara Flores nods to you.

00:39:15 Tara Flores says, "I need it."

00:39:21 You grin.

00:39:38 A seagull flaps by the window.

00:41:23 You say, "I did too when I first started out."

00:41:32 You say, "I needed lots of practice."

00:41:37 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

00:42:02 Tara Flores says, "Thirty five million credits from hauling. Not bad."

00:42:08 You exclaim, "Nice!"

00:42:21 Tara Flores says, "Salvaging in 777 gives way more points, though."

00:42:25 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

00:42:32 You nod.

00:42:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just arrived.

00:42:50 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:42:50 Tara Flores says, "Oh. Can you take a look at Trinaos's loadout? I want your opinon on it."

00:42:53 Tara Flores waves to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:42:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly bashes her spacesuit helmet into your face.

00:43:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops."

00:43:04 Tara blinks.

00:43:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:43:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

00:43:14 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:43:17 You laugh.

00:43:22 You say to Lily, "Ouch!"

00:43:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Tara Flores.

00:43:51 Tara says to Lily, "Hi, Lily. How's it going?"

00:44:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Going well!"

00:44:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:44:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

00:45:00 You say to Tara, "And youthought I ate and drank quickly."

00:45:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:45:06 You grin.

00:45:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "He does!"

00:45:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

00:45:18 You say, "Asteria has me beat though."

00:45:27 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

00:45:58 Tara Flores laughs.

00:46:07 Tara Flores says, "Those Lizards are awesome."

00:46:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Men just aren't into enjoying the finer things like a good meal."

00:46:14 Tara Flores takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:46:21 You say, "Yeah they are."

00:46:36 Lily glances sideways at Shule and laughs.

00:46:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:46:42 You chuckle at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:46:44 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

00:46:50 Tara Flores asks, "Anyway, want to check my fighter's loadout out?"

00:47:47 [General Communication] "Damien and Eve?" Melinda Michaels whistles.

00:47:52 Tara says to Lily, "Want to come along?"

00:48:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nice work y'all."

00:48:22 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You two do make a cute couple but tell us what happened."

00:48:30 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Come with us."

00:48:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

00:48:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "It's ok i'm sure it won't ttake long for him to review your status report?"

00:49:26 Tara says to you, "I'm not going to go around telling the masses what happened on general chat but eve and Damien were in here encouraging me to keep doing what I do, and not let people on the chat get to me."

00:49:46 Tara Flores nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:49:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well that is what I also said."

00:49:51 Tara Flores says, "Alright, we'll be back."

00:49:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:50:01 Tara Flores scrambles to her feet.

00:50:01 You follow Tara Flores out.

00:51:23 You say, "Ah, ok."

00:51:44 Tara Flores asks, "So how's this for a fighter setup?"

00:52:03 You say, "You know, what I would recommend for beacons is to rent a fighter. It's ok, but it's pretty close to stock upgrades."

00:52:19 You say, "And you need the databases from the Torus."

00:52:31 Tara Flores says, "That's what I was going to get next."

00:52:33 You follow Tara Flores out.

00:52:33 [Starship "Trinaos"; Airlock]
Tara Flores is standing here.

00:52:40 You grin.

00:52:48 You follow Tara Flores into a transparisteel doorway into the pilot lounge.

00:52:48 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, Patriot Dakhal Araegin, and Tara Flores are standing here.
You can go out.

00:52:49 Patriot Dakhal Araegin glances around at his surroundings.

00:52:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances at Patriot Dakhal Araegin.

00:52:56 Tara Flores disbands her group.

00:53:01 You grin.

00:53:15 Tara Flores says to Dakhal, "Hey look, its the patriot that's worse than Vernos!"

00:53:20 Lily says to Dakhal, "Actually they walked out as I said what I said and the answer is no."

00:53:21 Tara Flores rolls her eyes.

00:53:25 You say to Tara, "I'd really recommend renting a short-term fighter."

00:53:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:53:26 Patriot Dakhal Araegin chuckles at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:53:38 Dakhal says to Tara, "Why, yes, I am worse than Vernos. Nice to meet you."

00:53:40 Tara says to you, "Don't they lack a hyperdrive though?"

00:53:46 Patriot Dakhal Araegin says, "Now, excuse me while I sell out my fellow pilots."

00:53:47 Tara says to Dakhal, "But you aren't."

00:54:04 Tara says to you, "Jump drive, I mean."

00:54:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup rentals are a good way to go when just starting out as if you lose it, you'll not make the rental guy happy but it doesn't affect our ship losses."

00:54:17 "The short-term fighters have an ftl drive." You shake your head at Tara Flores. "Go to Tannhauser gate."

00:54:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

00:55:02 Tara Flores says, "I'll have to check it out."

00:55:06 You grin.

00:55:27 Tara Flores says, "I just have a sort of attachment to trinaos, SHe's my first fighter and she's gone through some pretty crazy fights now."

00:55:28 You say, "You can rent them for about an hour."

00:55:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

00:55:38 You nod to Tara Flores.

00:55:41 You say, "I understand."

00:55:47 Patriot Dakhal Araegin takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

00:55:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well save it for when you're a tad more experienced."

00:55:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

00:55:54 You grin.

00:55:58 Tara Flores finishes off a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:56:03 You wave to Patriot Dakhal Araegin.

00:56:16 Tara says to Dakhal, "SPeaking of. Rematch in the sims sometime?"

00:56:36 Dakhal says to Tara, "Maybe? I've been pretty busy lately."

00:56:48 Patriot Dakhal Araegin waves to you.

00:57:01 Tara says to Dakhal, "Oh, your term start soon doesn't it? Have any plan for it?"

00:57:26 You say, "Read lots of reports and give lots of updates."

00:57:30 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the vostok-class capsule "Ain't Lolly Gaggin'" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

00:57:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

00:57:33 You grin.

00:57:34 Patriot Dakhal Araegin nods to you.

00:57:43 Morris Corlew just arrived.

00:57:48 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

00:57:50 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the vostok-class capsule "Peregrine Falcon" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

00:57:56 Morris Corlew orders a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:58:00 Melinda Michaels just arrived.

00:58:00 Morris Corlew nods to a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak for some reason.

00:58:05 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:58:05 You wave to Morris Corlew.

00:58:07 Melinda Michaels waves.

00:58:07 Patriot Dakhal Araegin takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

00:58:08 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

00:58:09 Morris Corlew waves.

00:58:12 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey there."

00:58:17 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the three-person stalwart "Red In Tooth And Claw" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

00:58:28 Lily says to Dakhal, "Give the terminal in there a good examination as there is informaiton and then just look over the options there and there will probably be a pile of old reports on the desk."

00:58:41 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Hawthorne's Gyrfalcon" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

00:58:46 Melinda says to Tara, "You must be the roid hauler?"

00:58:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Melinda Michaels.

00:58:48 Dakhal says to Lily, "I'm sure that there will be, given how it's been in decadence for some time."

00:58:49 Tobias Hawthorne just arrived.

00:58:52 Waves to TaraMelinda "Hello."

00:58:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

00:58:53 Nissi Valdaire just arrived.

00:58:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Nissi Valdaire.

00:59:00 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Hey!"

00:59:01 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

00:59:01 Tara Flores says, "I only started roid hauling today."

00:59:04 You wave to Tobias Hawthorne.

00:59:08 Melinda Michaels asks, "So, where's the Fringe power couple?"

00:59:10 Melinda Michaels chuckles.

00:59:14 Morris Corlew grins.

00:59:15 Tara Flores shrugs.
You chuckle.

00:59:25 Lily says to Nissi, "Hey-nissi where we cruising to?"

00:59:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:59:29 Melinda says to Tara, "I roid hauled for awhile when I was getting started."

00:59:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Like a day."

00:59:38 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

00:59:39 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

00:59:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "I dunno. It's an invasion apparently."

00:59:47 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

00:59:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "Gotta go where the party is."

00:59:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Oh ther is?"

00:59:53 Morris Corlew says, "Mmhmm."

00:59:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

00:59:59 Tara says to Melinda, "Hauling is pretty lax. I think the most enjoyable industry activity for me is mining sites, with salvaging right behind it."

01:00:01 Morris Corlew says, "Where the turnovers are."

01:00:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident switches a flight control scanner on.

01:00:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs at a flight control scanner.

01:00:22 Melinda says to Tara, "I will agree there. I like mining best of the industry work."

01:00:23 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Lily loves minin. She can probably help ya out."

01:00:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs at Melinda Michaels.

01:00:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

01:00:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident switches a flight control scanner off.

01:00:42 Tara Flores says, "Theres something fun about watching those drones get to work."

01:00:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:00:55 Morris Corlew nods. "That's what I was doin when I saw the party gatherin."

01:00:59 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

01:01:02 Melinda says to Lily, "So, what's the scoop with the Fringe power couple. I didn't know they had one."

01:01:09 You chuckle.

01:01:12 Lily says to Melinda, "No idea!"

01:01:20 Lily says to Melinda, "Maybe Tara knows?"

01:01:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Well, my first flight was not a failure at all. Thankfully. I was afraid the grapple would break on me."

01:01:38 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

01:01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Glad to hear that."

01:01:41 Melinda says to Lily, "Probably but I didn't want to bother the new pilot."

01:01:43 Melinda Michaels grins.

01:01:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:01:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Naa those grapples are sturdy."

01:01:57 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:02:02 Nissi Valdaire says, "Oh yeah, mining. I did a ton of that early on."

01:02:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

01:02:09 Nissi Valdaire says, "Mining and trading were how I made all my money."

01:02:11 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

01:02:13 [MTTS] blindbat84: Oh very nice new ambiance in the New Earth lounge.

01:02:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

01:02:33 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

01:02:33 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch. Patriot Dakhal Araegin, Tara Flores, Morris Corlew, Melinda Michaels, Tobias Hawthorne, and Nissi Valdaire are standing here.
You can go out.

01:02:38 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

01:02:46 Tara Flores says, "I've wanted to try trading, but spending the time to figure out routes seems like a waste when I can just sit down for two hours and command drones like im some sort a drone army commander."

01:02:48 Tara Flores chuckles.

01:02:51 [MTTS] usfolks: Probably more accurate than the heated political debates. I love it.

01:02:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:02:56 Nissi Valdaire nods.

01:03:17 Nissi Valdaire says, "I was gonna give you a hint then I remembered the skim access thing."

01:03:19 Nissi Valdaire gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

01:03:20 You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.

01:03:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I'd get caught out trading something where i'm not supposed to so I am leary of trading."

01:03:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:03:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well without the skim, the best trading would be contraband."

01:03:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:03:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

01:03:45 Melinda Michaels says, "Which, I have never ever done."

01:03:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So my only trading was way out there."

01:04:09 Nissi Valdaire says, "But if you do get access back, start at the Mutuality stations. Some good routes trading with them."

01:04:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And running some suppies to the Children of the Sun."

01:04:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Supplies."

01:04:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah it seemed so when I could still trade with them."

01:04:38 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

01:04:47 Tobias Hawthorne stalks out.

01:04:57 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

01:05:01 Melinda says to Tara, "So, is Eve the power couple? I really have a reason for wanting to know other than just to know."

01:05:08 Tobias Hawthorne just arrived.

01:05:27 Tobias Hawthorne orders a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural mango juice.

01:05:34 Morris Corlew takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

01:05:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a piping hot turnover filled with meatball.

01:06:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a piping hot turnover filled with meatball in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

01:06:05 Tara says to Melinda, "I'm not even sure. I mean she was here encouraging me to do what I do as a pilot and not to let people on the general channel get me down. Then that news thing popped up."

01:06:06 Tara Flores shrugs.

01:06:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a hot cup of espresso.

01:06:25 Tara Flores says, "Quite litereally ten minutes after she left."

01:06:31 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:06:38 A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the steaming beverage.

01:06:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

01:06:45 Tara Flores asks, "News travels fast?"

01:06:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yup amongst pilots!"

01:06:57 Morris Corlew says, "In the corps, faster than a PWD."

01:06:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:07:04 Melinda says to Tara, "Ah ha, it was then. Funny thing is, when Eli is around she encourages him to do what he is doing. Now she is encouraging to do what is against what he does. So, my advice to you is, watch that one."

01:07:14 Patriot Dakhal Araegin takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with pepperoni and cheese.

01:07:23 Morris Corlew finishes off a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.

01:07:29 Morris dusts his hands.

01:08:23 Tobias Hawthorne twists off the cap from his bottle of water, pockets it and sips at it slowly, leaning back against the bar.

01:08:29 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

01:09:38 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

01:09:43 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:09:44 Tara says to Melinda, "No, I don't think that's what it was about."

01:09:48 Patriot Dakhal Araegin strides out.

01:09:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs at a metallic gold touch einrophone.
Tobias Hawthorne navigates his golden brown slider einrophone to a news application.

01:10:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:10:38 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

01:10:40 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

01:10:45 Morris Corlew exclaims, "Miss Nina'll be so proud!"

01:11:02 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person fighter "The Claw" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

01:11:13 Tara Flores says, "But no really, she was just trying to encourage me. It had nothing to do with the politics of whats going on."

01:11:24 Morris Corlew blinks.

01:11:27 Melinda Michaels grins at Tara Flores. "You will see."

01:11:52 Melinda says to Tara, "Anyway, it is nice to meet you in person and hey, if you want to work, work."

01:12:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:12:15 You say to Melinda, "Nice to meet you in person too."

01:12:18 Tara Flores asks, "I'm too new of a pilot to not work. I became a pilot for a reason. Why would I sit on my butt and do nothing so early in my career?"

01:12:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:12:20 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah. People are just frustrated cuz they don't wanna see this Outccord thing happen. Erik especially is a little too worked up about it."

01:12:25 Morris Corlew chuckles at you.

01:12:30 Tara says to Melinda, "Nice to meet you though!"

01:12:33 Lily says to Melinda, "Yeah nice to finally meet you... again!"

01:12:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

01:12:38 Melinda says to you, "I"ll let ya know if it's nice to meet you or not later."

01:12:39 You chuckle at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:12:41 Melinda Michaels grins.

01:12:48 Tobias Hawthorne takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural mango juice.

01:12:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

01:13:11 Morris Corlew orders a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice.

01:13:14 Nissi Valdaire says, "I mean it will definitely happen if nobody tries to stop it, but I think that ship has already sailed. So work away."

01:13:19 Morris pops the top off a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice.

01:13:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Unfortunately, it probably has sailed."

01:13:32 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the augmented explorer "Oracle" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

01:13:42 Tobias Hawthorne says, "Pretty good chance of it."

01:13:44 Morris Corlew says, "It'd take a heck of a lot to stop that train now."

01:13:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

01:13:53 Aisling just arrived.

01:13:54 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

01:13:55 Morris tosses a bottle cap in a shiny chrome trash bin.

01:13:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

01:13:57 You nod to Morris Corlew.

01:14:04 You wave to Aisling.

01:14:11 Morris Corlew says, "And while there are things that can stop trains..."

01:14:15 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice.

01:14:17 Waves to TaraAisling and nods "Hello!"

01:14:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

01:14:47 Aisling asks, "What is everyone doing here, of all places?"

01:14:52 Morris Corlew taps a metallic silver touch einrophone.

01:14:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're doing."

01:14:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:14:59 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

01:15:40 Morris says to Aisling, "There was a party. And...we wanted to...read the news together. And things. And eat turnovers."

01:15:45 Melinda says to Aisling, "We wanted to see the new power couple."

01:15:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "I wanted to say earlier too, there's usually somebody willing to run out and scare off Ares, but don't let their plinky little lasers fool you. Most ships can take those out. Even had transports and asteroid haulers fight em off. It's good practice if you've got the time."

01:15:47 Melinda Michaels giggles.

01:15:51 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

01:15:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just watch your damage if you try it."

01:15:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:16:06 You nod.

01:16:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You can always get away too."

01:16:15 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah that too."

01:16:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or just go up in the watch towar and pew pew."

01:16:29 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:16:31 Morris Corlew says, "Yep. If you're roid haulin out there, ya ain't gotta worry bout not bein able to land. They generally get bored and leave fairly quickly."

01:16:32 You grin.

01:16:38 Tara Flores says, "I only got weaker lasers on my hauler right now, so I didn't really want to sit around for while shooting them."

01:16:38 Morris says to Lily, "No watchtower at the moment."

01:16:41 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

01:16:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

01:16:52 Melinda Michaels asks, "Is the watch tower up out there?"

01:16:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well there's generally one."

01:17:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

01:17:04 Tara Flores says, "Nope. I didn't see one."

01:17:04 Morris says to Lily, "The stations out there are kinda whopperjawed and I'm tryin to get 'em worked out."

01:17:06 Morris says to Melinda, "No."

01:17:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:17:21 Aisling asks, "Whopperjawed?"

01:17:28 Aisling says, "You are just making shite up now."

01:17:30 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling. "Outta allignment."

01:17:34 Lily says to Melinda, "Please get Joel to put a stealth sheathing on Joy Ride. I can't use his cores."

01:17:57 Tara Flores says, "I upgraded my haulers hull plating though. Those lasers might have range but they barely scorched my hull."

01:18:02 Melinda says to Lily, "My ship is not his spare parts ship. If he does not give you parts, screw it and leave him out."

01:18:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup tht's what happens."

01:18:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

01:18:34 Morris says to Aisling, "Hmm...Kattywampus then?"

01:18:37 Melinda says to Lily, "If you find a part of his on my ship, you are welcome to use it but yeah. They overloaded my ship once and I got after them."

01:18:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:18:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:18:50 Aisling stares blankly at Morris.

01:18:57 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

01:19:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well he's put a few cores on but I use Nicolette's for the Asteroid Processor so yeah."

01:19:29 Tobias says to Morris, "Thrown together from the parts you could cobble together, pretty much is the point?"

01:19:41 A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back out.

01:19:51 Morris says to Tobias, "No...outta whack...crooked...outta allignment. Off-kilter uh..."

01:19:53 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:19:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:20:02 You chuckle.

01:20:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just discombobulated."

01:20:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:20:13 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Exactly."

01:20:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Like who is on..."

01:20:21 Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:20:25 Morris Corlew laughs.

01:20:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

01:20:33 You grin.

01:20:35 Tobias Hawthorne takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural mango juice.

01:20:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident finishes off a hot cup of espresso.

01:20:43 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

01:20:44 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. Eve had Constantine do it and didn't give him any instruction."

01:20:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a cup in a shiny chrome trash bin.

01:20:50 Morris Corlew says, "Or a book apparently."

01:21:00 Tobias Hawthorne says, "That book is a lifesaver."

01:21:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh that book was out of date 2 days after published though."

01:21:23 Morris says to Lily, "Not that bad."

01:21:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "New orgs come along and then people change responsibilities and so on."

01:21:33 Morris Corlew says, "So the beacon has waaaay longer than the accelerator and there was no watchtower as it was, and I'm tryin to get the timin back set up."

01:21:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:21:40 A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back out.

01:21:42 Melinda Michaels says, "The book isn't really out of date."

01:21:52 Morris Corlew says, "It ain't. Only things different in it are the autonavs."

01:21:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't think SEAS is in there heh."

01:22:03 Morris says to Lily, "Seas ain't gotta be in there."

01:22:08 Tara Flores says, "Parts parts.. I'm having trouble following what you guys are talking about."

01:22:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Unless a revision occurred since I bought one."

01:22:25 Morris says to Lily, "Y'all are on our parts. So why wouldja need to be in there?"

01:22:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because we build the Asteroid Processor."

01:22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Uh oh. I jumped back towards the Dusty Reaches, and there are RATs here this time."

01:22:43 Morris says to Lily, "I think that's in there."

01:22:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

01:23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, they like that place."

01:23:09 Melinda says to Tara, "We build temp stations for hauling, beacons and industry work."

01:23:21 Tara says to Melinda, "Oh! Temp stations. I understand now."

01:23:31 Morris Corlew says, "285 is possible 'cause of temp stations...and them's the ones we're talkin bout."

01:23:31 You say, "Be right back."

01:23:32 Melinda Michaels nods.

01:23:32 You scramble to your feet.

01:23:33 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The one-person fighter "Trinaos", the three-person stalwart "Red In Tooth And Claw", and the augmented explorer "Oracle" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

01:23:34 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

01:23:34 You can go up.

01:23:36 Board what?

01:23:37 Board what?

01:23:41 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

01:23:41 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:23:42 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:23:42 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:23:43 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:23:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:23:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll make my way there shortly."

01:23:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:23:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:23:56 The ship is already moving.

01:23:59 The ship is already moving.

01:23:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:24:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Dusty Reaches. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:24:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:24:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

01:24:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:24:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:24:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:24:08 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

01:24:11 Via general sector communication, Beacon C-09 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Deadly Strike.' Welcome to The Dusty Reaches."

01:43:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "This is true."

01:43:51 Tobias Hawthorne says, "I appreciate nature, just not some of it that flocks. Some of the gulls back home had no fear, would steal a hotdog out of your hand if you weren't careful."

01:44:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah they will!"

01:44:02 Morris Corlew grins.

01:44:10 Morris Corlew says, "I had a deer do that once."

01:44:11 Melinda Michaels grins. "They have to eat too."

01:44:11 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

01:44:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I guess that's why we can't feed them on our beach?"

01:44:41 You hear someone happily recount a recent asteroid mining victory.

01:44:42 You say to Morris, "A deer tried to eat a hotdog out of your hand?"

01:44:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs at you.

01:45:02 Morris Corlew nods to you.

01:45:05 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

01:45:05 Tobias Hawthorne says, "I just appreciate other birds better. Though Seagull would be a good transport name. If using it for salvaging, anyway."

01:45:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "Gotta keep your eye on those winged deer."

01:45:15 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

01:45:16 Melinda Michaels giggles.

01:45:16 Morris Corlew says, "I just gave it to her. Was a gorgeous doe."

01:45:17 Tobias Hawthorne grins at Nissi Valdaire.

01:45:17 You chuckle at Nissi Valdaire.

01:45:23 "Reindeer?" Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

01:45:26 Nissi Valdaire takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural strawberry juice.

01:45:37 Lily says to Tobias, "Oh thank you I'll name our Transport Seagull when I get one fot eht Org."

01:45:41 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

01:45:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "For the org."

01:45:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:45:46 You grin.

01:46:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I didn't think Hpapy Clam would work."

01:46:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Happy too."

01:46:15 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

01:46:40 Tobias Hawthorne says, "Happy Clam sonuds like a seafood joint."

01:46:41 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

01:46:48 Morris Corlew grins. "It does."

01:46:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

01:46:57 Tobias Hawthorne says, "Or... something else..."

01:47:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squints.

01:47:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:47:07 Morris Corlew glances at Tobias Hawthorne and smirks.

01:47:11 You chuckle.

01:47:36 Lily looks out of the window at at the birds.

01:47:41 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

01:48:00 Tobias Hawthorne navigates his golden brown slider einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:48:21 Morris Corlew finishes off a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural pistachio juice.

01:48:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

01:48:32 Morris Corlew puts a bottle in a shiny chrome trash bin.

01:48:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

01:48:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident finishes off a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

01:49:00 Tobias Hawthorne switches a golden brown slider einrophone off.

01:49:10 Morris Corlew says, "Alright, folks. I'm gonna maybe finish that mine and then get some rest. I been awake way too long."

01:49:17 "Well, I am going to take off. Good luck with things." Melinda Michaels waves.

01:49:18 You wave to Morris Corlew.

01:49:21 Morris Corlew waves.

01:49:24 Morris Corlew mosies out.

01:49:27 You wave to Melinda Michaels.

01:49:35 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the vostok-class capsule "Ain't Lolly Gaggin'" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

01:49:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "11 more ninutes to see if I left the office in a mess before I was booted."

01:49:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:49:41 A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back out.

01:49:44 You chuckle.

01:49:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:50:05 Melinda says to Lily, "You getting your office back?"

01:50:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup."

01:50:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Shule is sDC too!"

01:50:22 Melinda Michaels nods.

01:50:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay, later."

01:50:35 You say, "Now the AEU is in trouble with that Shule guy as SDc,."

01:50:38 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:50:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident giggles.

01:50:51 Melinda Michaels just went into back stairway to the garage.

01:51:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

01:51:05 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the vostok-class capsule "Peregrine Falcon" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

01:51:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

01:51:11 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:51:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:51:17 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Laters Melinda."

01:51:32 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:51:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident finishes off a hot cup of espresso.

01:51:41 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

01:51:43 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Later, enjoy those mines."

01:51:47 Lily looks around for Tegan.

01:51:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

01:51:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a cup in a shiny chrome trash bin.

01:51:59 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

01:52:00 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and Nissi Valdaire are sitting on a slim and fashionable couch. Tobias Hawthorne is standing here.
You can go out.

01:52:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm tryin not to nod off."

01:52:41 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

01:53:02 Tobias rubs his temple.

01:53:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh no, the xeno station is about to fall."

01:53:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow they sure can get loud over there."

01:53:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."

01:53:37 Tobias Hawthorne says, "Time for some rest myself. Later."

01:53:41 You wave to Tobias Hawthorne.

01:53:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Tobias Hawthorne.

01:53:44 Tobias Hawthorne waves.

01:53:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't try and catch it. It's probably perty danged heavy."

01:53:53 Tobias Hawthorne just went into back stairway to the garage.

01:54:09 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the two-person Accord gemini "Hawthorne's Gyrfalcon" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

01:54:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I don't feel like looking for parts. I'll get it later. People will live."

01:54:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

01:54:46 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Holding onto artifacts for a little bit never hurt anyone."

01:55:32 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I will not live. I'm dying right now."

01:55:41 A seagull flaps by the window.

01:55:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Angel."

01:55:59 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Aww."

01:56:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "How's it going, Aldis?"

01:56:35 I don't understand that.

01:56:38 I see no "watch" here.

01:56:54 Nissi Valdaire finishes off a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural strawberry juice.

01:57:03 Nissi Valdaire puts a bottle in a shiny chrome trash bin.

01:57:16 Nissi Valdaire says, "Okay, I'm off for a while."

01:57:18 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Later guys!"

01:57:19 Nissi Valdaire stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

01:57:21 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

01:57:24 Lily says to Nissi, "Thanks for coming by!"

01:57:27 You say to Nissi, "Take care."

01:57:28 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Sure!"

01:57:32 Nissi Valdaire just went into back stairway to the garage.

01:57:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Thankfully no RATS on my third salvaging run, though I know I will have to practice combat soon. I do not want to be caught defenseless like that again."

01:57:40 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

01:57:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin chuckles.

01:58:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Thank you very much for checking in on me, it helps to have advice."

01:58:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "If you do come across some and you don't feel confident, feel free to call."

01:58:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You can reliably handle probes and perhaps miners in that hauler of yours, but fighters, heavy fighters and reapers.. you might want to get out."

01:58:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:58:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well rats are common so just try not to salvage in the main sector. Be sure to keep track of where you are so you can get back to the beaconed sector and you'll be fine."

01:59:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "That will likely happen in the future, I'm sure. Hopefully i'll improve quickly with real life combat experience. And thank you for that advice!"

01:59:40 A pair of pilots stride in haughtily, glimmering with gold and diamonds.

01:59:50 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:59:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-bindin
02:02:59 g resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

Please keep your ships powered down on landing pads and garaged where possible to help prevent bari infestations. If you find your ship is infested, do not land and say something over the alliance channel or tactical channel. Second, please tune your communicators to the alliance tuner or 0 and monitor channel 4. If you do hear of a sector going on alert, please say something over the alliance channel or over tactical. Third, if you would like assistance in learning any aspect of space combat: gunning, flying, or engineering, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me.

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I'm pleased to serve you once again as Ground Squad Leader. Please feel free to contact me for any questions you have.... The Old Frontier Asteroid Mining Processor was cleansed of bari a day ago. There's still one day remaining before it closes for this Conquest to enjoy the best Asteroid Mining around, or if you're not into much work these days, enjoy a drink up in the Star Lounge. The Ship Shop also has some Upgrades. We'll gather another crew soon after the beginning of next Conquest to repeat the process! [00:10 21 August 2317 GST]

The computer reports that the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" has jumped out of the sector.

02:34:54 
AEU gunship "William Dove" departed to EAOS sector Torus Corridor (Alpha-1) less than a minute ago.

02:34:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:35:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:36:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:36:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:36:15 
Registered Merchant 572.................(9, 12, 15)

02:36:25 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Where are you bound?"

02:36:25 Via general sector communication, Registered Merchant 572 transmits a text-based transmission: "Trading run. On my way to Space Station "Foxtrot"."

02:36:27 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 572" has jumped out of the sector.

02:36:34 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:36:34 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:36:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:36:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:36:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:36:55 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:37:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sec, I'm going to go run an errand really quick. I'll be there soon."

02:37:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:37:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No problem!"

02:37:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:37:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:37:35 The ship is already moving.

02:37:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:37:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Telex Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:37:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:37:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:37:38 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 490" has jumped into the sector.

02:37:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:37:42 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 490! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:37:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:37:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:37:45 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:37:45 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

05:15:54 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

05:16:04 You glance at your communicator's screen.

05:16:05 Notice from the Industrial Whip: Greetings, AEU. This is your Whip for this term- I understand that it's currently a trying time and that a good number of our pilots are currently on strike. Of course, I cannot force any of you to work, but those of you who are working are doing a good job currently. In regards to our current conquest, the large majority has been in the form of starship combat, way to go! We are currently 81.8% to our first goal, so lets push and hit it! If anybody has any questions, feel free to send a call to my office, I'll answer them to the best of my ability. [03:15 21 August 2317 GST]

05:17:37 Shule plays with your hair,.

05:18:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Sadly, I have quite some time before I think about doing any asteroid hauling. Best of luck to you, however!"

05:19:47 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

05:19:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

05:20:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As much as I find these new guys entertaining, I have to tune them out for now or I won't sleep."

05:20:24 You nod.

05:20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That's just fine, 'roid haulers are two-person ships and the crew gets equally rewarded for the hauls."

05:20:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:20:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

05:20:57 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:20:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We'd take my hauler out and you'd get to experience what it's like and help set up anchor riggings, earning points and creds for it, of course."

05:21:01 You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Very tempting, but I was planning to retire for the night. I also need to get a proper suit, first."

05:22:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sure enough. I can show you all you need to know tomorrow, if you wish."

05:33:58 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

05:34:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That whip report made me seriously question. I mean, when we're on a strike, we don't want to make our performance goals. In fact, it would serve the purpose of the strike better if we didn't."

05:34:24 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:34:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then there was that whole thing about mining at frontier from the GSL..."

05:34:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I'm sort of expected to push for said goals. But yes, they are pretty damn close to being succeeded in spite of the strike."

05:35:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Means that it's possible someone isn't actually striking."

05:36:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I recently did a lot of beacons, as did constantine and some others. That could have been why combat is the majority."

05:36:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I guess you guys shouldn't wonder about outcord anymore. If you non-strikers even care about all that. Maybe the credits you make will preserve you long enough to see new earth get blown to atoms by a PDB blast."

05:37:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ather, you did say yourself that the strike should have been in full."

05:37:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "People who are doing beacons are helping the conquest a lot."

05:39:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "That may be why I was allowed to get a ship so early, then. I didn't pay the strike too much attention, I must be honest."

05:39:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I became a pilot to be a pilot. I'm a new pilot, and as a new pilot im not going to sit on my ass doing nothing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, yes. I already said I refuse to do absolutely anything except fight hostile enemies invading our space. Decoy beacons make them invade, and it's not even necessarily our space. So I'm not partaking."

05:39:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Indeed, Ather. Shule, Lily and I as well as the Navy responded to a force of pirates in Aenea orbit."

05:39:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I am sure if you were around, you would have as well, since that is the defense of our space and not an invitation to the Outsiders."

05:40:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm trying to tell you guys, maybe if we don't work to help performance goals anymore, it will make the government at least reconsider. Is a few extra credits really worth leaving the accord?"

05:40:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "If I could forgo all of my credits in lieu of exclusively earning points, sure."

05:41:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's true, no one hates Kelsey as much as I do."

05:41:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't want to leave the Accord, but just looking at the conquest data tells me that the strike isn't doing anything because it's not a full strike."

05:43:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can't stop you from working, of course. Just don't stop to wonder later on when the situation only ends up getting worse. I'm still doing my part, and I warned you all already about the consequences of leaving the Accord."

05:43:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I already said it before, but we also need to watch out for Best wanting to privitize our corps."

05:44:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't have to do everything by the letter of the broadcast. Take the initiative like I did. Make yourself partake in a full strike. Try to convince your fellow pilots like I'm trying to do right now to partake in a full strike."

05:46:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Obviously, a partial strike, like you said, did not work. So shut down. Do nothing. Only protect our space, and fulfill the letter of the non-aggression pacts, and help the other alliances if they ask for it. Protect the Accord if it becomes necessary too. Nothing else."

05:48:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd call you to speak of some things, Ather, but I don't have your number. Mine is posted if you care to have a talk."

05:49:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm about to go to bed, and I'd like to give your discussion the full awareness that it probably deserves. So can we do it sometime tomorrow afternoon? I should be around all day."

05:49:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll be around, yeah. We'll talk then."

05:49:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I don't mind talking either."

05:49:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Like I said, we should probably discuss the privatization too."

05:50:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sounds good. In the meantime, I urge all of you to at least consider what I said."

06:05:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "A journey into the dark recesses of space."

06:06:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "With a decided lack of snacks."

06:06:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Where giant, metal-rich rocks come to die."

06:06:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

06:13:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How is it, Okinaj?"

06:13:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "He's getting the treatment you did on your first haul. It took us ages to find one."

06:13:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Well, haven't heard any howling yet.. And we're slowly traversing sectors."

06:13:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "...aaaaand, I didn't fall into a crater. So, overall a positive experience."

06:14:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Was it a good rock?"

06:14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We'll know shortly. Also, I don't know if he did or didn't fall into a crater."

06:14:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The first time you hear those anchors of the ship dig into the asteroid is quite startling, Huh?"

06:14:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "But he's not all.. space dusty, so I think he didn't."

06:15:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Would the dust even stick to the suit in Zero g?"

06:15:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Heh, it was, interesting to say the least. Wasn't quite expecting to be firing a cannon."

06:15:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's the most fun part."

06:15:22 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Stains don't float away just because there's no gravity."

06:15:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin chuckles.

11:13:35 Minor Change:

11:13:36 
The minimum payment for a fine is now one million credits or one fifth of the fine amount, whichever is smaller.

This will have the effect of reducing the financial strain on people with moderate to severe fines, as previously it was simply one fifth of the fine amount, regardless of how large the fine was. In certain instances this means the minimum payment would reach into the tens of millions or higher.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

11:16:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:16:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:16:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:16:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

11:16:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:16:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:16:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:16:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:16:46 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

11:16:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:16:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:16:53 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:16:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

11:17:01 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

11:17:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:17:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:17:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

11:17:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

11:17:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:17:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:17:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:17:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:17:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

You can go east, southeast, and out.

11:18:48 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:18:48 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:18:49 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:18:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

11:18:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:18:59 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 853" has jumped out of the sector.

11:19:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:19:19 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

11:19:20 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

11:19:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:19:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:19:25 a decoy beacon launcher

11:19:25 You see that it is loaded with 1 decoy beacons.
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

11:19:35 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

You can go up.

11:35:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

11:35:21 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

11:35:21 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

11:35:21 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

11:35:23 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

11:35:25 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:35:25 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:35:27 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:35:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

11:35:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:35:39 The starship is already moving.

11:35:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:35:43 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

11:35:43 [Enter `yes' or `no']

11:35:44 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

11:35:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

11:35:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:35:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:35:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:36:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:36:04 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

11:36:32 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

11:47:18 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah ask, "What is that favor?"

11:47:55 You say, "Well, do you have a carrier? I was going to see if you wouldn't mind taking me and my flare across the skims to see if I can't still get some upgrades for it."

11:48:27 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "I do. And I'd be glad to. For sure. But maybe when I wake up? I'll run you over not a problem."

11:48:39 You exclaim, "Ok, cool. Thanks so much!"

11:48:52 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Only if we can do a couple beacons in it sometime though."

11:48:55 Over the line, Evenia Callseah chuckles.

11:49:01 You exclaim, "For sure!"

11:49:16 Over the line, you hear Evenia Callseah say, "Good deal then. I'll help you out when I'm awake."

11:49:33 You say, "See ya."

11:49:36 The connection goes silent with a soft click.

11:49:36 You place a metallic gold touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

11:50:18 The damage control systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

11:50:21 You scramble to your feet.

11:50:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]

11:51:01 This starship has no docking bay. The bay capacity required for this ship is 20 units.

11:56:43 You remove a starship requisition application from a leather briefcase.

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?

11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?

12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?

13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while fighting. What song do you choose?

11:57:53 a starship requisition application

11:57:53 This huge stack of papers appears to be a series of requisition forms for a T6-09 Telex Defense Inc. Pincer-Class Forward Assault Frigate.

11:58:16 I see no "briefcasde" here.

11:58:23 You put a starship requisition application in a leather briefcase.

12:04:42 Automatic daily maintenance is complete.

12:05:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

12:16:01 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent". The organization has earned 2,749,192.15 credits.

12:27:09 You scan the questions written on a starship requisition application and begin filling them out.

12:27:09 (15 seconds roundtime.)

12:27:23 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

12:27:24 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:27:32 You entered: 16:31:52 You entered: I engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships and then destroy any interdictors that are in the sector. I then would try to destroy as many ships as possible before I leave. If left alone, the hostile force could be reinforced and eventually find its way to a civilian location and attack it. My goal would be to try to cripple it as much as possible and still save my ship.

12:27:32 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

12:27:49 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

12:28:01 You entered: I engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships and then destroy any interdictors that are in the sector. I then would try to destroy as many ships as possible before I leave. If left alone, the hostile force could be reinforced and eventually find its way to a civilian location and attack it.

12:28:01 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

12:28:18 2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

12:28:19 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:30:01 You entered: I would report my location, number and class of enemy ships and request reinforcements over tactical. I would also recommend that a crew be placed on stand-by at the civilian location. While reinforcements are on the way, I would engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships as well as destroy any interdictors in the sector. Then I would simply attempt to destroy all of the enemy ships. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human alliance space from all hostile threats.

12:30:01 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

12:30:28 3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

12:30:29 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:32:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hi."

12:32:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yo."

12:32:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

12:32:40 You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily on lasers that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is able to recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is depleted, the ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of being short a gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can move to the empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons room's grid is recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer to apply quick patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not. Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can increase the damage for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for being short a gunner.

12:32:41 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

12:32:49 4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

12:32:50 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:33:50 [General Communication] Erik says in a tone dripping with sarcasm, "I'm loving the headlines. arn't they great?"

12:34:59 You entered: I attempt to destroy any chaining ships, interdicting ships and any interdictors in the sector all the while staying close to the edge in order to make a quick get away. Having taken note of the number of ships remaining in the sector, I leave, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine the number of the reinforcing ships. I report all of this over tactical and ask for reinforcements.

12:34:59 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

12:35:07 5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

12:35:07 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:36:42 You entered: We destroy the escorting ships and leave since this kind of ship cannot be destroyed by conventional weapons. The last magistrate-class mothership had to be captured with the use of battle suits. We contact the Accord and don't come back without cruisers that have been adapted with special shielding that can repel a PDB and battle suits.

12:36:42 Is this okay? Please make sure that your answer is a complete sentence, if appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']

12:36:52 6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

12:36:53 
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:37:01 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent". The organization has earned 1,633,423.61 credits.

12:38:03 You entered: My priority would be the capitol planets as they are the most inhabited and also the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and one must fly through those sectors to get to capitol sectors. If, for example, providence Gate were to be interdicted, other ships would not be able to get to New Earth until such time that Providence Gate was no longer interdicted.

12:58:51 You sign several notices and affirmations on a starship requisition application.

12:58:51 (60 seconds roundtime.)

12:59:36 You must be in a ship store to submit a starship requisition application

12:59:45 Wait 7 seconds.

12:59:48 Wait 4 seconds.

12:59:49 Wait 2 seconds.

12:59:50 Wait 2 seconds.

12:59:51 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

You entered: I engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships and then destroy any interdictors that are in the sector. I then would try to destroy as many ships as possible before I leave. If left alone, the hostile force could be reinforced and eventually find its way to a civilian location and attack it. My goal would be to try to cripple it as much as possible and still save my ship.

2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

You entered: I would report my location, number and class of enemy ships and request reinforcements over tactical. I would also recommend that a crew be placed on stand-by at the civilian location. While reinforcements are on the way, I would engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships as well as destroy any interdictors in the sector. Then I would simply attempt to destroy all of the enemy ships. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human alliance space from all hostile threats.

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily on lasers that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is able to recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is depleted, the ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of being short a gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can move to the empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons room's grid is recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer to apply quick patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not. Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can increase the damage for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for being short a gunner.

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

You entered: I attempt to destroy any chaining ships, interdicting ships and any interdictors in the sector all the while staying close to the edge in order to make a quick get away. Having taken note of the number of ships remaining in the sector, I leave, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine the number of the reinforcing ships. I report all of this over tactical and ask for reinforcements.

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

You entered: We destroy the escorting ships and leave since this kind of ship cannot be destroyed by conventional weapons. The last magistrate-class mothership had to be captured with the use of battle suits. We contact the Accord and don't come back without cruisers that have been adapted with special shielding that can repel a PDB and battle suits.

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

You entered: My priority would be the capitol planets as they are the most inhabited and also the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and one must fly through those sectors to get to capitol sectors. If, for example, providence Gate were to be interdicted, other ships would not be able to get to New Earth until such time that Providence Gate was no longer interdicted. 

7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

You entered: I would simply obey the naval wing commander within reason. I would first ensure that I understood everything he or she asked of me and my crew.

8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issues missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?

You entered: I have fought against Lambda Pirate Cartel, Omega Pirate Cartel, allied pirate / merry band and unreg ships during salvage ops and minor skirmishes.

13:03:37 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:03:38 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

13:04:50 You can go up.

13:04:54 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

13:04:54 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

13:04:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:04:56 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

13:04:57 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

13:04:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:04:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:04:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:05:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

13:05:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:05:14 The ship is already moving.

13:05:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:05:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Telex Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:05:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:05:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

13:05:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:05:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:05:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:05:23 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Telex in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

13:05:26 Via general sector communication, Telex transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

13:05:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:05:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:05:49 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:05:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:05:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:06:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:06:05 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:06:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:15:46 You entered: 16:58:33 You entered: My priority would be the capitol planets as they are the most inhabited and also the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and one must fly through those sectors to get to capitol sectors.

13:23:51 You sign several notices and affirmations on a starship requisition application.

13:23:52 (60 seconds roundtime.)

13:24:32 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 404,831.23 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

13:24:36 You must be in a ship store to submit a starship requisition application

13:24:43 Wait 9 seconds.

13:24:47 Wait 4 seconds.

13:24:48 Wait 3 seconds.

13:24:49 Wait 2 seconds.

13:24:50 Wait 1 seconds.

13:24:52 1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own. What do you do and why?

You entered: I engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships and then destroy any interdictors that are in the sector. I then would try to destroy as many ships as possible before I leave. If left alone, the hostile force could be reinforced and eventually find its way to a civilian location and attack it. My goal would be to try to cripple it as much as possible and still save my ship.

2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?

You entered: I would report my location, number and class of enemy ships and request reinforcements over tactical. I would also recommend that a crew be placed on stand-by at the civilian location. While reinforcements are on the way, I would engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships as well as destroy any interdictors in the sector. Then I would simply attempt to destroy all of the enemy ships. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human alliance space from all hostile threats.

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?

You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily on lasers that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is able to recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is depleted, the ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of being short a gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can move to the empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons room's grid is recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer to apply quick patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not. Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can increase the damage for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for being short a gunner.

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving soon. What actions do you take?

You entered: I attempt to destroy any chaining ships, interdicting ships and any interdictors in the sector all the while staying close to the edge in order to make a quick get away. Having taken note of the number of ships remaining in the sector, I leave, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine the number of the reinforcing ships. I report all of this over tactical and ask for reinforcements.

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?

You entered: We destroy the escorting ships and leave since this kind of ship cannot be destroyed by conventional weapons. The last magistrate-class mothership had to be captured with the use of battle suits. We contact the Accord and don't come back without cruisers that have been adapted with special shielding that can repel a PDB and battle suits.

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what would be your priority and why?

You entered: 16:58:33 You entered: My priority would be the capitol planets as they are the most inhabited and also the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and one must fly through those sectors to get to capitol sectors.

9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

You entered: When I am solo, I often do not begin repairs as soon as I should.

10. How long do you expect thi
13:24:52 s ship to remain undamaged?

You entered: Well, since I tend to get hit at least once during a beacon or  combat situation, not long. I plan to conduct a beacon drop as soon as I can after purchasing and upgrading it.

11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?

You entered: Perhaps during an invasion or if I attempt a very high decoy beacon drop in it, but hopefully, it will never be destroyed.

8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issues missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?

You entered: I have fought against Lambda Pirate Cartel, Omega Pirate Cartel, allied pirate / merry band and unreg  ships during salvage ops and minor skirmishes.

9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?

You entered: When I am solo, I tend not to begin repairs as soon as I should.

10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?
14:03:32 

You entered: Well, since I tend to get hit at least once during a beacon or  combat situation, not long. I plan to conduct a beacon drop as soon as I can after purchasing and upgrading it.

11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?

You entered: Perhaps during an invasion or if I attempt a very high decoy beacon drop in it, but hopefully, it will never be destroyed.

12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?

You entered: Lethal Strike

13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while fighting. What song do you choose?

You entered: Thunderstruck by ACDC

14. What is your favorite color?

You entered: Red


14:06:48 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

14:06:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Telex-Providence Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

14:06:49 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

14:06:50 You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:06:51 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

14:06:51 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

14:06:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:06:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:06:54 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:06:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:06:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:07:08 The ship is already moving.

14:07:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:07:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:07:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:07:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

14:07:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:07:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:07:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:07:18 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:07:21 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

14:07:24 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

14:07:25 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

14:07:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:07:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:07:53 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:07:57 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

14:07:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:07:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:08:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:08:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:08:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:08:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

14:08:10 You can go out and enter into the ship.

You'll hear back in the mail on their decision."

Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

15:31:15 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:31:15 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:16:46 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Mhm, 'milage' alone lets you know how many sectors you've traveled. Resetting it helps keep an accurate check of that."

20:16:49 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Deadly Strike. Welcome to Accord space."

20:16:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Mileage, even."

20:17:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:17:24 The ship is already moving.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

21:10:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:10:10 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:27:04 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which was destroyed when the ICC bombed his shuttle."

22:27:05 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits an irritating burst of static.

22:27:19 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Poor Joss."

22:27:42 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I was so relieved that he survived through all that shit. It was crazy."

22:28:01 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Isn't that why he ended up saying 'fuck it I'm out?'"

22:28:39 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, the bombing was after he retired. I forget where he was traveling."

22:28:45 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Ahh."

22:29:06 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "He gave me his super ice cream synthesis unit and the mighty fork."

22:29:15 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And a bunch of his old photos."

22:29:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That ice cream thing is epic."

22:29:53 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "The mightiest fork."

22:30:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The grandest fork."

22:30:15 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "So innocent and fork-looking, but capable of ever so much."

22:30:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Wait...fork?"

22:30:30 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."

22:30:31 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "The fork."

22:30:37 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The fork!"

22:30:39 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Do I wanna know?"

22:30:47 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "About forks? I should hope so."

22:30:58 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I'd bet about half the people around know what we're talking about, and the rest have no idea."

22:31:00 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.

22:31:08 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't even know if half do."

22:31:10 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs. "I mean about this particular fork."

22:31:27 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "It is a mighty fork."

22:31:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The mightiest?"

22:31:56 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The mightiest."

22:32:27 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm. Keegan, maybe you, me, Nissi, possibly Eli and Johann know about the true power of the fork. Melinda might've as well. She might've seen it in action."

22:32:39 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Possibly Morris? Who can know!"

22:32:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No clue what y'all're even talkin bout."

22:32:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're talking about your dinner forks, right?"

22:32:55 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alas."

22:33:03 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure?"

22:33:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd love to hear the story though."

22:33:22 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The mystical powers of the fork are better demonstrated."

22:33:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or are you talking about that wicked looking fork of doom."

22:33:34 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Sadly I think I missed the fork."

22:33:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That ain't xactly possible at the moment Ather."

22:33:55 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow, that's disappointing! You were totally around when Joss was, Johann!"

22:33:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm riftin south of Campeche bout 2 light-years out."

22:33:59 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I remember the fork."

22:34:01 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You and Brynn."

22:34:01 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I was."

22:34:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wasn't round when this Joss person was."

22:34:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I only been here 15 months."

22:34:28 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would've been utterly shocked speechless if you didn't remember the fork, Nissi."

22:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Seems like more and more pilots are being riled about the situation with the government. Just saw to pilots going at it in the lounge."

22:34:54 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The fork has been used in recent times, Morris. I just thought you might've seen it used is all. Not Joss using it."

22:35:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah."

22:35:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Two pilots, even."

22:35:20 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am now intrigued about the fork."

22:35:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 404,850.03 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

22:35:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Progress. Honestly, I'd rather see devisiveness over doing nothing at all and letting outcord actually happen."

22:35:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We all are."

22:35:40 [General Communication] Prichard Grant transmits, "Is it more like a pitchfork or trident? A weapon of sorts?"

22:35:47 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is a fork!"

22:35:54 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not a pitchfork."

22:35:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe it's like a fork in the road."

22:36:07 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What."

22:36:15 [General Communication] "I dunno!" Morris Corlew laughs.

22:37:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Idealy, I'd like to see more and more pilots join in a full strike."

22:38:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Honestly, one big reason why I didn't strike is because I already put a lot into this conquest and I prefer to finish what I start."

22:38:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The whole point of a strike like this is to ensure purposely, yes, purposely that the alliance does not meet its goals."

22:39:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, you won't see me contribute for the next conquest, at least."

22:39:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "We're supposed to be doing our best to disrupt the flow of resources and credits into the alliance so that they will reconsider outcord. Once that's done, we can get back to working in full capacity again."

22:40:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Dakhal Does sort of have a point on one thing though, we're not the biggest part of the infrastructure."

22:40:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Remember, don't even volunteer for beacon drops, any ground activities, or...well, do just about anything else short of fighting in an invasion!"

22:41:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But we contribute sizeable amounts to it. One thing we all should be doing more, and I totally would if I had the time, is float over new earth, and encourage merchants to deliver their trade cargo elsewhere, and to not buy any exports from New earth."

22:42:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do that, continue with the strike, and you'll definitely put a nice dent in the infrastructure."

22:43:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes, it's true that merchants travel to more than just New Earth in the Union, but you need to consider that New Earth is the capital. Encourage merchants to turn away from the capital and you might actually encourage them to turn away from the entire union until the government stops outcord negotiations."

22:43:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I will begin to do this myself in just a couple of hours. I hope everyone who wants to will join me."

22:44:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its true. Trade is the life blood of any economy."

22:44:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You all also need to consider something else, too. If in the end we are such a small part of the infrastructure, why are we banned from visiting a majority of AEU holdings? We have a bigger impact on the alliance's infrastructure than President Best is willing to admit to."

22:46:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Stand firm when you're doing this. Even if he sends the navy after you, don't back down. Don't fire first, heck, don't fire at all. I repeat, do not fire any shot at our loyal naval crews. This is not their fault, or their fight. If they end up destroying your ships, it will look worst for the President. They're just following orders, though."

22:46:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "A fair point, I mean, we're banned from a lot of places becuase a presence of how much wealth we can earn."

22:46:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Precisely."

22:47:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't let the propeganda machine make you believe that you have a smaller impact than you really do."

22:47:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Stand firm, stand strong and most importantly of all, stand united. The more people we have united in this strike the better."

22:51:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ather, I know your focused on the strike but we need to d o some looking into the privitization of our corps. Like I said. It could mean Best himself might have tighter control over who can and cant be a pilot amoungst us."

22:52:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One thing at a time, Tara. I agree about privatization. I fucking hate the possibility that it could happen to us. However, right now, we need to keep laser focus on the outcord situation. If that fails, then pretty much nothing Best does will matter anymore, including privatizing the corps."

22:52:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The privatisastion issue was only recently announced, we have time for that. But we're creeping up on the end of the Outccord negotiations right now."

22:53:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "He suggested that as a distraction to shift our focus. We need to not let it make us lose our focus though. We have to concentrate all of our efforts on doing what we can to ensure that the Union stays in the Accord."

22:55:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Agreed, I think the strike shoudl continue until the negotiations are stopped and the government agrees wot work with the opposition to come up with a different solution than leaveing the Accord."

22:56:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're trying to shut out any disagreement at all, they will do the same with privatisation. That's the wall we need to break through."

22:57:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, I must dash! If you guys really are going to do the merchant thing, I wish you the best of luck! I hope to help with that hopefully in the coming week."

22:57:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We have to show them that shutting us all out isn't so easy."

22:58:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I will be later Ather, even if it just ends up being me."

23:22:05 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"
