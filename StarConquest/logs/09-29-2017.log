00:02:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd love to tell him hey dude you don't make any sense at all. If I'd have not said anything concerning hard feelings, then I know what I said would be rather shallow so you can't have it both ways."

00:03:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm convince he isn't the brightest star out there."

Ather,
As you know, I sent a letter to Nissi regarding the incident in which my clipper, "Firestorm" was fired upon by a League cruiser. Now, I am well aware that accidental friendly fire happens. I myself have been guilty of inflicting fire on friendly ships due to circumstances not always within my control. Nissi's response to me was essentially that it was accidental fire resulting from me moving into coordinates at which the League cruiser had already begun firing. However, this was not the case.
I distinctly remember the tracking information for the enemy updating twice very quickly indicating first, that the enemy had moved and then that my ship had moved to new coordinates. Immediately after my tracking information had updated, the League cruiser locked on my clipper. Then, upon hearing my engine sounds die out as a result of the ship completing its maneuver, I heard the distinctive rattle of chain gun rounds striking the hull along with the computer announcement that we had been hit by the cruiser. Clearly, this indicates that I had not just moved into range after they had begun firing, they clearly locked on me and fired.
Now, I admit that my statements at the end of my letter to Nissi were probably an over reaction, but my point had been simply that accidental fire was one thing. The fact that the league cruiser locked on my ship, fired and then Morris making his comment over tactical, lead me to believe that pe
00:27:29 rhaps it had not been accidental. I only wish to inform Nissi of the situation and express my concern for my ship and my crew if the fire had really not been accidental. Nissi and Melinda want a full apology for my threat at the end of my letter and for insinuating that the league cruiser fired on my clipper on purpose. I am generally not a violent person and would not just open hostilities without first receiving instructions to do so from the government. As the only active Ace pilot of the AEU and soon to be Voice of the Corps, I'd like to ask for your advice as how to proceed from here. I do not wish to make this an inter alliance issue, but I strongly feel I was not at fault here. Thank you for your consideration.

Group Battlesuit Status

Lily Kaise: League Paladin (Tier 5)

00:47:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

00:47:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:47:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:47:48 You say, "I need to switch battlesuits."

00:47:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Daisy May, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:47:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure."

00:47:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Let me see what I can do."

00:47:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:48:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That's why I wanted to go over earlier."

00:48:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:48:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:48:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:48:08 You nod and grin.

00:48:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:48:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:48:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:48:14 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

00:48:14 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:48:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:48:16 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

00:48:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:48:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:48:18 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:48:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:48:21 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

00:48:22 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"

00:48:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:48:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:48:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

00:48:38 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

00:48:42 An average-sized red felo rubs up against an obese octarine soldier felo, and both animals purr softly.

00:48:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

00:48:44 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

00:48:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:48:54 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:48:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Daisy May. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:48:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:49:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:49:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

00:49:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

She has rounded shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is round, lightly-freckled, and plain, with an arched nose and round chin. Her lips are plump and reddish pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are grey and round. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is light honey brown and hanging in a thick, fluffy mass over her shoulders. She has long clear fingernails. She has a flashy pale pink crystal snowflake hairpin in her hair. She has a small mole on her neck.
 She is wearing a pale pink satin v-neck tee, a platinum watch with a round face, a pair of faded blue jeans, and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a red metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack, a flight control scanner, an alliance information assistant, and a standard starship flightbag. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:56:51 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

00:56:51 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Rahab Cassidy is lounging on a couch. Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.

01:20:12 Rahab Cassidy speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:

01:20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "Thank you."

01:20:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No problem!"

01:20:47 Johnathon Triggs says, OOCly, "How do you call up the list of what suits are here? I can't remember..."

01:21:01 You say, OOCly, "Go northwest from here and type list."

01:21:08 Johnathon Triggs walks northwest.

01:21:09 An EAOS Elementalist suddenly splits down the front and deposits Eli Grey.

01:21:19 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the northwest.

01:21:31 Johnathon Triggs says, OOCly, "Ah, right. That's where it is."

01:21:35 Johnathon Triggs presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour from storage and sets it in front of him.

01:21:35 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:21:37 Johnathon Triggs presses a button on an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:21:38 Rahab Cassidy asks, OOCly, "Do I need to do anything to pick up the suit or can I spare a moment or two to get the pooch taken out?"

01:21:50 You say, OOCly, "You'll need to leave an reboard the ship."

01:21:58 Rahab Cassidy says, OOCly, "Oh okay."

01:22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok are they all there now?"

01:22:10 Rahab Cassidy mosies northwest.

01:24:12 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the northwest.

01:24:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Now we're ready to party."

01:24:23 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Conjurer from storage and sets it in front of you.

01:24:23 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:24:25 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

01:24:34 Johnathon Triggs presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour from storage and sets it in front of him.

01:24:34 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:24:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "For sure!"

01:25:07 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Need to hit the potty real quick."

01:25:12 Eli Grey presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an EAOS Elementalist from storage and sets it in front of him.

01:25:12 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:25:13 Eli Grey presses a button on an EAOS Elementalist, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:25:14 You say, OOCly, "Go for it."

01:25:29 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."

01:25:34 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

01:25:37 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

01:25:37 [Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Deployment]
You see an EAOS Conjurer, Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour), Rahab Cassidy (AEU Light Combatant), and Eli Grey (EAOS Elementalist) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

01:25:42 You speak into the microphone.

01:25:50 You press a button on an EAOS Conjurer, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

01:25:54 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

01:26:14 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

01:26:19 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

01:26:20 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

01:26:22 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

01:26:25 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

01:26:27 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

01:26:27 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:26:47 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

01:26:47 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:27:07 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

01:27:07 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You can go south.

01:27:13 You peer south...

01:27:14 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go north and east.

01:27:30 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Rahab Cassidy (AEU Light Combatant).

01:27:36 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Johnathon Triggs (AISSF Rental Basic Combat Armour).

01:27:44 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (League Paladin).

01:27:55 You exclaim, "Howdy everyone!"

01:27:59 Rahab Cassidy exclaims, "Hi!"

01:28:01 Johnathon Triggs says, "Wow..."

01:28:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok a couple of things."

01:28:04 Rahab Cassidy asks, "Anything I should know before we begin this?"

01:28:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes."

01:28:09 Rahab Cassidy says, "Oh yes."

01:28:22 Johnathon Triggs says, "Follow Lily, first of all."

01:28:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Please don't repair me unless I am at least 30 percent damaged."

01:28:30 Johnathon Triggs nods.

01:28:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to Johnathon Triggs, "Do you have repair?"

01:28:44 Johnathon Triggs says, "I do."

01:28:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Ok perfect!"

01:28:57 Eli Grey (EAOS Elementalist)

01:28:58 This is a slim, almost delicate-looking battlesuit, painted dark silver all over. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A laser attachment is mounted to the right wrist. A large plasma cannon is mounted to the left forearm, a neutronium-laced metal tube leading to a large tank on the back of the suit. A secondary attachment with a small plasma duct, several defensive lasers, and an EMM is mounted to the left shoulder. A large subsonic projector is mounted to the left shoulder.
It appears to be 0% damaged.

01:29:02 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Eli Grey (EAOS Elementalist).

01:29:05 Johnathon Triggs says, "I also have mini chainguns and Chainguns."

01:29:10 Eli Grey asks, "So just envelop reverb, hammer and spike?"

01:29:21 Johnathon Triggs says, "About... 1700 rounds of ammo."

01:29:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So Johnathon and Rahab please only repair and would appreciate it if you would not shoot very often so you don't become targets."

01:29:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

01:29:36 Rahab Cassidy nods.

01:29:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know you want to so I won't tell you not to shoot."

01:29:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:29:45 Eli Grey salutes Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Ready to rock Ground Squad Leader ma'am."

01:29:46 Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:29:47 You grin.

01:29:51 Rahab Cassidy laughs.

01:29:57 Rahab Cassidy says, "I can handle just repairing. I'm sure."

01:30:03 Johnathon Triggs salutes sharply.

01:30:10 Eli Grey says, "And do'nt pick up any of the condoms."

01:30:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok moving south."

01:30:17 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

01:30:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident moves south.

01:30:20 Eli Grey moves south.

01:30:21 Rahab Cassidy laughs.

01:30:21 You move south.

01:30:24 
[Ventilation Tunnels; T-Junction] (inside a battlesuit)
Here, a straight tunnel branches into two alternatives. One can go that way, or one can go that other way. The possibilities are endless!
You see Bari Vine Cluster Alpha here.
You can go north, south, and west.

01:30:28 Eli Grey wrinkles his nose.

01:30:33 You say, "Vine."

01:30:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh boy a real meanie."

01:30:44 You say, "Heard it through the bari vine."

01:30:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So."

01:30:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:30:51 Eli Grey says, "Hopefully I remember how to plasma things."

01:30:55 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

01:31:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So i'll put up squad it's not very strong but it will work."

01:31:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (League Paladin) prepares to use Squad Restoration!

And the bugs. Always the bugs.

02:48:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok launch."

02:48:07 I don't see "cocoon" here.

02:48:08 You light your battlesuit's ascent rockets and begin speeding toward the waiting aerial fortress.

02:48:09 (20 seconds roundtime.)

02:48:29 [Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

02:48:29 The aerial fortress appears to be at Old Frontier Processor.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
You rocket through the fortress's entrance hatch and stumble to a stop on the deck.

02:48:29 Illuminate wears off.

02:48:29 Bari Spew wears off.

02:48:31 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

02:48:31 [Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Deployment]
You see an EAOS Conjurer here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
Rahab Cassidy abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

02:48:37 An AEU Light Combatant suddenly splits down the front and deposits Rahab Cassidy.

02:48:39 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

02:48:39 Johnathon Triggs abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

02:48:40 A crane descends from the ceiling and efficiently returns all battlesuits in the area to storage.

02:48:41 A quiet beep serves to notify you that the aerial fortress has completed repairs of all stored equipment.

02:48:42 Rahab Cassidy stretches.

02:48:42 Consider it done! (Since there are no battlesuits here anyway.)

02:48:44 [Aerial Fortress "Petunia"; Battlesuit Storage]

02:49:48 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident and Rahab Cassidy are standing here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

02:50:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Glad you all could come it took awhile."

02:50:24 The aerial fortress suddenly fires its ascent thrusters, rocketing toward open space.

02:50:26 Rahab Cassidy says into the PA microphone, "Good practice for me though."

02:50:27 You speak into the microphone.

02:50:29 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says into the PA microphone, "Yeah, glad I could help."

02:50:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure glad you could too!"

02:50:44 You give Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident a thumbs up!

02:50:44 The vibrations of ascent start to ease off slightly as the aerial fortress moves into open space.

02:50:45 Johnathon Triggs's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks for the invite. It was a 'blast."

02:51:04 At the top of its ascent, the aerial fortress gently comes into contact with "Daisy May" and the docking clamps snap into place.

02:51:06 Rahab Cassidy moves up through the starship access tunnel.

02:51:07 [Starship "Daisy May"; Docking Bay]

02:51:07 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, an octarine feathered felo, a normal white soldier felo, and the aerial fortress and deployment station "Petunia" here.
Rahab Cassidy is standing here.
You can go up.
Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident exits from the aerial fortress and deployment station "Petunia".

02:51:09 [Starship "Daisy May"; Main Deck]

02:51:10 You see a small purple ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, an average-sized red felo, a normal octarine soldier felo, a sleeping white soldier felo, an obese octarine soldier felo, an octarine felo, and a medium-sized red soldier felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

02:51:10 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]

You can go south and out.

02:51:11 There are no other ships in the sector.

02:51:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:51:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:51:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:51:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:51:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

02:51:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:51:21 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident shuffles in from the south.

02:51:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:51:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:51:23 The computer reports that the two-person heavy launch vessel "Registered Merchant 048" has jumped into the sector.

02:51:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:51:24 Rahab Cassidy mosies in from the south.

02:51:25 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

02:51:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:51:26 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

02:51:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:51:27 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:51:29 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

02:51:30 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"
Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident strokes a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl lovingly.

02:51:34 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident strokes the soft fur of an average-sized octarine soldier felo.

02:51:34 An average-sized octarine soldier felo purrs softly.

02:51:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:51:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:51:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:51:42 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident bounces a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads toward an average-sized octarine soldier felo.

02:51:43 An average-sized octarine soldier felo leaps after the ball.

02:51:50 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the south.

02:51:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:51:56 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:51:57 Rahab Cassidy exclaims, "They're so cute!"

02:52:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Daisy May. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:52:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:52:01 Rahab Cassidy says, "Even the soldier ones."

02:52:04 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident bounces a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads toward an average-sized octarine soldier felo.

02:52:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yepthey're fun!"

02:52:07 An average-sized octarine soldier felo bats wildly at the ball.

02:52:07 You grin.

02:52:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:52:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thanks so much everyone."

02:52:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

02:52:17 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:52:17 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:52:18 You say, "Thanks all."

02:52:18 Rahab Cassidy says, "Thank you as well."

02:52:19 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident waves.

02:52:20 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident shuffles out.

02:52:23 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:52:23 You wave.
Rahab Cassidy mosies out.

02:52:24 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:52:28 [Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]

02:52:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, Emmylou the humanoid service robot, and an average-sized octarine soldier felo here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and Johnathon Triggs are standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:52:43 An average-sized octarine soldier felo marches south.

02:52:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

02:52:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:53:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident holds your hand, taking you into her group.

02:53:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident holds Johnathon Triggs's hand, taking him into her group.

02:53:07 You follow Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident out.

You can go north, south, west, and down.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

02:53:14 The four-person mule "Daisy May" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

02:53:18 You wave to Evangeline Adaire.

02:53:19 You follow Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident into a transparisteel doorway into the pilot lounge.

02:53:20 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go out.

02:53:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident disbands her group.

02:53:29 Johnathon Triggs salutes Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:53:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:53:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thanks."

02:53:36 You grin.

02:53:43 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

02:53:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok well I 'be right back."

02:53:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

02:54:20 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:54:41 Johnathon Triggs waves.

02:54:42 Johnathon Triggs walks out.

02:55:12 There appear to be 22 pilots recently active.

03:37:58 I don't understand that.

03:38:01 Recent Major Changes:

-----
Asteroid Mining Expansion

Miners with bronze, silver, or gold mining licenses now have a random chance of being offered a special type of asteroid to process. You can decline this offer and work a normal site instead if you prefer.

* Metal-rich: These asteroids simply have more ore to process, and are a much bigger target for poachers.

* Comet: On comets, you may extract water ice for a boost to your payout. Ice is extracted using separate ice mining buildings, but the ice does not require processing.

* Radioactive: The third tier processors and higher will be able to extract radioactives as well as metal from your ore, boosting your payout. To support the power requirements of these advanced processors, radioisotope thermoelectric generators will be available.

The asteroids you're used to are now known as rocky asteroids.

Special asteroid types should provide approximately a 10-20% boost to payout at the cost of the special considerations outlined above. As always, please report any outsized rewards or other issues with the new asteroids.

It's got te longest range, and the extra damage the lookout drone gives it well, it's just sick. Defense is my favorite part of mining, to be honest."

03:56:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Fomorian Eli Grey transmits, "I used to put plasma turrets all over the place, even I can see that it's a bit of an overkill."

04:08:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Fomorian Eli Grey transmits, "Years ago when I was Voice,  I had them send out the survey team to do just that, we collected a lot on tha tdonation machine in the conference room. But when they went out it was apparently too close to Fringe space and there was a dispute. But I bet if we went out far enough and found a different cluster to send the survey team to, we could do it."

04:45:37 You follow Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident into the ship.

04:45:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair with Prissy the sleeping big violet long-haired felo on it, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:45:39 You say, "That's what I thought you meant."

04:45:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:45:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:45:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:45:47 You laugh.

04:45:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:45:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:46:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:46:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:46:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:46:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:46:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:46:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:46:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:46:16 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:46:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:46:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:46:18 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

04:46:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:46:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:46:21 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:46:23 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

04:46:24 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

04:46:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:46:28 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:46:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:46:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:46:36 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:46:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:46:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:46:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:46:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

04:46:53 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:46:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident disbands her group.

04:46:56 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:46:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

04:47:00 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:47:12 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair with Prissy the sleeping big violet long-haired felo on it, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" and the one-person cargo hauler "This Isn't The Hauler You're Looking For" are landed here.

14:28:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:28:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:28:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:28:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:29:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:29:22 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

14:29:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

14:29:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

14:29:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:25:25 [MTTS] aaronjw89: I have a question for staff around if anyone is available.

21:25:34 [MTTS] aaronjw89: It's just a random bit.

21:27:47 [MTTS] aaronjw89: Are there are a way to keep character notes of logs of goals, thoughts, actions taken, things of that for the staff to look over to get a look of character rp to achieve goals, or perhaps let staff in on things a character does or no? I have played a few games that have this, and was wondering. I wanted to start trying to keep track of things and maybe flush out my character and try and help staff keep track of that, but don't necessarily want to be irritating with support tickets and the like. I'm not sure if that's even necessary, but just a random thought.

21:28:18 [MTTS] alc_71: The goals command?

21:28:22 [MTTS] Ulias: There's a goals command.

21:28:24 [MTTS] something: I'm obviously not a member of staff, but there's the goals command.

21:28:31 [MTTS] aaronjw89: There is a goal command? Oh my.

21:29:02 [MTTS] aaronjw89: Well, thank you.

21:29:15 [MTTS] Ulias: Also, I've learned the hard way recently to not worry about doing too many support tickets, if you are somehow doing too many they'll let you know.

21:29:55 [MTTS] davetaylor: That's in those annoying newbie tips, which are really useful when you start out, but annoying when you'v been hear years, but this made me think, is there a way to see all those newbie tips, so that people who want a remind, or are new, can see them all?

21:30:43 [MTTS] something: Some of that stuff is really useful to newbies, but I'm pretty sure a bunch of them just ignore them by day two.

21:30:56 [MTTS] something: So yeah, I think it'd be really cool if they could all be put somewhere.

21:31:02 [MTTS] davetaylor: They are useful when you actually need them, hence my question.

21:31:10 [MTTS] aaronjw89: I've actually not paid much attention to them but I probably should've really. I've just kinda done my thing and hoped something came of it. Not that I want to push for things to happen outside of staff plans, but I am wanting to be used!

21:32:26 [MTTS] Ulias: From the way I understand it, they actually encourage you to take character actions through the support tickets.

21:32:59 [MTTS] Ulias: Your character get super invovled in that way.

21:33:11 [MTTS] something: If the paragraph from the goals command was TLDR, it basicly says that it's not meant as a way to talk to staff, just as a way for you to keep your own notes that they can look through if ever.

21:33:39 [Tactical Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "A-59 is clear."

21:33:58 [MTTS] alc_71: I think you can request they look at them from time to time. If there is something in there that they could help with.

21:34:13 [MTTS] Ulias: Also, type policy 14 if you haven't already.

22:48:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:48:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:48:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:48:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:48:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:48:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:48:31 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:15:36 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:15:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.
