02:52 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]

02:52 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

Constantine had a good theory that it might have been the name of a place, we don't really have translations for a lot of their locations."

03:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "As in "welcoem to Uberdiosk" We don't know for sure though, perhaps someone at the EAOS will be able to tell us somethign from the log you sent."

03:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No."

03:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "He seemed interested that uberdiosk didn't translate to anything, that's about it."

03:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well at least erto is a greeting but will be interesting if there's something about the other word."

03:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "How sure are you that you didn't miswrite it?"

03:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm curious if it's a place."

03:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Positively certain. If I did mishear it.. and spelled it wrong. Is there words related to it? That may sound similar?"

03:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Perhaps it is the name of a place."

03:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's what constantine said earlier, I think that's probably a good guess Lily."

03:46 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's the thing with the translator. Even one letter off will kistranslate."

03:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Although would seem odd that they would just say welcom and the name of a particular place but I don't know much about how Jinu or anything about how Jinu would construct a sentence or phrase."

03:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Either that, or it's the ultimate version of a diosk."

03:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, I am pretty certain that I didn't mispell it."

03:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey snickers.

03:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

03:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nah... I don't think it was the name of a place. The grammer is off."

03:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "You don't say, "Welcome, to new earth." do you? You'd say, "Welcome to new earth.""

03:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right,  but it's an alien language."

03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The Children of the Sun, for example, communicate in images. It's truly alien."

03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Though.. that said. Saying "welcome, to new earth." Would mean, "I welcome you, to new earth..""

03:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I was about to say that so alien language could be in imagry or very simplistic language ot anything."

03:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or that is."

03:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. I suppose I am just thinking that it may mean more than our simple human terms."

03:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't know much about the COTS languages. I am sure it would be interesting to learn about."

03:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

03:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ather? What's the words for Human in Jinu?"

We are running low on station parts from your org. Please toss a couple cores, several basic control centers and a couple toll trackers in either your warehouse or Cats warehouse so that we may be able to access them quickly. If anybody reads this, please tell whomever you notice on comm's that is a member of RUNE we need the parts.

Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

11:58 You are carrying nothing.

11:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

11:59 a letter

11:59 This is a letter. It is addressed to Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident, and was sent by Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

11:59 --
Melinda, We'd appreciate some clarifications on where SEAS will be included on Temporary Space Stations. It's evident that Morris isn't including us on the Asteroid processor in 285. You may recall during the meeting that we indicated that we would include Morris's organization on anything which we build going forward whenever we are responsible for any given station. When you phoned me, you only indicated that we weren't included in 287, 288 and GMG. If Morris isn't going to cooperate, we would appreciate the opportunity to resume building the Asteroid processor in 285 or at least be provided a time frame as to when we will be included on future stations in 285. We weren't included on the Xenology station in Belt of Orion. Constantine needs to research a lot of artifacts and he only wants to research those on a Xenology station where SEAS is included. He has quite a bit to pay back for his fine. I'd rather not put up our own although we can obtain a Xenology Scanner. Therefore, please provide a time frame as to when SEAS will be included again on the Xenology station in Belt of Orion. If we're not going to be included, then we will begin building our own going forward. Last, regarding the BAS West of New Earth. The BAS West of the Torus was down the other day and Shule and I had some time to run beacons in his Flare. Since we didn't know when we would be included on the next BAS, we built the one West of New Earth. We ran 4
11:59  beacons. However, we have run all subsequent beacons via the BAS West of the Torus and I specifically informed SEAS members not to use the BAS West of New Earth that it was only put up to fill the gap between the BAS West of the Torus being unavailable and it's subsequent deployment. Provided we are included on future BAS stations in the future, we have no plans to redeploy nor have we encouraged anyone to utilize SEAS. Thank you. - Lily

12:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt and Mischief the sleeping large black felo on it.

12:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "Back to Old Frontier we go. Now that i've cleared up some confusion heh."

12:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

12:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

12:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

12:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.

12:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:27 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

12:27 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

12:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

12:27 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

12:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:06 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

17:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, doesn't mean it's something to laugh about."

17:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we handled it. The nice thing about those is that there are no chains to worry about."

17:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So we can retreat as needed."

17:07 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

17:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Just bloody LRLs."

17:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

17:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'd almost take chains.. over LRLs."

17:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "UNLESS..."

17:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I had a -really- good laser-resistant hull plating."

17:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I just mean that the chains prevent you from leaving in an emergency."

17:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So long as you stick close to the edge, you can probably withdraw quickly without taking too much damage from the lasers as you do."

17:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

17:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if nobody wants to nest."

17:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to haul some asteroids or do some tesla?"

17:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It would be a 2 person nest.. at the moment, I think?"

17:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, we can't do that."

17:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

17:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nope.. we can't. Though.. it would be pretty wicked."

17:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not wicked.. epic."

17:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I did once do a three person nest."

17:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It was slow but manageable."

17:11 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

17:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A league.. and a rental.. think we could manage it."

17:11 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on League Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the one-person fighter "Deathstrike".

17:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

17:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Kim, do you know how the batteries on ships you attach to platforms and the smaller modular vessel add up?"

17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "When do IFS generally start showing up at beacons? Or is it completely random?"

17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think a sightseer attached to the small modular destroyer would have more charge than our scout does?"

17:15 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

17:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, that's for sure. After just doing one..."

17:22 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

17:23 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

17:23 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heya folks."

17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli."

17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got less than a billion for all those artifacts. I didn't expect such diminishing returns."

17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Raising all that money is going to take a lot longer than I thought."

17:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You've gotta be kidding me, less than a billion?"

17:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."

17:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In the past I've received a billion for about 70, so I was expecting a lot more."

17:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Wel, I believe there's an artifact trip coming up, you should try to come along, that will get you way more."

17:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I definitely will."

17:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was hoping to have a shuttle by then so I wouldn't waste as much space in whoever's carrier."

17:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still need 44 points for one."

17:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Who's leading that trip? And, hey eli."

17:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I believe it's a joint Libs and CAts thing."

17:30 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

17:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh.."

17:31 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

17:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Is that for the reguls sightseer Constainte, or you talking about the runabout? A lot of folks just bring a runabout with a speed plant on it."

17:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking a regular sightseer, as I don't have a way to obtain a runabout."

17:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If there's enough room, you might even be able to bring your void piercer."

17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "After studying the ships I determined that the void piercer isn't any faster than our scout, actually."

17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is disappointing."

17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Uh, it definitely is, not by much but it is."

17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the only real advantage is its better battery, but I doubt I'd be artifacting for two days straight on the trip anyway."

17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, really?"

17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah I mean it gets over 30k KMS with not plant."

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh sorry, I'm not fully awake yet."

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I will get one of those, then."

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I thought you already had one?"

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I was thinking about it for a while."

17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Ather's book made me think it wasn't any faster, since both the scout and the piercer have a 10% speed bonus."

17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or something, I can't remember."

17:34 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The scout bonus isn't listed in his book, but it does have it."

17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Using a scout with a double speed plant it's still pretty close, and then you have weapons in case there's interdictors."

17:35 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

17:35 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

17:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I wonder if it's worth trying it out. They're quite expensive."

17:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well I don't know, it kind of is but kind of isn't. You can get stuck somewhere pretty easy with a Piercer if there's interdictors."

17:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true. I guess My use case would just be artifacting. I don't think interdictors would ever be a problem for me at the bubble, since I could just land and use my bastille to deal with them."

17:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assume the trip is going to have a similar setup? A central station that will get hit by pirates occasionally, but I wouldn't really need to worry about interdictors while actually artifacting?"

17:38 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.

17:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah that's very strange it does only say 110% crusing speed listed at the shop, I'm not sure what's going on with stuff like that at the moment. My scout for example is only as fast as my combat scout, and the combat scout has no plant."

17:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, your exploration scout with a plant is slower than the combat scout?"

17:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, they're the exact same speed."

17:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my scout does 26667."

17:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

17:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, and the combat scout has no plant? Crazy."

17:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have a piercer? What does that get?"

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they would just stop being lame and sell us arrows."

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How fast is the top speed on your scout constantine."

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe we should do an AEU-organized trip someday. Like not by a particular org. Just show them the whole corps wants to explore."

17:41 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on League Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the one-person fighter "Deathstrike".

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "26667."

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Huh, yeah that's strange."

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'd be up for that. And be glad to go on it."

17:42 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's my plan,  just waiting to see if Ather can do something about skims first, after that I'll be putting on together."

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So do you have a piercer?"

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Can't wait for the meeting on saturday."

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a meeting?"

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, I used to, but I didn't want to get stuck with interdictors anymore. I used to use it as my primary ship."

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ather says it's mandatory."

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mandatory?"

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Since I liked that it was a compeltely peaceful ship."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like the strike was mandatory."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There will be a more official announcement to come, I believe."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Apparently, it'll be an imporatant meeting."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure it's about the skims."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I doubt I'll be around Saturday, but hopefully it goes well."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Depending on the time. I don't know if I'll be there or not. I hope I can be... myself."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If we don't get skim access back, then I"ll either be borrowing someone elses ship for a trip, or taking a bare bones platform. Honestly taking the latter might show them even more that we're serious."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I was thinking."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I told Lily I intend to organize one in the next month or two."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And she was urging me not to bother putting a ship together, since I won't be able to get any upgrades."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What we need to learn to do, is rift over that way. Screw the skims.."

17:46 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I think if we show them we can make money using the scraps we have, maybe they'll release more stuff to us."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can't buy upgrades that way Johnathan."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think we could already do that if we wanted, it's just far."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And we still couldn't buy stuff, yeah."

17:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can also just get someone to carry a ship over in a carrier for you, but the techs over there aren't suptid. They know our ships are not supposed to be over there so they won't let you buy the upgrades."

17:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I need someone to bring me out there so I can get a platform and the destroyer thingie."

17:48 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

17:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What a huge pain that is."

17:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What other interesting things can I do with a platform when I'm not exploring on it?"

17:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can I make a cargo ship larger than a medium transport somehow?"

17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think you can actually, with the United Freight shuttles."

17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting. Now would that be able to carry a salvage grapple? I know the shuttles can't individually."

17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or would that only be useful for trading."

17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I honestly don't know."

17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll have to experiment."

17:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure there are many that would disagree with me, but I also think it makes a decent heavy hitter gunship with 3 bombers onit. There's probably a slew of reasons others have about that to say that I'm wrong."

17:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting."

17:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It would then be a gunship with 6 tops or minicannsons on it."

17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. rops, torps.. I think I need to go back to sleep."

17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "John and I did a beacon a little while earlier in some kind of torpedo boat gunship."

17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought the ship was weirdly lightly armed."

17:52 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It only had three launchers."

17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So such a platform would at least have more weapons than that."

17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think that torpedo boat gets a bonus to torpedos though."

17:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I hadn't thought of that."

17:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, I can't imagine it would be as big of a bonus as getting hit with six minis all at once."

17:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm.. where is a good place to look for local artifacts?"

17:54 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

17:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Battle of Mir."

17:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "777 and Battle of Mir are good."

17:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you need a reactionless jet though."

17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh... that would explain why i've never found anything..."

17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's not like the SVP missions where you salvage the probe."

17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You also have to scan the rundown yourself unless you have an artifact detector."

17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. that's what I've been doing."

17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh."

17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, I've also been search Mir.. not battle of mir.."

17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ok... I'm going back to sleep folks.. I can not talk right yet."

17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ni]ht Eli""

17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nor can I."

17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

21:00 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not much at the moment, just relaxing. About to go do a thing."

21:04 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah, cool. Stone and I did to Tesla mining sites... those were interesting, with just the two of us."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The first we did, didn't know if we'd make it out in one piece."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah good deal. Yeah Tesla can be pretty cool actually."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "There were... one, with the leader, at the end of the site."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Especially when you have a newer license, they tend to assign you sites that don't have poachers early on when you are by yourself. At least they used to."

21:06 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, most of my sites still, don't have poachers."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, we did a couple of the biggers sites, because the small ones were... more or less, like a walk in the park."

21:10 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if you guys were around earlier when I tried, but we can't rent from Agnarr's anymore."

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Long term ship rentals at least, I know cadets have rental suits, so that must still work."

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah? That's crazy. I know someone was able to get the rental suits."

22:56 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Dman, that guy will sell to anyone."

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah, I tried to go get a platform today."

22:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And they wouldn't let you, or it was just unavailable?"

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They wouldn't even show me what ships they rent."

23:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. this was at the long-term rental place?"

23:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, on Helios."

23:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Was wondering why it was so quite. Helps if you turn your comms back on."

23:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

23:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I guess it makes sense, in a way, because in theory we can't take the skims to get it ack and it would have an AEU transponder after it's purchased, and we're not allowed to have ships over there."

23:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Constantine, get your letter?"

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true, I suppose."

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, better luck next time for us."

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, no kidding."

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You're perfectly allowed to have ships in Mutuality space. There is a difference between having access to the QSA, and being allowed onto the Mutuality stations."

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "He owes us one, at any rate."

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably ok to get the sutis, because a suit is not a ship and has no transpodner."

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe we'll get more someday."

23:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Disappointing. I've been drooling over that platform for a while."

23:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You sure about that ATher? It seems like ti's circumventing the idea that they don't want our ships coming through."

23:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I assumed that's why they won't let us put upgrades and stuff on."

23:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If they had issues allowing us onto their stations, they would've told Constantine to go fuck himself when he tried to dock."

23:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It was a league ship I docked in, but I think you're right. If we did find ourselves over there, the free port doctrine would still allow us to dock."

23:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Wouldn't telling him to fuck off, without a blacklisting, be violating free port doctrine?"

23:07 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo suddenly jumps onto a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top.

23:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Precisely. So by your same argument, wouldn't denying him landing clearance if he hasn't committed any crime also be a violation?"

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, that's the same thing that I just said."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just don't get the rationale. Like you want to close the skim off the Union navy, fine, but why don't they want my money."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not your money that's the issue."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's the tech-sharing. I think this is the relaly big issue that you all had issues with when you went to negotiate the QSA access."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The negotiators don't know the differences between some of the things that were being negotiated."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, and if they could allow civilian ships through and not the navy they would be more willing to do that. But I'm told that it doesn't work that way."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

23:09 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's all a really big drag, if you ask me."

23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it."

23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is definitely a shame."

23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Really limits us as AEU civilian pilots.."

23:11 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "More or less, in exploration."

23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Especially when it comes to things for the Rift drive."

23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It only limits you if you cannot expand your horizons and improvize."

23:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Farport only sells one useful piece of technology which would be useful for the rift drive."

23:12 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

23:12 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

23:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "When the rift drive was first released to us, we didn't have any of that stuff at Farport. In fact, Farport didn't even exist yet."

23:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where's everything else?"

23:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You're assuming that there are a lot of things available for the rift drive. It is a false assumption."

23:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it and goes to sleep.

23:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "A lot of the good stuff that comes on the rift drive, usually comes preinstalled on some exploration-specialized ships."

23:13 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

23:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "All we had when rift drive was first released to us for exploration, was rift drive. That's it."

23:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm just going off what your book says. And, no.. not just for the rift drive, ather.. but that operates along side it in exploration.."

23:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "For example, the MK II, only comes on certain vessels like the galleon and the augmented explorer, or the bolt. The MK III comes only on the science vessel, as far as I'm aware of. They're pieces of exploration we can't get anyway."

23:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Mind you.. nothing that I'd be able to get any time in near future."

23:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'ms ure he just means stuff like the furance and the hypercaster, butt like I said, we didn't have that stuff at first anyways."

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It can be done without any of that."

23:15 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

23:15 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hell, we didn't have platforms when rift drive came out, either."

23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Before, we would use cruisers to explore, or just about anything that had a day or more's worth of charge."

23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You new pilots are being spoiled by knowing that there are newer, superamazing pieces of technology out there which can make your lives easier."

23:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's all us newer pilots will be able to use for a while, to explore on our own. I'm still using my cargo hauler as my exploration vessel.. because of the charge it has on it."

23:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And, everything I do, is all done manually."

23:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Do I look forward to some of the better ships.. and tech. yes. I do. Greatly."

23:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Mostly, because I look forward to visiting some distant places that my hauler can't exactly take me to."

23:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily was telling me that a hypercaster is all but essential."

23:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What is the function of a hypercaster?"

23:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's for communication, I think."

23:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "How is the hypercaster essential? It doesn't help with the NDB, or anything like that."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, none of the farport stuff seemed essential to me, even for getting yourself unlost, or whatever."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's only really really useful if you're intending to blab a bunch of random jibberish around to people."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's what I was thinking."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well no, I'm not going to say that the farport stuff is not useful at all. Far from it, in fact."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Everything there has its uses. Even that shitty low-powe rhigh-output pile of shit."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ok... a more serious question. Where does one get the riftdrive from?"

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Useful for sure, but I was content to just build my platform without one."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The torus."

23:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Without any, rather."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Thanks Ather."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's all that concerns me."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which you'd know if you read the book, since it's in there!"

23:24 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So what's the Bolt?"

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't know what page anymore in the older edition, since I'm still working on the new one."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I've read the book.. a few times. And still use it. But.. I can't remember where it could be found."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know Jonathan Gray lost one."

23:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But who can normally buy them?"

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one."

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They were a prototype design, and there are only two in the hands of civilian pilots now."

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see. Who has them?"

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anfisa has one, I have the other."

23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I flew on some weird ships earlier."

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Define weird."

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A fringe gunship that had 5 chains and one launcher in each room, I think."

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What was the bolt?"

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It didn't seem that great. Maybe it doesn't require many points."

23:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The bolt is an exploration vessel with some experimental technologies on it."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then we briefly stepped into a cruiser that had only 3 chains and a launcher in weapon room 1, which I thought was a weird setup."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The biggest piece of experimental technology is the ability to create rift storms, which is often more of a hindrance than a help."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah... what kind of experimental tech?"

23:27 Mischief the large black felo gazes at Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah. Right."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting. Like storms to use to travel faster?"

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I remember Gray was talking about that.."

23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Like riftstorms."

23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, if you're -lucky- they can make storms that will help you travel faster. If you're unlucky, as bolt storms often tend to be, you'll get a strange storm, which will teleport you randomly around, to the point where you will probably end up somewhere completely unintended."

23:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

23:29 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... I've heard about those on the last trip.. we were lucky not to find any."

23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You won't find too many strange storms outside of the ones the bolt generates."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ok! That's a relief."

23:30 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Chopsticks". The organization has earned 2,682,099.74 credits.

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And riftstorm detectors are purchased by someone who has the blueprints to make them. So, if you do find one, you can hopefully navigate around it."

23:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like I said, if there is sufficient determination, nothing can stop someone from exploring."

23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Fairly accurate. I went on the last trip as a cadet.. came back with lots of pictures."

23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I don't even mean piggybacking on someone else's ship."

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Truth be told.. there's not a lot a cadet can do. We're pretty limited... But, understandablely so."

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Regarding exploring."

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "On our own.."

23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm hoping for a response from the liaison office in the next couple of days, but even if I don't get one, I still want a meeting on Saturday with pilots! So, make time. I will announce the exact time via comm notice probably tomorrow. Mandatory, discussion of our futures, etc."

23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cadets are honestly not meant to explore."

23:35 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Agreed.."

23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

23:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cadets from -any- alliance."

23:41 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

23:43 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

23:43 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Too big of a sigh, in relief."

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The Mule has a pretty serious battery."

23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm a bit fuzzy on exploring in non-exploration-grade sensor ships. Is the thing with that that I have to manually check rift locations?"

23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or will it not detect the locations at all without an upgrade."

23:47 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

23:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The Star and Soothsayer have decent batteries as well."

23:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, I just had a tought. Would creating a rift storm help with geting away from an Outsider patrol? As in would Outsiders try to go around it instead of going through it?"

23:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the STar used to be decent for it, but now the sensors are terrible for exploration."

23:48 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Chopsticks". The organization has earned 1,776,144.42 credits.

23:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there not really any working around the sensor issue?"

23:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I still think it might be ok, just not as good, but I'm told that it's just a terrible idea all together."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably better to use a constructor or something if you are going to use a non-exploration vessel."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why a constructor?"

23:50 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For the obvious reason that you can build stations and go farther?"

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Because you can just shit out recharge stations."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I like that."

23:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And if you have a furance, you could also put out repair stations to repair it."

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. a furance."

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "Furnace."

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I could buy a constructor, but not a furnace."

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right? Isn't that farport?"

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah taht's farpiot, but you could still just shit out reharge stations."

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah! I like that idea."

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Goddamnit, I can't talk right."

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know what you mean."

23:52 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

23:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "With space for 28 modules, could I carry 7 recharge stations?"

23:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Top, core, battery, and the recharge module?"

23:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or do those require more parts."

23:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You would need a battery as well."

23:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh you said battery."

23:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah. So just 4 parts for each station."

23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think so yeah."

23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's pretty good, I'd get almost 60 hours of charge out of that, if I timed the recharges really well."

23:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus whatever extra time the feinstein sink gets me."

23:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The mod transport actually gets a bit more charge too, it doesn' have to be a constructor."

23:55 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

23:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Plus, it has quarters."

23:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't think about that, but it does have more charge."

23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And it's cheaper."

23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The constructor doesn't have quarters? That's sad."

23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is a good place for gathering debris?"

23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "About... grade 20."

23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Belt of orion."

23:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

23:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Try around dusty reaches and spinward cluster."

23:59 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
