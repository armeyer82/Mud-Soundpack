00:16 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

00:27 Several snowglobes stacked vertically hover past at high speed.

00:37 Two skeletons riding skeletal horses draw alongside the hovertruck bed briefly and stare across at you, blue points of light glittering in their empty eyesockets.

00:40 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

00:48 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

00:48 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

01:10 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:18 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

01:24 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

01:38 The ship lands on a square marked "Roll Again!" Dice roll, and the ship advances another few squares.

01:48 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

01:49 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

01:50 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

01:59 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

02:00 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

05:02 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

05:02 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

05:02 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

05:02 Lily Kaise says, "Ok so i'll put her back on the bed with us. I was thinking she might not sleep but I am not sure."

05:03 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "I guess I'll just put her in the snuggly and put that on the bed."

05:42 You venture through a side door.

05:42 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

05:42 A single star appears brighter than the rest here. The ship's sensors indicate that you have likely arrived in the vicinity of a planetary system. Early indications are that this is a gas giant-centric system, which will tend to possess one or two gas supergiants and perhaps a rocky planet or two.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:42 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ooh."

05:50 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

05:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:58 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

07:32 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just a smidge more."

07:35 The blast chamber shuts down, having fully charged the starship.

07:36 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

07:36 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

07:36 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

07:36 The starship has left a unique area of space.

07:36 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "K.ENG charge, ahoy!"

07:36 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

08:27 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

08:37 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

08:38 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

08:38 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

08:46 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

09:06 The computer announces, "Incoming QE message from AFW Command."

09:08 A battle-weary and grim-looking officer briskly walks by with a wooden stock rifle slung over his shoulder.

09:10 Enemy gunfire erupts at the far end of the trench, and a group of soldiers rush over to defend the area.

09:11 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

09:18 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

09:27 The computer announces, "QE message from AFW Command received."

09:28 A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.

09:39 A mortar explodes off in the distance, causing the ground to shake slightly.

09:41 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

09:41 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

09:45 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

09:56 The deck suddenly jumps under your feet as you hear a heavy thud from deep inside the starship.

09:56 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

09:57 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Time to repair!"

10:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

10:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

10:12 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

10:12 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

10:12 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

10:12 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

10:21 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

10:42 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

10:45 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

10:55 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

11:06 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

11:08 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

11:14 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

11:14 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

11:26 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

11:44 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

11:54 A sudden gust of cold air blows through the starship bringing the scents of stone and ancient, moldering flesh.

12:01 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

12:12 Curtains of dangling silk stick to the ship as it pushes through them, obscuring the view from the windows briefly before pulling away.

12:16 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

12:16 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

13:12 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

13:20 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

13:20 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

15:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:27 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

15:27 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

15:27 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

15:27 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

15:28 The starship has left a unique area of space.

15:28 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

15:28 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

15:29 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

15:29 A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startlingly like a single unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

15:29 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uh..."

15:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:29 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sup?"

15:29 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not exactly sure."

15:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:30 You hear a solid thunk sound as something is expelled from the storage room.

15:32 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gonzales?"

15:33 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright, all full."

15:33 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

15:34 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

15:34 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

15:34 The starship has left a unique area of space.

15:37 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's the status of the furnace?"

15:38 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

15:42 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Only 35 percent ware on the furnace, much better using that stuff than what we originally used."

15:43 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'll be dead if anyone needs me."

15:43 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well we now have more of it."

15:43 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please don't die!"

15:43 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Die in peace, Gonzales."

15:43 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Fine. I will live in peace then. Making peopel happy is hard."

15:44 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's all I needed, Gonzales. Rest well."

15:44 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thank you!"

15:45 I don't see that here.

16:04 Something tickles the back of your neck.

16:06 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

16:06 The room grows a bit warmer.

16:07 The room grows a bit more chill.

16:17 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

16:17 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If anyone knows how far we had traveled before we hit that prestellar, please put it on the board."

16:18 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

16:19 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

16:27 You hear something fall in the next room.

16:35 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

16:53 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

16:53 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

17:05 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

17:08 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay."

17:08 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Horrible people."

17:08 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let's go."

17:10 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else?"

17:15 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

17:23 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

17:32 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

17:34 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

17:35 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

17:35 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

17:36 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

17:38 Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

18:05 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

18:15 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

18:25 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

18:36 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

18:36 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

18:36 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

19:06 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

19:08 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

19:19 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

19:29 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

19:37 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

19:47 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

20:07 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

20:17 Something tickles the back of your neck.

20:28 You hear something fall in the next room.

20:29 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Everything ok? I heard something fall."

20:29 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just the rift messing with us."

20:29 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oy. Figured as much."

20:38 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

20:39 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

20:52 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

21:09 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

21:19 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

21:23 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

21:34 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

21:40 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

21:40 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

21:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Down to 15%, means we're at 850 Light-years!"

21:51 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Whoa."

22:10 A small vehicle pulls alongside, kicking up dust, before speeding ahead.

22:14 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

22:15 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo our speed has dropped."

22:24 A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.

22:25 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

22:34 The ship turns and speeds across the plain for a short distance before finding another road.

22:35 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

22:35 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

22:36 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

22:40 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Going fast again!"

22:40 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Zoom zoom."

22:41 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

22:41 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

22:50 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

23:08 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

23:19 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

23:29 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

23:40 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

23:43 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

23:44 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.
