00:20:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:20:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:34:48 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:34:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:34:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:34:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:34:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:35:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:35:08 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Ardsley Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:35:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:35:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Campeche."

00:35:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:35:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:35:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:35:15 The ship has arrived in the Campeche cluster, a solar system filled with a wealth of colonizable planets.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:35:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Ardsley Orbit."

00:35:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:35:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:35:20 There are no other ships in the sector.

00:35:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Ardsley in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:35:23 AutoStar detects 1 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

00:35:23 Via general sector communication, Ardsley transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Ardsley Orbit!"

00:35:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Ardsley.

00:35:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:36:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:36:11 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:36:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:36:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:36:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:36:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:36:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:36:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

00:36:35 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:36:35 You exit the ship.

00:50:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:50:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:50:12 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:50:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

00:50:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:50:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:50:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Calm. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:50:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:50:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:50:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:50:38 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

00:50:48 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Residential Structure.

00:50:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:51:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:51:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:51:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:51:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:51:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:51:24 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:52:20 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:52:20 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

07:24:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Did we ever pin down how much the AEU pays the Accord each month?"

07:24:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or get some kind of ballpark."

07:51:49 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "No one is doing anything? Someone must have an idea!"

07:57:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, The Accord couldn't really give a number because a lot of what we send isn't really credits."

07:57:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's like personnel, and equipment."

08:01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That makes sense."

08:01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was just trying to think about doing some napkin math. The only way I can think to really put the squeeze on the government would be to make sure the Union saw no financial gain from leaving the Accord."

08:02:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'm not even sure the strike and merchant blockage combined add up to a large enough number."

08:02:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Certainly not to the, what was it, 500 billion Best quoted?"

08:02:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well one good thing, is have you heard our conquest guy? This will be our least productive period yet I think."

08:04:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cadets have high attrition in general, though. It might be hard to pin down an exact cause."

08:04:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And yeah the figure given in the press was five hundred billion a week which is yeah, a bit out there as far as sums go."

08:05:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, a week? Damn."

08:05:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If that's even close to being accurate..."

08:05:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, no amount of merchant blocking or striking will help."

08:05:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I got bored today and pulled 70 artifacts out of the bubble."

08:05:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's probably about a billion credits they won't be able to tax until the strike ends, but still."

08:06:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's nowhere near 500 billion a week."

08:06:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "According to Shea, it's misleading at best, because of it not being credits."

08:06:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

08:07:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The idea of putting a credit value on something like personnel seems maybe just a bit sleazy."

08:08:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but potentially necessary from an accounting perspective."

08:09:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Very true."

08:09:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "These are the kinds of things that factor into their calculus in the negotiations, I'm sure."

08:12:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've still heard nothing about whether the govnerment has asked the office to try to end the strike."

14:13:24 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Sup."

14:14:23 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I swear that's the only word I ever hear you say these days."

14:20:28 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's the song of my people."

14:20:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The only one?"

14:21:15 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "We're not super diverse."

14:21:30 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My work is done."

14:22:34 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I thought y'all were going back to the thing out there. Is that over now?"

14:23:23 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I haven't been over at all, but I didn't see any ops in the last 24 hours."

14:23:42 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Hello."

14:24:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

14:28:22 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Oh, I thought you were one of the people who got blown up with Damien."

14:29:17 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nope, not me, last time I found I wasn't awake enough when ops happened, so this time I didn't go, always too quiet for them at this time of day."

14:32:56 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Who got blown up where?"

14:34:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nasty sounding attack on one of the salvage ops on the trip."

14:34:28 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Nine Outsiders, lots of warpers, and interdicted."

14:35:08 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And I heard you were flying, and I know how good an evader you can be, and that you would have tried to get the interdictors if you could."

14:35:32 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I don't know what warpers and interdiction means, but it sounds really bad."

14:35:53 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Interdiction means no escape."

14:35:57 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Yeah, except we didn't know exactly who the interdictors were. The rapid wouldn't leave off Johann's transport and so we spent the first part chasing that fool around the sector."

14:36:19 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, rapids have to go first, they are a royal pain."

14:36:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It was you and Johann, two of our best for that kind of situation."

14:37:08 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "We think however that the one interdicting was the martial fighter. At least we were allowed to leave after it was destroyed, but all the warpers were gone by then too, so we are unsure about that point."

14:37:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We seem to be seeing more and more warpers."

14:38:13 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Egil, to explain here, interdictors prevent ships from leaving the sector by any means, and assault warping is a nasty upgrade some Outsider ships have where they teleport right next to you guns blazing."

14:39:19 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "That's cheating."

14:39:30 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Sure is."

14:39:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Wait till you meet the IFS, with their long range lasers."

14:40:00 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Real fighters get up close and personal, no less than a couple of kilometers, tops."

14:40:19 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "More, even."

14:40:28 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I wouldn't say things like that if I were you, everybody has different ways of fighting."

14:41:54 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I was just joking about distance. A fist fight equivalent in space would still have the ships really, really far apart."

14:44:40 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Alright, let's see, what to do..."

14:44:58 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Tesla?"

14:45:21 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I can't do anything right now."

14:45:55 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Lame."

14:46:32 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Tesla?"

14:47:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You need a battlesuit plus 20 million to register."

14:47:42 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I can afford that."

14:48:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Do you have a battlesuit yet?"

14:48:27 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I have a tier 1 AEU suit."

14:48:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Cool."

14:48:56 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Teslaworld, to explain further, is a planet ravaged by crazy radiation and electrical storms. It also happens to have valuable resources underground and a fuckton of tunnels."

14:49:43 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Ohh."

14:50:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

14:50:34 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's pretty neat."

14:50:57 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm half dozing doing a mine right now, so if I go quiet, you know why."

14:51:34 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "How's the pay?"

14:52:17 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "We use our battlesuits to mine those resources and do battle with illegal poachers who want the stuff for themselves. Pay is decent and versatile, you get to choose whether you want more points or more credits."

14:52:43 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "And like many activities, the more you do it, the more lucrative it gets."

14:53:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:53:35 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Sounds convenient!"

14:54:07 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Even better, you can do it alone or with others."

14:54:49 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I get the feeling Tesla is one of your favorite things."

14:55:00 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's pretty great."

14:55:28 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'm also bored and tired and thus prone to rambling."

14:56:18 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad laughs.

14:56:43 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Informative rambling! Thanks."

14:56:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we're not even on the board! Let's do some piloting!"

14:57:43 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I know how confusing pilot talk is at first, and there aren't a lot of people who take the time to explain all the terminology and such to cadets."

14:59:00 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "At least not in the middle of conversation."

14:59:57 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I appreciate it. There's a lot to take in."

15:02:40 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Have I asked whether you've done all your SVP missions yet?"

15:02:59 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad laughs. "No, but Ted has."

15:03:06 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I haven't yet, by the way."

15:03:42 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "If you need help with any of those let me know."

15:04:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:05:09 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "...provided I'm not already curled up in bed."

15:05:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

15:05:54 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I will. I can't do anything that needs even a bit of focus right now, though."

15:06:37 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "I'm taking you up on that offer one of these days, though!"

15:06:46 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Kay."

15:07:55 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "In that case, fuck being awake right now. See y'all later."

15:08:08 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Good night."

You can go south and out.

16:29:30 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

16:29:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

16:30:24 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:30:24 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:30:25 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:30:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:30:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:30:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:30:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:30:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:30:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:30:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:30:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:30:50 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.

22:44:57 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not paying attention to what I'm doing power."

22:45:12 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I'd help if it made any sense to."

22:46:18 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Anything you can think of on your side of things would be helpfull, even little things. We gotta stop this before we all end up in a war."

22:59:13 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "We need to work something out."

22:59:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Actually if I remember correctly, someone from the mutuality asked mister K directly about that here on general, and he said he wouldn't have an issue with you being on ops."

22:59:46 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  you guys get in trouble with it? I mean it's not really in Mutuality space."

22:59:50 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "That was for the last op thing, right?"

22:59:59 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Or did they ask about this one too?"

23:01:38 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I'll ask Aisling when she gets on comms."

23:01:50 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Could always just ask Kelsey, he might be listening."

23:02:16 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "This gives me hope."

23:02:38 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It came up because they were putting an op station out at 285, so someone asked if that meant the mutuality couldn't take part in ops."

23:04:09 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It really would suck if we never could again, so yeah, I like this news."

23:06:45 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Crap, explosion on new earth?"

23:06:46 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Whoa, did somebody blow up at new earth?"

23:07:03 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's fine. The pain!"

23:07:05 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Wait, there wasn't even a fight."

23:07:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What the hell? Eli, what happened?"

23:08:19 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Oh, that ship exploding thing."

23:09:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I've just been busy."

23:09:08 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Eli did..."

23:09:14 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It's like a protest."

23:09:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Asteroid hauler."

23:09:26 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You blew up your own ship?"

23:09:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Did you just, slam your hauler into new earth?"

23:10:02 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, I didn't crash it, I destructed it."

23:10:11 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well as the news feeds say, glory to the civilian fleet."

23:10:16 [General Communication] Angel Martin giggles.

23:10:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh, right...I follow now. sanity on a cupcake I was freaking out for a second. never mind me."

23:10:36 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'll assume you had a good reason."

23:10:42 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, you didn't think to bring a smaller craft along to make your escape? It'd probably have been better than a rescue pod."

23:11:05 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They seem to think that they can just ignore what we're doing, so I thought I'd give them somethign ot notice."

23:11:11 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Pod rides. I avoid those whenever I can."

23:11:20 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was a very short pod ride."

23:11:20 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "At least it was a short pod ride."

23:11:31 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well it does get one's attention."

23:11:46 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I know it'd get mine."

23:12:05 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well guys, I'll talk to you all later."

23:12:17 [General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Bye bye."

23:12:26 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You crazy regs."

23:12:38 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Our goals are lower than they've been in a very long time. Somebody somewhere's gotta be pissed about that. Especially with all the ops going on."

23:12:59 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Um Eli, there's only one problem with this action."

23:13:22 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I told Evangeline she could teach me all about explosions. You apparently didn't get the memo."

23:13:46 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh sorry, you're saying I should have invited you to come watch?"

23:13:57 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes among other things."

23:14:00 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Oh, I thought you were going to say something like shutting down the pilot corps, ending subsidies, something like that."

23:14:26 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sssh, cheri. Do'nt give them any ideas."

23:14:35 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's not the reaction we want."

23:14:50 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well there is a danger."

23:15:14 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I'm not saying that you are wrong. You are surely right that there's risks we're taking over here."

23:15:19 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "But then, there's always danger."

23:15:24 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."

23:15:47 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And being in a war while the Outsiders are just waiting for the right moment to take us all out is a much greater risk."

23:16:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Agreed. That's the part that worries hell out of me."

23:17:16 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well good luck with all this, not much we can do without somebody saying it's a provocation."

23:17:46 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Rats fighters in orion, about 5 of them."

23:18:03 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'll come back with my fighter once I have dumped this load of salvage."

23:21:47 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."

23:21:54 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I must have missed someone getting orion?"

23:21:54 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "But one thing I noticed was on flight control they didn't even seem surprised when the ship blew up, so they might be getting used to it."

23:22:04 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hiya Hakeem."

23:22:22 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe."

23:30:36 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well I have hit two small plateaus, but neat nonetheless. I just cleared 1 k industry and 1500 aggregate."

23:30:45 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nice job Lex."

23:30:52 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip cheers for Lexie Amarras!

23:33:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:33:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
