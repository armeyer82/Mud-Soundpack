-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.

01:41 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

02:05 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

02:05 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:05 There is one board post.

02:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Did Kim get her suit?"

02:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No for some reason, the officer told her that he couldn't do much for her now."

02:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh wow, so she didn't even get assigned?"

02:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No."

02:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow."

02:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Constantine had the same issue but we thought perhaps for other reason. Kim had over 3500 Space and qualifies for at least an AEU 5 so she should be able to do this mission."

02:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Woo I have a felo in suspended animation."

02:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Eek that is creepy."

02:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, I'm honestly not sure why Kim couldn't get assigned to the mission."

02:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I love every pet I've had and I miss all of them but I couldn't watch them look so distressed in that state."

02:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So I'll just let them go on to wherever old felo pass onto."

02:13 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...A-59's been clear. Sorry, forgot bout it."

02:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Anyway, it might be in order to inquire of the Liaison whether or not any future AEU will be able to do this mission."

02:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

03:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Steve."

03:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Welcome to the corps."

03:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:03 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

04:03 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.

You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.

04:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:04 The AEU did not reach any of its performance goals.

04:04 Top Performers: Constantine Stone, Lily Kaise, and Kim Saunders.
The current Conquest period began 2 days, 3 hours, 3 minutes, and 22 seconds ago. The period will end in 1 day, 20 hours, and 56 minutes.

04:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:04 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:04 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:04 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:04 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:04 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:04 AutoStar detects 5 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Fearless! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:04 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:05 I don't understand that.

04:05 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:05 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:05 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]

19:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:58 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

19:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:58 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

19:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:58 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.

19:59 You peer out...

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The four-person mule "Waka", the three-person flying wing "Hawkwing", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.

20:00 Hank Marvelstine says, "Hi."

20:00 You wave.

20:00 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

20:00 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

20:01 Hank Marvelstine says, "This is hawkwing 2.0, so to speak."

20:01 Hank Marvelstine says, "My first one blew up in a major outisder fire."

20:01 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

20:01 Hank Marvelstine says, "So meh."

20:01 Gonzales Bourne sprints out.

20:01 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the four-person mule "Simulated Surprise" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

20:01 You say to Hank, "It's ok. I can fly if you need me to."

20:01 Hank Marvelstine says, "Na I have learned a lot since then."

20:02 You grin at Hank Marvelstine.

20:02 You say to Hank, "I'm sure you'll be fine."
