Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving

I was extremely hurt though when you let Lily completely disrespect me by

I didn't out you, but I could have. I let her run my name through the mud.

Hi love,
Well, I hope you still love me after you read this. I don't wish to make this a
public spectacle, but I should tell you before Evenia decides to say something.
As I feared, according to her, I did flirt back and cheat on you. She hasn't
said anything to anyone about it so she says, but if she does talk.... I'm
afraid she's going to make me look very bad, bad enough that you may want to
walk away from me. I promise that I have always loved you and I will always only
love you.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

definitely are."

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "What's your plan though?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Perhaps we can iron it out so
you don't have to make a second trip. Discuss and shoot, and all that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "League. Fringe. AEU.
Mutuality."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Or could help people like me
who still want to do theirs!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's not a bad plan. You can
use the Mutuality to erode her, and the Fringe can do what it does best."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's the plan. I mean I
can always try again if this doesn't work."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Knockout doesn't work on either
of them? Has that been confirmed by now? Or is it just supposition?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I believe it was confirmed."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I swear it did."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I swore it did too, Johann."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I swear we knocked out mother
and killed megabat."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Rats are always getting
smarter."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's what I use to do back in
the day when I tanked those nests."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "That is true, and
unfortunately our battlesuits don't get any better equipped to deal with them."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I've tried to knock out both of
them at least 3 times. Maybe fourth time is the charm."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Okay. General going off so I
can concentrate without distractions. At least I'm in the suit I love and know
best."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "It's all about the birthday
suits."
[General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Well, now I'm sweaty and all
but that was excitin'."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in AEU/Debate.
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a
new notice.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah fine, I guess I'll stay
voice."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You guys doing OK on that
nest?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "So far we're surviving."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Survival is good! You pass the
halfway point?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Not quite. I can almost see
it though."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Try to knock out mother. See
what happens!"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I don't think anybody has it.
We're in tier three's."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, no, then you don't."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser

Enter your destination:
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly
Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship,
Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
