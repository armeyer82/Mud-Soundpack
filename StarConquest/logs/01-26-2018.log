00:00 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Nah I'm not in to flirting with other people's significant other's. It's wrong."

00:00 You say, "Shhhh, don't say that. I'd be very sad."

00:00 Over the line, Katina Faye laughs. "You wouldn't."

00:00 You say, "YEah, I agree."

00:00 You say, "Yes I would."

00:00 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I hardly call or anything."

00:00 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Okay sure heres more things to vent."

00:00 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Missions at midnight. An hour, if anyone is interested."

00:00 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "When I was with Michael he was basically my best friend at the time."

00:00 You say, "That's ok, I love hearing from you and seeing you around."

00:00 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I spend almost all my time with him."

00:00 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If I can engineer."

00:01 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Sure."

00:01 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Spent."

00:01 [Tactical Communication] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Me!"

00:01 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He knew how I viewed people and that I didn't trust many."

00:01 You say, "I figured as uch."

00:01 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Or lost my trust in them anyways."

00:01 You say, "Er, as much."

00:01 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Sure why not."

00:01 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'm up for it."

00:02 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Dunno it just hurts a bit to see him jump on the bandwagon because I broke it off, sometimes I think he's doing it because he's angry at me even though he says otherwise."

00:02 You say, "Awww."

00:02 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Yeah I'll go too."

00:02 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He's gone in with their crowd, heck I only told one person that I never had sex with Ali, and that was him, and now people know. That was something personal."

00:03 You exclaim, "Ouch!"

00:03 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It's just I opened completely up to him, and I fear he's exposing some of me that I don't wish to be exposed because he's doing to spite me."

00:03 You say, "That's not very nice and I hope he's not doing that."

00:03 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I don't think that is what one does when they love someone else."

00:03 You say, "I agree."

00:04 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Also he said he'd take a long time to move on from me because he said he really loved me."

00:04 You say, "Well, then he needs to understand that if you love someone, you need to let go of them and not do things to spite them."

00:04 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "But a few days later he's out sitting in the lounge wanting to see women blush and calling them to the lounge, and flirting with women."

00:04 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I mean I'm fine with that but."

00:05 You say, "I'm sorry Katina. That sounds rough."

00:05 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He can't say to my face that oh, he's all heartbroken over me and it will take a while, and he might even build a station far away and live out there all alone, blah blah, but then go make sexual comments over general and flirt in front of my face...it's not like I don't want him to, it's just...I don't know how to explain."

00:06 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He's a free man now, he may do as he wish."

00:06 You say, "You don't have to. I understand."

00:06 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Oh I guess this is it."

00:06 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I don't like him guilt tripping me but then act as if I haven't affected him."

00:06 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "There, that's it."

00:06 You say, "I understand."

00:06 You say, "I'm sorry."

00:07 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "So I confronted him about it and he said "Well I have to move on.""

00:07 You say, "Still, he should be respectful about it."

00:08 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm not opposed to that but I don't believe it's love when you appear to be heartbroken for only 2 days and try to make me feel bad, but then deliberately flirting in front of my face a few days later."

00:08 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:08 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It's silly."

00:08 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He told me he loved me a few days after he really got to know me, so there's the first red flag."

00:08 You say, "I agree with you though."

00:08 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "And we weren't even dating then."

00:09 You say, "YEah, that is strange."

00:09 You say, "I probably took way too long to tell Lily I loved her. And by the way, Lily was not looking for a relationship at all when she joined the pilot corps."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:10 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I wouldn't tell him I love him for a long time either. And even when I said it it didn't feel right."

00:10 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I even made him sad beause he'd tell me he love me, and I wouldn't say it back."

00:11 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'd just smile or whatever."

00:11 You say, "Well, I think he should have taken that into consideration. The fact that you didn't respond."

00:12 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "But at least I stopped pretending and let him go. Because it wasn't right. I really hope someone will come along and he won't be angry or have to wonder if they love him or not."

00:12 You ask, "I don't mean to be blunt, but maybe he just wanted you for the physical aspect?"

00:12 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I knew he'd move on quickly anyways after I broke it off."

00:13 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "So many reasons why I broke it off, all of which are realy not worth stressing over anymore. Thing are what they are."

00:13 You say, "Well, I'm sure you're a lovable person though."

00:13 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Sure I am, if I open up and not be scared to be loved."

00:13 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:13 You say, "Awwww."

00:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

00:14 You say, "But I understand."

00:14 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Oh and what you said abput the physical aspect."

00:14 Over the line, Katina Faye laughs. "Maybe."

00:14 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I mean some men are wicked. Here's a wench who's never made love to anyone, why not him be the first? That's just my synical side speaking though."

00:15 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Well made love to anyone in the core."

00:15 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Sorry for being so blunt, I'm very blunt."

00:15 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I hate sugarcoating."

00:15 You say, "You're fine."

00:15 You say, "I'm used to it from Lily."

00:15 You chuckle.

00:16 You say, "Well, I mean. You are very beautiful."

00:16 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Good because it's what I prefer. Bluntness."

00:16 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Yeah, why do you think I hide a lot and am shy."

00:16 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm not shy to the ones I trust though."

00:16 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Like Ali, he's my kindred."

00:16 You say, "YEah, I understand, but there are good guys out there."

00:17 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Sure, I think I dated one."

00:17 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "See how that ended?"

00:17 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:17 You say, "Awww."

00:18 You say, "Well, I hope you do find soeone to love and who will lov eyou."

00:18 You say, "Er, someone to love and who will love you."

00:18 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm a bit bothered, I really hope he won't go rattle off my weaknesses adn things to people. I'll really be heartbroken. I'm partly afraid of love because of betrayal."

00:19 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I've been betrayed so many times, I just don't have much faith in romance and love and all that."

00:19 I don't understand that.

00:19 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Might've thought Michael was actually decent but."

00:19 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Meh."

00:19 I don't understand that.

00:19 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He seemed very much so when I was his but now that I'm not, he's sort of being testy..."

00:19 You say, "I hope he won't too, but just remember who you are and the truth will reveal itself in time."

00:21 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I don't hate these people, I just am wary to hang with them. I try to be a good girl and socialize sometimes in the lounge, but I can't stand it so I just doze off or leave and find an excuse to leave."

00:21 You say, "Yep, been there done that. Though I wasn't trying to be a good girl."

00:21 I don't understand that.

00:21 You chuckle.

00:21 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:22 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I have a question."

00:22 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Not saying that I would anytime soon but."

00:22 You ask, "I've had to learn to behave now that I'm with Lily and what is your question?"

00:23 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "If I were to go home and actually not come back to the core, would it think gross if I left a lock of my hair and a love letter in a little bottle to someone I loved?"

00:23 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Or would you think it romantic. Heck I wonder what they would think."

00:23 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:23 You say, "I would think it would be roantic!!! but I hope you don't go home."

00:23 You say, "Romantic."

00:24 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm not planning to, permanently anyways."

00:24 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It can get lonely though."

00:24 You exclaim, "Good, if you did, I'd have to hunt you down and tickle you to death!"

00:24 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm glad I have Ali. He's my confidant."

00:25 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I cana laugh, or cry, or get pissed at him, and he won't walk away from me."

00:25 You say, "I'm glad you do have soeone to trust. That's iportant to have."

00:25 You say, "Important."

00:25 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "And he's allowed to tease me because I know he means to joke."

00:25 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Yeah, he's one of 2 people that haven't backstabbed me, that I am sure of."

00:26 You say, "That's good."

00:26 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "Oh, do you know about Jovan's redoubt?"

00:26 You ask, "No, what is that?"

00:26 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm not sure."

00:27 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It's um."

00:27 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "About 17 ly north and up from NQ."

00:27 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Perhaps it is an artifacting field but I did not go to check it out."

00:27 You say, "Ah ok."

00:27 You say, "I can't go to NQ though."

00:27 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "You guys could, I told you two, if you ever need a ride across the skim, ring me."

00:28 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "If I'm around that is."

00:28 You say, "True. You did say that."

00:28 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "If I feel abosuletly lonely one day, and I have a scout mojule, I might go check it out."

00:28 You ask, "So, did you go to the NQ party on New YEar's Eve or whatever?"

00:29 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Wends nagged me to go but."

00:29 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Said I was too busy."

00:29 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Which in truth I was."

00:30 You say, "Yeah, you don't seem the type to want to go there and strip naked or flash."

00:30 You laugh.

00:30 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "No sir. I am a good girl."

00:30 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Mostly."

00:30 You chuckle.

00:30 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm 100% a good girl once I'm taken though, no doubt about that."

00:30 You say, "I was not so good before I started to date Lily."

00:30 You chuckle.

00:31 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Its so weird though."

00:31 You ask, "What's so weird?"

00:31 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I wonder if people tisk tisk to know that I brought a gang of people to NQ and none of the single people romped or stripped naked or did anything naughty."

00:31 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:31 You laugh.

00:31 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It was KQ instead of NQ."

00:32 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "K for Katina."

00:32 You say, "Well, neither did some of the couples."

00:32 You chuckle.

00:32 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I mean people were free to do as they wished of course..."

00:32 You say, "Yeah, but most of us didn't want to make people like you uncomfortable."

00:32 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "But I wasn't that sort so I wasn't going to. I had to walk Lexi to her room and the ship though a couple times when she had too much to drink."

00:32 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:33 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "That really was a lovely trip."

00:33 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "There were no quarrels, people had a wonderful time, and everything went smoothely."

00:33 You exclaim, "It was an awesome trip!"

00:33 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "And people didn't leave early, so I took that as a good omen that they were enoying the trip."

00:33 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Enjoying."

00:33 I don't understand that.

00:33 You say, "Definitely."

00:34 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "How long do you think I should visit home?"

00:34 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I should ell you about Noah."

00:34 You say, "Hmm, not sure. I considered it for a couple of weeks."

00:35 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I wonder if he's at home."

00:35 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Noah was my very first lover."

00:35 You say, "Awww."

00:35 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He started off as my best friend though."

00:35 You say, "I named a ship after my first lover."

00:35 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "Really?"

00:35 You say, "Yep."

00:35 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I named a Felo after my first lover."

00:36 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:36 You say, "And I'd be devistated if it got destroyed."

00:36 You chuckle.

00:36 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I wanted to name my lizard after Noah but, I have lesser doubt that I'll ever get a beautiful lizard."

00:36 You say, "Well, at least you honored him somehow."

00:36 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "So I settled for a felo instead and named it Noah."

00:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Yeah Noah's quite the handsome dude."

00:37 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "The real one anyways, not the felo."

00:37 You say, "That's awesome.laugh."

00:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Yes, you're allowed to laugh."

00:37 You laugh.

00:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "Want to know what he looks like?"

00:38 You say, "My first lover was one of the people, really the ain person that pushed me to join piloting."

00:38 You say, "Sure."

00:38 You ask, "Tall, dark and hansome?"

00:38 You say, "Handsome."

00:38 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Ah well, Noah left me when I was in my eleventh grade in school back at home. We exchanged love letters for 2 years and then he went quiet."

00:38 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He went off to seek a higher education."

00:39 You say, "Ah ok."

00:39 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "So I waited for him for a year while trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life."

00:39 You say, "I bet that was tough."

00:40 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Then when I graduated from school, I spent a summer as a librarian for the town, but my parents discouraged me, and no sign of Noah, so I left to be a pilot."

00:40 You say, "Ah ok. Well, we're glad to have you."

00:40 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Well, he either found another lover because distance relationship is hard to some, or something happened to him."

00:41 You say, "Yeah, but I'm sure you miss him."

00:41 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I hope he's truely happy whereever he is though. And I can't help but wonder if he has made back to the the little town of Mercy Heights. Though it's a fleeting thought."

00:41 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "Miss him?"

00:41 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "No, I don't love him anymore."

00:42 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I might thrash him if I come home to visit and he's there, for abandoning me."

00:42 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:42 You say, "I still miss my first. At least a part of me does. She chose to stay behind and not join the pilot corps."

00:42 You chuckle.

00:42 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Oh that Noah."

00:42 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Oh right, his looks."

00:42 You say, "Right."

00:43 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He had a beautiful mop of curly raen locks on his head."

00:43 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Raven."

00:43 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "And um."

00:43 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He had gorgious green eyes."

00:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "And he was not buff and thick and muscular, but rather lith, and strong, and nimble."

00:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'm not pronouncing that right, I meant lithe."

00:44 You say, "I knew what you eant."

00:44 You say, "Meant."

00:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Okie."

00:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "We used to clim trees together when we were chilldrin."

00:44 You say, "Wow, sounds like you thought he was rather good-looking."

00:45 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "And he was tall."

00:45 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Oh man Shule, he is good looking."

00:45 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:45 You chuckle.

00:45 Over the line, Katina Faye sighs.

00:46 You laugh. "Yeah, I have yet to figure out why Lily was ever attracted to me."

00:46 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Accord Missions in 15 minutes. Please try to be at Old Earth Lounge at midnight."

00:47 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Eh, Ather's not handsome. It was his personality that drew me to him."

00:47 "There are so many other pilots that are better than me. Yet she chose me." You laugh.

00:47 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Shh, don't say anything about that though."

00:48 You say, "Oh, I'm not going to say anything to anyone."

00:48 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Well Hmm Noah, what drew me to Noah."

00:49 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I mean we were best friends for the longest of times."

00:49 You say, "That's always a good thing."

00:49 You say, "Hey, I hate to cut this short, but I really should get going. It was really nice to talk to you and hope things start looking up for you."

00:50 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He was outgoing, and not shy like me, but he was quiet too, I don't know howt to explain it. He was very protective over me, and man could he sing."

00:50 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

00:50 You chuckle.

00:50 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "He had a soft velvet voice."

00:50 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Oh and sure."

00:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:01 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:04 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 247" has jumped out of the sector.

01:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:04 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Debate.

01:04 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:05 You pull a large lever towards you.
