01:39:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

01:39:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:39:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "We'll go pickup your flare though if it's ok in case BAS is invaded?"

01:39:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:39:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:39:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:39:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:40:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:40:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:40:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:40:34 You say, "Thanks. Iapreciate that."

01:40:37 You grin.

01:40:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I probably shouldn't fly around in it as much as I do considering I don't know when I could replace it."

01:41:13 You say, "Apparently, we can still buy tactical platforms."

01:41:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I would stip down my other platform but still there's so much I can't replace currently."

01:41:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:41:17 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:41:21 You say, "But we can't get all of the upgrades."

02:08:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:08:31 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We're not planning to keep a BAS up. Just put it up so folks would have one."

02:08:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:08:39 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

02:08:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:08:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

02:09:19 The starship transitions into another sector.

02:09:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:37:32 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:37:32 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, a letter, a soft blush pink cotton bra decorated with a tiny ribbon rosette in the center, and a short-sleeved aqua sailor top with a soft white bow here.

04:06:47 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:06:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:07:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:07:05 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:07:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:07:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
You're already standing.

04:07:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident joins your group.

04:07:19 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

04:07:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:07:20 You are credited with 12,750,959.97 AEU credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident has automatically contributed 1,649,808.01 AEU credits.

04:07:20 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:07:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

04:07:22 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

04:07:22 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

04:07:23 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

04:07:23 You can go up.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

04:07:24 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

04:07:25 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:07:26 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

04:07:26 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

04:07:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:07:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:07:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:07:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:07:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:07:44 The starship is already moving.

04:07:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:07:46 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

04:07:47 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

04:07:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.

04:07:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:07:53 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

04:07:58 The starship transitions into another sector.

04:18:08 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

04:18:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at EAOS Asteroid Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a soft red heather cotton polo, and a pair of white cotton briefs here.
You can go out.
