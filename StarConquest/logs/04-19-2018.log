REPLICATING AUTONOMOUS TRANSMIGRATORY SPACECRAFT

For many years, rumours of the infamous 'replicators' filtered only through the outskirts of the thinly spread unreg community.  Anyone who heard the story would merely smile and nod, while anyone who claimed to have seen a berserker drone was assumed to have Space Madness and could be safely ignored.

This is no longer the case. 

The von Neumann machines now known as 'RATS' are devices that have one purpose: to make more of themselves.  Whatever original mission they may once have had has long since been forgotten, this is now their primary (and only apparent) objective.  Their origin is likewise unknown, but evidence indicates that they have emerged from somewhere significantly Rimward of the vague, constantly shifting borders of unregistered space.  

Each class of RATS appears to have a different task designed to make this primary purpose more efficient: probes to scout an area to detect the largest concentrations of raw materials; miners to facilitate speedier acquisition of those raw materials; reapers to acquire raw material from threats.  There are also rumors of other classes, from great hulks to tiny things the size of a person.

When a region is fully harvested of usable materials probes are sent out en masse to locate new resources, and when a suitable one is detected the process begins once again.

In the event that probes do not find enough raw materials within some set amount of time, it has been recorded that larger classes of RATS will be cannibalised in order to reuse their own base materials to construct whatever classes of RATS are necessary for the most efficient propagation of the swarm.

It is theorised that the vast hulks we have termed 'assimilators' may be a stage in nest formation, as they are extremely rare and have currently only been seen briefly in regions that soon develop a high swarm presence.

Information gained from damaged cores have shown that the RATS possess a complex learning algorithm that utilises emergent behaviour to find the most efficient solution to a task.  Despite many claims to the contrary, they are in no way sentient or self-aware, but are instead idiot savants of the highest order that can reach the optimal solution to a problem in a frighteningly short space of time, resulting in new designs of RATS that are able to avoid previous problems.

While singularly they are barely a minor nuisance - a few probes easily dispatched by even the most novice of pilots - the RATS travel in swarms of millions and a single probe seen means that hundreds of thousands of miners, reapers and more are close by, unseen.  Encountering even a fraction of an active swarm is something to be avoided if at all possible.

KNOWN SWARMS:

ALPHA-15-02-05-MD - The first 'major' swarm detected, original EAOS scans indicated over one and a half billion individual RATS units, but in 2317 the swarm broke the two billion mark.  It is currently moving coreward parallel to interalliance space on a course which does not intersect with any beaconed sector.

BETA-16-09-10-TA - The second 'major' swarm detected, original EAOS scans indicated approximately one and a half billion individual RATS units. Currently being tracked as it moves on a circular path through an oort cloud with a potential risk of course corrections leading towards Mutuality space.  Due to several careful 'pruning' efforts over the past few years from Tandem Pact patrols, EAOS task forces, and Accord Peacekeepers, current scans report barely one billion individual units.

GAMMA-12-05-17-SC - The third 'major' swarm detected, comprised of approximately three billion individual units. It is currently heading away from inhabited space towards the Kiron Nebula, located antispinward and 'down' of inhabited space.

There are at least a dozen 'minor' swarms monitored by the Tandem Pact, EAOS, and Accord of Free Worlds.  Minor swarms comprise of less than one billion individual RATS units, with varied courses.  Several minor swarms have been eradicated by a combined effort of careful 'pruning' while others have been cannibalised by larger swarms as they intersect.  Smaller swarms often merge to form larger swarms, which may lead to the creation of further m

01:31 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

You have a total of seven battlesuit slots.

01:33 The ship is already moving.

01:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:33 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

01:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:33 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 423" has jumped out of the sector.

01:34 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:34 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.
The computer reports that the one-person fighter "KO Peashooter" has jumped into the sector.

01:34 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A tank suit, an EAOS suit, or a rat suit."

01:34 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, KO Peashooter! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:34 I don't understand that.

01:34 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:34 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:34 You can't go that way.

01:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the pay isn't amazing on those. How many points do they give?"

01:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I recall it being 1 or 2, which isn't too bad if you do all 8. You also get points from all the drone kills."

01:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're not the best, but if you're trying to raise ground quickly you might as well do them."

02:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where are you looking?"

02:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Two sectors east of spinword. I am heading out another sector east and let's see what I find."

02:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I would stick to beaconed sectors."

02:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a

You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:31 You exit the ship.

02:31 [The Torus; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.

02:31 You can't go that way.

02:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you go out into uncharted space you might find nests and rats defending them, but they're more likely to be heavy fighters and reapers."

02:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:31 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And those probably aren't worth the trouble for you."

02:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:32 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:32 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

02:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:32 The ship is already moving.

02:32 The ship is already moving.

02:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Spinward Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Wait. So when I blew up those minors, I could have gotten more for them?"

02:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Spinward Cluster."

02:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:32 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 423" has jumped out of the sector.

02:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:32 Streams of stellar gases and glittering clusters of debris unfurl in every direction in nearby space.

02:32 Via general sector communication, Beacon A-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Spinward Cluster."

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "What do you mean, "Wont serve me well?" I am confused now."

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think they'll be generally too tough to be worth your time to fight without some ship upgrades."

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could be wrong, though."

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Well, I some how blew three of them up earlier."

02:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Rats heavy fighters and rats reapers, that is."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, well, if you can take them easily enough then carry on."

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Are you kidding? That was crazy difficult!"

02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski laughs.

02:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon C-12. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:36 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Heavy fighters aren't really the worst, I would just use torpedos and be careful."

02:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:36 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:36 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

02:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:36 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:36 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're probably looking at 2-3 torpedos per rat."

02:36 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:37 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "How can I tell how many torpedos are left in my ship?"

02:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure, but you can definitely walk down into your cargo hold and look in the ammo bin."

02:38 I don't understand that.

02:38 You scramble to your feet.

02:38 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

04:42 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Oh okay."

05:23 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

05:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

05:23 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Airlock]

14:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

14:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

16:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily giggles and 'I can relate to that!

16:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I saw Melinda and asked if it was ok to bring the fish tanks. She said yes which I htought would be ok but I wanted to confirm that first. Obviously, no pets and spiders."

16:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah ok. Cool."

16:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at Fringe Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Estuary". The organization has earned 249,183.03 credits.

17:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

17:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

17:20 You can go out and enter into the ship.

Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to battlesuit storage aboard this ship.

17:20 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.

17:20 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:20 The ship is already moving.

17:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

17:21 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:21 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:21 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:21 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:21 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Fearless! Welcome to home space!"

17:21 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

17:21 --
AutoStar (general-purpose starship autopilot) Version 9.1

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:21 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

17:21 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:21 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:22 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:22 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

17:22 You exit the ship.

17:25 Wait 3 seconds.

17:25 Your drop pod hits with a thud, and the two halves fall away.

17:25 [Hyperion; Drop Zone] (inside a battlesuit)
A large drop-pod shaped crater decorates this urban cul-de-sac, which buckles the pavement up in all directions near it. High-rise tenements and office buildings line the road in every way except for one, and their dusting of soot seems to almost fall off the building in a gentle black rain onto the sidewalk.

17:55 I don't understand that.

17:55 A man in a silver flightsuit ushers you into your battlesuit. Moments later, you're in a darkened drop pod, and you can only sense the movement of being loaded into the deployment shuttle and launched toward the mission site.

17:55 (20 seconds roundtime.)

17:55 Wait 20 seconds.

17:55 Your drop pod hits with a thud, and the two halves fall away.

17:55 [Hyperion; Drop Zone] (inside a battlesuit)
A large drop-pod shaped crater decorates this urban cul-de-sac, which buckles the pavement up in all directions near it. High-rise tenements and office buildings line the road in every way except for one, and their dusting of soot seems to almost fall off the building in a gentle black rain onto the sidewalk. Your patrol sensor reports this area as having already been patrolled.

(4 seconds roundtime.)

17:59 Two young adults talking quietly glance your way, then separate and move off in different directions.

17:59 You and your battlesuit are promptly picked up by a deployment shuttle, which begins returning to the deployment facility.

17:59 (20 seconds roundtime.)

17:59 [New Earth; Spaceport Security; Peacekeeper Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

17:59 This spartan back area is full of hastily assembled cabling and support structures to deliver battlesuits to a waiting dropship.
You can go out.

17:59 Probably not a good idea to be wandering around here while wearing a few hundred extra pounds of armor and weapons.

17:59 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

17:59 [New Earth; Spaceport Security; Peacekeeper Deployment]
You see a Testudinidae Monk here.
You can go out.

17:59 [New Earth; Spaceport Security]

17:59 You see a naval officer with a freshly-pressed uniform and a sanitation drone here.
You can go southwest.

17:59 I don't understand that.

17:59 [New Earth; Spaceport Security]

17:59 Spaceport security officers stand around in this large, well-equipped security station, talking quietly and keeping an eye on banks of monitors mounted to the walls. The holding cells at the back of the station are empty.
You see a naval officer with a freshly-pressed uniform and a sanitation drone here.
You can go southwest.

17:59 A naval officer with a freshly-pressed uniform says, "Good work out there. Here's 5,000,000.00 credits."

17:59 A naval officer with a freshly-pressed uniform gives 5,000,000.00 AEU credits to you.
750,000.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

18:00 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into the Peacekeeper deployment area.

18:00 You can't go that way.

18:00 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to battlesuit storage aboard this ship.

18:00 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

18:00 You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.

18:01 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

18:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

18:02 A technician gestures at you, and people are suddenly racing around, preparing a deployment shuttle for flight.

18:02 A man in a silver flightsuit ushers you into your battlesuit. Moments later, you're in a darkened drop pod, and you can only sense the movement of being loaded into the deployment shuttle and launched toward the mission site.
(20 seconds roundtime.)

18:03 Your drop pod hits with a thud, and the two halves fall away.

18:03 [Hyperion; Drop Zone] (inside a battlesuit)
A large drop-pod shaped crater decorates this urban cul-de-sac, which buckles the pavement up in all directions near it. High-rise tenements and office buildings line the road in every way except for one, and their dusting of soot seems to almost fall off the building in a gentle black rain onto the sidewalk.
You can go south.

18:03       A rowdy protester crumples from the stunning and is quickly dragged away by one of their companions.

18:03 With a soft click, your battlesuit's auto-repair systems shut down with all damage repaired.

18:03 You raise a bulky set of electronic binoculars and scan the area.

18:56 --
Hello friends,

If you are receiving this letter, you have been selected by Melinda, Pierre, and Damien to come on the first contact mission that the EAOS has spoke of in the headlines. This date is not set in stone, but the tentative departure date should be around April 22nd. While we want everyone to relax and have a nice trip on the way out, this is not a pleasure trip. It's not a trip in which we wish to have half the crew or hiding out in quarters or sleeping on sofas till we get back home. While we hope things go smoothly, we don't know what to expect so need to be ready for the unexpected. Also note that we will have a ship available if anyone should need a pod ride home.

I would like confirmation letters by April 19th. If we don't get a confirmation, other arrangements may be made and your seat given to someone else	. One, two,  or all three mission managers will be waiting for people to have a discussion at 21:00 on April 19 and again just after midnight on April 20. We will meet you at the Torus on dock Alpha. We hope to see you there but understand if you cannot make the meeting and/or the trip.

We hope to have more exact departure information at this gathering. We also hope to be able to answer questions that you might have. Finally, we hope to have battlesuit assignments sorted. Therefore, if I have not spoken to you about battlesuits, please list a couple of suits that you can work well with in your co
18:56 nfirmation letter. Also, if you could care less about having to use a battlesuit, let us know.

Melinda

19:22 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:40 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)
