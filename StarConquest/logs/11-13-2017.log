Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:31 [Deep Space]

02:31 The vacuum of space seems oddly peaceful now that it surrounds you. It is not deep black as you expected, but seems to be filled with a diffuse glow. Stars glint all around you, stunningly bright and sharp with no atmosphere or vacuum-protected glass to distort their light. A wide smear of stars fills one area of the sky, pointing the way Coreward.

02:34 Board what?

02:34 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

02:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

03:41 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:41 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:41 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:41 The starship has left a unique area of space.

03:41 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

03:41 Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

23:30 [MTTS] atherj: So hosts, since we have temp station modules for just about everything, have you guys thought of adding a QE one, out of curiosity?

23:31 [MTTS] usfolks: I've wondered that too, but figured the price would end up being quite prohibitive.

23:31 [MTTS] Butchulla: I'd imagine it would be, but it's a neat idea.

23:31 [MTTS] atherj: I mean, I suppose it depends on your goals.

23:32 [MTTS] usfolks: If they were to base the module off the price for a ship-installed one, it would be what, 200 megacredits?

23:32 [MTTS] Ulias: A set of asteroid mining ones might be kinda neat too, though I'm not sure how much it would actually get used. But it could be a set of them like the salvage op ones.

23:32 [MTTS] atherj: Oh, I wouldn't necessarily base it off of all that. Most of them aren't relaly based on that kind of pricing.

23:32 [MTTS] Ulias: A QE one would be pretty nice though for sure.

23:33 [MTTS] atherj: I would probably say something more along the lines of 24-25 megacredits.

23:33 [MTTS] Butchulla: I don't even wanna think about a module that would cost 200 megacredits.

23:33 [MTTS] atherj: For something like what is currently occurring with the in-character expedition that people are on now, a QE module would've been an interesting add-on.

23:33 [MTTS] usfolks: However, those chars do have easy access to a QE as it is.

23:33 [MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah, it would have.

23:36 [Deep Space]

23:36 You see an unlikely bladed weapon made for a non-human hand here.
You can go in any direction using a spacejet.
You are weightless here.
(12 seconds roundtime.)

23:36 [MTTS] Ulias: Would be kinda neat if it worked like the message board thing too. So that no matter what station you are on in the sector, you can see the who list like when on a ship with a QE.

23:36 [MTTS] atherj: Yep.

23:36 I don't understand that.

23:36 You pick up an unlikely bladed weapon made for a non-human hand.

23:36 You put an unlikely bladed weapon made for a non-human hand into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

23:36 [Outside Celestial Explorer]

23:36 You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to Celestial Explorer.
You are weightless here.
(16 seconds roundtime.)

23:36 Wait 14 seconds.

23:37 [MTTS] usfolks: I don't know...My feeling (oocly) is that we go out of comms with the intent of going out of comms. Why would we need to see the who list?

23:37 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

23:37 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

23:37 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

23:37 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

23:37 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

23:37 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

23:37 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

23:37 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

23:37 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

23:37 You turn on the silent running feature.

23:37 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

23:37 [MTTS] Ulias: Folks seem to use that who list feature on the ships with a QE quite often. Not for anything terribly important, of course. It does get used though.

23:38 [MTTS] usfolks: I mean, if you the player want to know that bad, you could always use the website.

23:38 [MTTS] atherj: Yeah, I'd say anyone who claims they don't type "who" at least 5 times when they're on an expedition is probably lying.

23:38 [MTTS] Ulias: That doesn't show you the folks that are out of comms though, only the ones that are in comms.

23:39 [MTTS] atherj: Well, it does show the out of comms ones too, as long as they're on a QE-equipped ship.

23:39 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

23:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:39 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Airlock]

23:39 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.

23:39 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

23:39 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

23:39 [MTTS] usfolks: Well, it's certainly nice to be nosy and know where people are, but if you want to use a QE for that, then maybe ask that more ships be allowed to fit a QE too?

23:39 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

23:39 [MTTS] Ulias: Right, was just saying you can't use that to replace the QE thing.

23:39 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

23:39 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

23:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:39 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

23:39 [Enter `yes' or `no']

(14 seconds roundtime.)

23:39 [MTTS] Ulias: I know the info is displayed in other ways, but I bet the game looks kinda empty to folks. Like new players coming in, when we are all out of comms like this.

23:40 [MTTS] usfolks: They see a line that says there are others connected but out of comms range.

23:40 You pick up a plate carved with a geometric design.

23:40 You put a plate carved with a geometric design into a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

23:40 [Outside Celestial Explorer]

23:40 You can go in any direction using a spacejet, or return to Celestial Explorer.

You can go south and out.
[MTTS] usfolks: Also, the QE on a station module wouldn't display the people on their own ships light-days out.

23:41 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

23:41 You turn on the silent running feature.

23:41 [MTTS] Grunze: Why not just extend the comms bubble out to 1500 lightyears since people can't seem to go out of comms.

23:41 [MTTS] usfolks: Ouch.

23:41 [MTTS] atherj: Not necessarily, at least when they see people with the percent signs, at least they're seeing that there are actually people on the game, even if they're not actually somewhere where they can talk. If there's just a line saying there are people out of communications range, or active but with comms off and only shows like 5 names total, then that will spark a whole new line of things.

23:41 [MTTS] usfolks: Thanks Grunze. Basically what I was trying to get at in a slightly different way earlier.

23:42 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, if youa re a new player you might not know what that line means about folks being out of comms at first.

23:42 [MTTS] usfolks: They see that with the line there though. " Your communicator also reports that there are 11 pilots who were active but dropped out of communications."

23:42 [MTTS] usfolks: And that's why you ask questions as a new player.

23:43 [MTTS] atherj: And as a completely new player, who wouldn't have friends to ask questions to OOCl on Roleplaying Eradication Software or their preferred form of messengery, do you relaly think a lot of them would know what that would mean if they were completely fresh to the mud?

23:43 [MTTS] usfolks: I didn't have anyone to ask oocly. I asked on Newbie I believe and it was explained to me.

23:43 [MTTS] atherj: I say better to keep the names in when possible.

23:44 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

23:44 [MTTS] usfolks: Well, that's why I said maybe advocate for a QE being able to be installed on a wider variety of ships.

23:44 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

23:44 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

23:44 [MTTS] Butchulla: I think seeing the names did make it easier for me when I started out. At least seeing people there even though they can't rp with you, is better than just seeing a whole chunk of people out of range.

23:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:44 [MTTS] nadira: I certainly would not have known what out of comms range was during the first days of my gameplay. I do think that function on the qe exists to make the game seem less empty of players, but only the hosts can give us a definite answer on that.

23:45 [MTTS] atherj: Pretty much, yeah. At least you won't see a who list with only like 4 names on it.

23:45 [MTTS] Ulias: I do like that there's times when you are just gone from the list, I wouldn't want that to be completely removed.

23:45 [MTTS] atherj: You can turn off your communicator for that! Even on a QE-equipped ship.

23:45 [MTTS] atherj: (I think that works on a QE-equipped ship) not sure.

23:45 [MTTS] Ulias: It does.

23:45 [MTTS] usfolks: Actually, if you turn your comm off on a QE-equipped ship, you still show up on the who list back home, just not to the poeple on the ship.

23:46 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh really? Hmm, learn somethign new all the time.

23:46 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. I tested it out recently. I was surprised too.

23:46 [MTTS] atherj: That sounds potentially buggy and worth a support ticket.

23:46 [MTTS] nadira: If you only see yourself on the game, which does happen at times, th efact that it somewhere says there might be 10 other players somewhere, might not really make you realize you could ask them over the newbie channel.

23:46 [MTTS] Butchulla: Agreed, Ulias. But in general, I like seeing the names. I think from an OOCly perspective, it's good for people to see names, rather than just a bunch of inactive people. It makes you want to stick around and play, rather than just logging off because you're the only one around.

23:47 [MTTS] usfolks: I've been home with no one out of comms, myself dozing, only one new player around, and saw them ask something. I came out of dozing to answer. So that's not exactly accurate.

23:47 I don't understand that.

23:47 I don't understand that.

23:47 You may not leave the airlock until its environment matches that of the ship.

23:47 Are you sure you wish to leave the ship for a spacewalk?

23:48 Wait 9 seconds.

23:48 [MTTS] usfolks: Also, you're talking about totally restructuring how the QE works, what ships it goes on, and also they'd have to probably lower the point requirement. If that's what you want, ask for it. I actually do wish we could put it on some ships that we can't, that we often use for out of comms things like mod transports and carriers.

23:48 [MTTS] atherj: Not accurate 100% of the time but still accurate a higher percentage than inaccurate!

23:49 [MTTS] atherj: Well, that's why I compromised (see original suggestion).

23:49 [Outside Celestial Explorer]

23:49 You float above the starship's brightly-shining hull, which at this distance blocks off a large portion of your view of space.  The glint of stars reflects from the hull.  The reflection is occasionally distorted by various weapons scars or pockmarks.
