Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a
robotic chef named Nellie, a sheet of white paper, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of tan suede clogs. She is also
wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset
with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver
bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon
purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a

* Deeper Exploration Missions Authorized into the Experimental Research
Structure's Massive Bari Infestation, aka 'The Megapod' [18 December 2317] (ESR)

Star Conquest Help: Megapod Raids
--
Category: Activities
--
The 'megapod' is a massive Bari infestation (see the Bari help file) of the EAOS
Experimental Research Structure, which was abandoned during the Outsider War. An
IFS attack several years later catastrophically breached the structure, allowing
the Bari access to space. Given the EAOS's penchant for tinkering and genetic
engineering, the full extent of the infestation and the nature of the creatures
inhabiting the megapod is unknown.
However, you and your fellow civilian pilots can help to uncover the mysteries
of the megapod. Through a series of scouting missions, assaults, and raids, you
can penetrate ever deeper into the megapod and, with a little luck, even recover
some pre-War EAOS technology. To participate, deploy an aerial fortress to the
Experimental Research Structure.
Here are the available megapod missions, ordered by difficulty. Missions are not
all linear, and sometimes your party will have a choice of where to go. Greater
danger often brings greater rewards! One megapod mission may be completed per
Conquest period.
SCOUT THE MEGAPOD
A scouting mission ventures just a short distance into one of the megapod's many
exterior entrances. By exploring these top level tunnels, you can find ways to
move deeper into the megapod.
Recommended Party Size: 5
SHALLOW ASSAULT
Move beyond the entry area of the megapod and see what is brewing just below the
surface.
Requirements: Five scouting missions completed by every would-be participant.
Recommended Party Size: 5
More missions will come in the future!

This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However,
we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make
sure everyone gets a gift!
First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within
the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and
celebration a little closer to the holiday!
Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes
for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that
already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action
figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos, custom hair styles, small "plastic
surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest
selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details
for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much,
please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to
add additional lines of text!
Thank you!

William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.
