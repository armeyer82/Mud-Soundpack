Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-bindin
00:06:11 g resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

00:25:32 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

00:53:16 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"

00:53:23 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "beep beep"

00:53:25 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:53:26 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:53:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:53:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:56:08 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

00:56:09 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a greater minimodule of projectile boost, and an EAOS Conjurer here.
You can go up and out.

00:56:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So what level is your aEU Constantine?"

00:57:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "2."

00:57:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok well then we'll take Tara's EAOS and Shule's EAOS it will just take us awhile but it's ok."

00:59:29 Your communicator reports that...

00:59:29 
At least two recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

00:59:32  You are wearing a short-sleeved navy and white madras plaid cotton shirt, a pair of slim blue stone linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:59:32 You are carrying a secondary pilot command access unit in your right hand.

00:59:41 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

00:59:43 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]

00:59:43 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:59:43 You exit the ship.

00:59:43 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

00:59:48 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

00:59:51 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

00:59:52 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
You can go out.

01:00:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just arrived.

01:00:07 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:00:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

01:00:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

01:00:16 You smile.

01:04:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a hot cup of espresso.

01:04:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I was thinking about our void piercer discussion."

01:05:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I noticed that Ather's book lists a 10% speed boost on both the void piercer and the gemini."

01:05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But not on the scout."

01:05:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Lily, your scout speed you read off to us was the same as Eli's gemini speed."

01:05:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:05:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Because the Scout is an aEU design whereas the others are not."

01:06:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

01:06:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:06:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "My gemini is slower."

01:06:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:06:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also remember the Gem is not an Exploration ship. It does not have exploration sensors."

01:06:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So do you think it's the case then that the void piercer offers an AEU pilot no benefit, since the scout is just as fast?"

01:06:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The speed is really the only thing I was getting at."

01:06:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was wondering why I would ever want to own a void piercer if it's no faster than the scout."

01:07:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The void piercer isn't unique to the AEU, is it?"

01:07:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well it's a matter of personal preference versus your own economy. If you want a Void Piercer, nobody is sstopping you."

01:07:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well yeah, I understand that. I was just trying to figure out if there was any reason for me to buy one."

01:07:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:07:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope the Void Piercer is available to anyone."

01:07:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not going to buy one because it looks pretty."

01:07:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:07:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:07:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it sounds like the AEU scout makes the void piercer useless to us."

01:08:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I can just forget about it, I guess."

01:08:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:08:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, as I said, I owned one for nearly two years and decided to get tid of it."

01:08:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:08:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Rid of it."

01:08:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I bought the flare because it looks pretty."

01:08:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:08:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Whoah it sure is!"

01:08:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm slightly disappointed because I was looking forward to getting a new toy to play with tomorrow."

01:08:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess if I don't need it, I don't need it."

01:09:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I certainly don't need a toy with no guns that isn't faster than my scout."

01:09:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I bought a gemini and tug today."

01:09:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

01:09:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess it does have more charge."

01:09:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:09:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey it's your money though. I don't really artifact locally anymore because I only earn just credits from them now so I personally don't need a Void Piercer and I rarely use my Exploraiton Scout either."

01:09:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll have to think about if that's worth it to me."

01:10:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, pointless if it isn't faster. That's the whole reason I wanted one."

01:10:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:10:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nobody said it isn't faster but not enough to make me keep one around."

01:10:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:10:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:10:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:10:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather's book leads me to believe it won't be faster."

01:10:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I've been saying."

01:11:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It lists both the void piercer and the gem as 110% speed ships."

01:11:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And doesn't list any such bonus on the scout."

01:11:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:11:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh well it is but not significantly faster than our own."

01:11:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if your scout and Eli's gem move at the same speed, then I think I can't expect the void piercer to be any faster."

01:11:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless the book's information is incomplete in some way."

01:11:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I can just buy one and look."

01:11:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Our scout is actually faster thn the gem."

01:12:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will have to read his book as there may be an error."

01:12:12 You say, "Yeah, maybe."

01:12:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He may have put the speed of the Advanced scout in there and not the Exploration Scout."

01:12:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or if you're really worried about speed, you could get a double speed plant for the scout and you'd be fine."

01:12:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:12:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup."

01:13:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, if the void piercer isn't any faster, that's what I'll do."

01:13:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:13:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or a speed and sensor plant."

01:13:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

01:13:36 You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.

01:13:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:13:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

01:13:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When I went to the remains of the Telexan 134th, I estimated that my sensors were reaching out to about 6 light years."

01:13:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:14:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "In what ship?"

01:14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I wasn't sure if all locations could be detected at the same distance."

01:14:12 [Tactical Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I can join if you still need somebody. Would rather take RATS though. Should accomplish the same thing!"

01:14:13 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:14:18 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

01:14:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or if, for example, home beacons can be detected from farther out than debris fields."

01:14:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just an exploration scout."

01:14:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:14:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure thing Rats is fine."

01:14:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:14:42 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure Nissi, sure thing Rats is fine."

01:15:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow what an honor."

01:15:09 You smile.

01:15:13 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

01:15:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I guess she was responding to me?"

01:15:20 [Tactical Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Okay. What tier?"

01:15:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:15:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Whatever youwant. I'm leading in a Paladin."

01:15:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:15:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Darn it."

01:15:47 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person phantazein "Tetzahuitl".

01:15:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:15:52 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Whatever you want. I'm leading in a Paladin."

01:16:13 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:16:18 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

01:16:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's just I know that Tara is going to run low on energy pretty fast."

01:16:47 You say, "Yeah, she will."

01:19:13 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:19:18 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

01:19:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Boy that drone is sure eager."

01:29:39 Constantine Stone says, "I always forget I'm wearing that thing."

01:29:39 Nissi Valdaire says, "As long as you're not too close to the river."

01:29:41 Constantine Stone says, "It's like a second skin."

01:29:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "Then you might want it."

01:33:13 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:33:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:33:15 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

01:33:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn, I don't get 3 points for bubble artifacts anymore."

01:33:16 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the north.

01:33:21 Nissi Valdaire presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a RATS Nanite Soldier from storage and sets it in front of her.

01:33:21 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

01:33:23 Nissi Valdaire presses a button on a RATS Nanite Soldier, which splits open down the front. She carefully climbs inside.

01:34:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the north followed by Tara Flores.

01:34:38 Constantine Stone stands up.

01:34:39 Constantine Stone presses a button on an AEU Combat Auxiliary, which splits open down the front. He carefully climbs inside.

01:34:40 This would be a bad place to try that.

01:34:41 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Daisy May."

01:34:46 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

01:35:06 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

01:35:10 You can't do that right now.

01:35:26 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

01:35:28 You can't do that right now.

01:35:30 You can't do that right now.

01:35:31 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

01:35:33 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

01:35:39 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Constantine Stone (AEU Combat Auxiliary). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

01:35:42 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

01:35:42 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:36:02 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

01:36:02 (20 seconds roundtime.)

01:36:22 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

01:36:22 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You see Constantine Stone (AEU Combat Auxiliary) here.
You can go east.

01:36:31 You peer east...

01:36:31 
[Ventilation Tunnels; T-Junction] (inside a battlesuit)

You see Bari Mold Alpha here.

01:36:32 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Tara Flores (EAOS Plasma Wielder).

01:36:44 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Nissi Valdaire (RATS Nanite Soldier).

01:36:46 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (League Paladin).

01:36:55 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Not it!"

01:37:09 You say to Tara Flores, "Sounds like you volunteered."

01:37:11 Tara Flores giggles.

01:37:15 Tara says to you, "Nope!"

01:37:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok mold and moving."

01:37:16 Nissi Valdaire says, "Nothing a plasma bath won't take care of."

01:37:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

01:37:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Moving."

01:37:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident moves east.

01:50:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope probably on The torus bue was asking you if you wanted to fly Pulsar Beacons but if it's just us three."

01:50:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I thought Tara was up for beacons too?"

01:51:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

01:51:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well that is why I suggested Pulsar?"

01:51:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure."

01:51:19 You scramble to your feet.

01:51:19 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:51:20 You exit the ship.

01:51:20 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

01:51:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Need to just get one more?"

01:51:27 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

01:51:27 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

01:51:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Clipper is three person, isnt it?"

01:51:43 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:51:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:51:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:51:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:51:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:51:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ooh, pulsar."

01:51:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It is, but now we have 4 people."

01:52:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but I meant if we're using a ship of mine we need 3, since I have no two person ship."

01:52:04 The computer reports that the scout "Polutropos" has jumped into the sector.

01:52:07 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Polutropos! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:52:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it looks like we can use Shule's Pulsar."

01:52:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:52:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:52:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:52:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or our Org Pulsar."

01:52:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:52:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:52:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:52:28 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:53:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:53:05 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:53:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Critical Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:53:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:53:12 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "1 for pulsar Beacons?"

01:53:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:59:27 
[The Torus; Dock Beta]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere.

02:01:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:02:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Ocean Of Diamonds, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:02:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:02:03 Tara Flores's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I've got weapons room one."

02:02:09 The starship is already moving.

02:02:11 The starship is already moving.

02:02:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:02:12 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

02:02:15 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:59:46 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:59:47 [Starship "Star Of Destiny"; Control Room]

02:59:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

This is a very nice new AEU combat vessel. It has six laser turrets in each room (the control room and the weapon room) and a nice, 35% laser bonus. However, you will have to fill out an application if you ever want to own one, then wait to see whether or not you will get approved to own it. Approval or denial notifications can take from a few days up to a couple weeks. You will be notified by mail either way.

03:06:25 The spaceport has loaded the two-person combat scout "Bonzai Trout" into this ship.

03:06:32 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:06:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

03:06:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh shoot."

03:07:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Will try to put dampener on but I don't think I can."

03:07:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:07:04 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:07:04 You close a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

03:07:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:07:10 You put a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" in a leather briefcase.

03:07:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Star Of Destiny, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:07:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:07:21 You say, "You should be able to. I did for the cruiser."

03:07:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:07:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:07:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Aenea Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:07:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

03:07:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:07:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:07:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:07:33 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:15:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:15:27 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: =CkUT_Q^y*Um@2Q?.iqJ3}k~PhF8KtTT_&(Us<!q
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:15:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:15:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:15:38 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:15:38 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

04:20:48 An incubation sack on a bari hive bursts open, and several larval bari fall from it.

04:20:52 You put down a big red soldier felo.

04:20:53 You put down a large red soldier felo.

04:20:58 [Starship "Bari Smasher!"; Control Room]

04:20:59 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a sheet of white paper, a bari hive, a small horde of larval bari, a big red soldier felo, and a large red soldier felo here.

06:26:44 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "So maybe there's something at 287."

06:27:15 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Could be. I can run out in a capsule to check and take felo out there if there is somethin. Would be quicker than takin a bigger ship out."

06:27:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "One more shot would have taken her out."

06:27:49 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It might be worth taking a look."

06:28:10 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Any idea where he was when he discovered 'em and if it was just the regular early infestation?"

06:28:38 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "When he told us on tactical, he was west of orion. He said he wasn't sure how long he'd had them."

06:30:20 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nothing in 286. I'll go grab the capsule and head out to 287."

11:18:26 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "We need to fix that today."

11:18:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:18:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:18:32 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

11:18:33 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Hopefully we can."

11:18:36 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That would be nice, yeah."

11:18:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

11:18:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:18:44 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "How did that one go yesterday?"

11:18:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:18:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:18:53 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:18:54 You scramble to your feet.

11:18:54 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

11:18:54 You exit the ship.

11:18:56 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "How you'd expect."

11:18:59 [Revo Developmental Technologies; Main Lobby]

11:18:59 This lobby has a clear view of the night sky through a series of skylights. Starlight bounces off of the floor tiles and makes a series of dazzling patterns on the walls. Armed security guards block most of the ways deeper into the building.
You can go north, southeast, and west.

11:19:01 You can't go that way.

11:19:03 You can't go that way.

11:19:38 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

11:19:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nope."

11:19:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:19:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:19:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:19:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

11:19:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:19:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "An% with[Alexander not havin sonics.\."

11:19:53 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yeah it doe.n't get ]igh-end^minidr|n(=stuf'."

11:19:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Enter your selection:

11:20:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:20:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:20:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

11:20:19 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You two have suddenly become more intelligible."

11:20:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:20:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:20:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My old Rental 2 would have been better."

11:20:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:20:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

11:20:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:20:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:20:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:20:28 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

11:20:30 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

11:20:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:20:43 [General Communication] Ted Warburton chortles.

11:20:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:20:54 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

11:20:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

11:20:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

11:21:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

11:21:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:21:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:21:14 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

11:21:43 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

11:22:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "When I can be bothered to get out of my hot tub, I might go and pick up the 1.2 GCP I need for my next hundred, see if that gets me anything helpful."

11:25:29 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

11:25:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

11:27:38 You are carrying nothing.

11:42:15 I see no "flare" here.

11:42:19 the two-person flare "Deadly Strike"

11:42:19 You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

11:42:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No thanks."

11:42:39 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'll pass."

11:43:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And Nicolette, don't you dare make that shirt."

Arachnopals no longer transcend time and space, and now cannot move in directions beyond our comprehension.
   Posted 3 days, 19 hours, 46 minutes, and 53 seconds ago
-----
At long last, the STANDINGS command now gives far greater detail than a simple like or dislike! 

Please look forward to new additions to this system in the future.

Battlesuit energy may now be checked through roundtime.
   Posted 1 day, 13 hours, 34 minutes, and 34 seconds ago
-----
Ships that are unable to salvage (fighters, certain transports, etc) can no longer deploy atmospheric scoops. This was a bit of an oversight, and we deeply apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.

Atmospheric scoops on ships that can no longer do so, of course, be transferred off.
   Posted 1 day, 5 hours, 5 minutes, and 17 seconds ago

16:19:53 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

16:20:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gently caresses your neck and shoulders.

16:22:27 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

16:22:55 You say to Lily, "Well, if you're up to it, we could do the last two of our beacons today."

16:27:29 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior pulsates gently.

16:35:22 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

16:39:29 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

16:43:33 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

17:24:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No problem."

17:25:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:25:09 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

17:25:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

17:25:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:25:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:25:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:25:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.

Subject: Artifact Alpha 777 - Building Plan
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 16:51 20 August 2317 GST
--
Regarding how we'll proceed to maintain Artifact Alpha 777 the following is the current plan --
1. We'll maintain a complement of the Modules which SEAS Contributes on 'SEAS Spare Parts'
2. LIBS will designate where their parts will be available.
3. It's hard to get Nicolette to be consistent concerning where she loads the Core and other Modules from her org so will probably move them to 'SEAS Spare Parts' as they do pose quite a bit of clutter aboard 'Herding Cats'.
Since Artifact Alpha is comprised of eight stations If Seas is primarily responsible for four of them, and Libs is primarily responsible for the other four, it hopefully will be less confusing if we do the following.
LIBS will maintain the accelerators, Salvage processor, and watchtower
Seas will maintain the beacons, transmitter, and charger.
Please watch the Range Office and keep notes on when these Temporary Space Stations will need to be renewed. Whenever circumstances prevent any of us from being available to deploy the stations which we are responsible for, please contact me or communicate with Evenia and/or Johann.

20:57:24 [General Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Just because one pilot from the AEU declares a strike doesn't mean the entirety of the Pilot Corps are on strike."

20:57:48 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I see. Well, I have nothing nice to say, so I should probably shut up now."

20:58:17 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That's literally what the word patriot means."

20:58:24 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It means you don't hate them enough to want to do anything about it, which is pretty much the same in this kind of case."

20:59:34 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Actions speak louder than words."

20:59:36 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ergo, supporting the nation is supporting the government. Patriotism can often also be connected to nationalism, which in this case completely doesn't help your case."

21:01:48 [General Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm aware of it. Do you all look for handouts?"

21:01:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And let's face it, mere survival doesn't cost much."

21:01:54 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But you have to stop all work except in times of potential invasion by enemy forces. Mr. Kelsey, Outsiders, IFS and things."

21:02:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd take one to make a livin if it meant helpin my alliance, sure."

21:02:34 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What Emily said."

21:02:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And what Nissi said."

21:02:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ather, I hate to say it, but I'm honestly not of the mind that any form of strike is going to damage the Union. I don't agree with what the Union is doing, but this really isn't hurting it."

21:03:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not hurting it because not everyone is participating as fully as I am."

21:03:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "The Pilot Corps is not the Union's primary form of infrastructure."

21:03:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I think we also should be more wary of the possible privitation of our corps. It could mean Best might manage to get more control over who can and can't be a pilot."

21:03:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Have I even been asleep? Or have we somehow continued the exact conversation I fell asleep listening to?"

21:03:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh boy i'm not engaging in this. I tend to agree with dakhal and sorry about that."

21:25:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok. Unfortunately, I can't respond. Say something over tactical."

21:29:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:29:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope I don't see it that way. It's common to note the ship classes."

22:06:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah. Same as Eli then. Too bad they didn't have a viable candidate."

22:07:20 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, Eli and I share a great enthusasim for exploration."

22:07:28 [General Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

22:07:45 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Perhaps those people would have had more success in storied past of AEU exploration."

22:18:30 the two-person flare "Deadly Strike"

22:18:30 You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

22:19:06 I see no "work" here.

22:31:29 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:31:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

22:35:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:35:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:35:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:35:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:36:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.
