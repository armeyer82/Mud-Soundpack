02:34:29 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:34:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:34:32 You peer out...

[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" and the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 968" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

02:34:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:34:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:34:52 The ship is already moving.

02:34:54 The ship is already moving.

12:22:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

12:22:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:22:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Kim."

12:22:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:22:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:22:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:22:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

12:22:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:22:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:22:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:22:36 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

12:23:48 [Chetumal Spaceport; Garage]

12:23:49 Starships of various sizes and shapes are parked here. The area is large, able to accommodate hundreds of starships, and the ceiling is high, interlaced with the high-pressure pipes and mechanisms of the massive hydraulic system that moves ships between the garage and the landing pad above. Though the hydraulics are noisy and echo loudly through the area when activated, you can still hear the footsteps of pilots and travelers as they make their way along the wide metal stairway leading up to the landing pad and down to lower levels of the subterranean spaceport. A well-lit stairway here provides easy access to the pilot lounge.
You can go up and down.

12:55:13 A technician gestures at you, and people are suddenly racing around, preparing a deployment shuttle for flight.

12:55:13 A man in a silver flightsuit ushers you into your battlesuit. Moments later, you're in a darkened drop pod, and you can only sense the movement of being loaded into the deployment shuttle and launched toward the mission site.

A large drop-pod shaped crater decorates this urban cul-de-sac, which buckles the pavement up in all directions near it.

15:28:47 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

15:28:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:29:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:29:09 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:29:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:29:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:29:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:29:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:29:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:30:01 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

15:37:37 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

15:40:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah Love I'd love to do beacons in a bit. Just need to hurry up my lazy!"

15:41:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "No worries."

15:42:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Org : laugh and ok thanks for being patient with me. You know it's a lazy Saturday wake-up time for me."

15:44:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Take your time."

16:28:55 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 210,117.76 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

16:29:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah there they go out there to hunt asteroids and it seems Morris deliberately left us out of the processor in 285."

16:30:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I can't prove it yet though since I haven't been out there but one would think that whatever was up had been replaced since we came to terms."

16:31:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, we'll have to go out there to check for sure."

16:32:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep but he made a very snide remark about not doind anything to support AEU on General so I'm sure that means defense as well so there he is not playing according to the rules of conduct."

16:33:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, he's being an ass as usual."

16:34:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nobody but Melinda can stop him from leaving us off of the processor out there but that was a blanket statement which implies more than that."

16:35:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah."

16:37:40 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

16:43:27 There appear to be about 13 pilots recently active.

17:14:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 210,112.83 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

17:39:40 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

18:11:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:11:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

18:11:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:11:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:11:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:12:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:12:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:12:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:12:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Drifting Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:12:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:12:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

18:12:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:12:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:12:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:12:24 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 2g"zy2WtiLF&a2O16,Aoa,0E{_RF(:M2Bw.l-}qR
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:12:25 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

18:12:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:12:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:12:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:12:30 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:12:30 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Drifting Cluster."

18:12:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:12:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:12:34 The starship is already moving.

18:12:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:54 (20 seconds roundtime.)

This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system.

21:41 Alko Delovega

21:41 He appears to be 28 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has light brown skin. His body is fairly muscular with muscled hips and attractive calves. He has rounded shoulders and a muscular chest. His face is oval and quite handsome, with an average nose and strong chin. His lips are twisted and brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, his eyes are blue and narrow. His mid-back length, straight hair is carrot orange with dark blonde highlights and hanging in a thick, fluffy mass over his shoulders. He has large pale fingernails.
 He is wearing a zebra stripe tricorn pirate hat, a soft orange and black striped long-sleeved shirt with a buttoned-down collar, a fancy gold watch with sapphire accents, a black leather belt with an oval black steel buckle, a pair of old purple low rise jeans with shredded knees, and a pair of sleek white vinyl boots with numerous silver zippers. He is also wearing a silver ring set with a polished piece of dark gray lunar basalt, a bracelet of small amber beads, a dark orange flat einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a mood ring, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, an elegant gold box chain necklace, a wrist-mounted chronometer, a stamp of a stylized leaping fox, and a personal filing computer. His face, both eyes, neck, left wrist, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

21:53 You peer out...

21:53 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

21:54 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

21:54 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

21:56 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

21:56 Alko Delovega stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

21:56 You grin.

21:56 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

21:56 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, and a sanitation drone here.
Ted Warburton, Alko Delovega, Kim Saunders, Katina Faye, Erik Goodwin, and Kert On'Marr are standing here.
You can go out.

21:56 Erik Goodwin says, "So it's really been my week."

21:56 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

21:57 Kim Saunders strides south.

21:57 Kert On'Marr ambles south.

21:57 Not ejected.

21:57 You say, "Hang on."

21:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Be just a moment sorry had a problem with something."

21:57 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "In 3."

21:57 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "In 2."

21:57 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "4."

21:57 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:57 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:57 Erik Goodwin's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's not how numbers work."

21:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, we're in the cruiser."

21:58 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There's always one."

21:58 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Awh, sorry, isn't it?"

21:58 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

21:58 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
Alko Delovega is standing here.
You can go south and out.

21:58 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Lobby]

21:58 You can go north, northeast, northwest, and down.

21:58 You peer northeast...

21:58 
[Starship "Supernova"; Weapons Room Two]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an overstuffed black chair here.
Katina Faye is sitting on an overstuffed black chair.
You can go southwest.

21:58 Kert On'Marr's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Unless you don't want a rookie here? I seem to remember being asked not to gun in 1 or 2 on a ship like this."

21:59 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Oh, she is."

21:59 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Since it's lasers all the way anyway, it really doesn't matter on an AEU cruiser which room you have, except yeah, shule wants to be near the control room just in case."

21:59 Kert On'Marr's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No it isn't, I just took it."

21:59 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'll go to 6 then."

22:00 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You're fine there."

22:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
