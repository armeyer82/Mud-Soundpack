00:47:42 The Centauri Colony remains Old Earth's only remaining major extrasolar possession. The planet does not appear to be particularly teeming with life, with the color of the land fading from brownish grasses to grey bedrock.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Centauri in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:47:45 Via general sector communication, Centauri transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to Centauri Colony Orbit!"

00:47:53 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:47:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Centauri.

00:47:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:48:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:48:08 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:48:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:48:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:48:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:48:26 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

00:48:26 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:48:27 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:48:29 Lily Kaise glides out.

00:48:31 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:50:51 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

00:51:51 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

00:54:45 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:54:47 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

00:54:52 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

00:54:57 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

00:54:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:55:05 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:55:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

00:55:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:55:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:55:23 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:55:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:55:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:55:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:55:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:55:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:55:31 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:55:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:55:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:55:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:55:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:55:36 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:55:38 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

00:56:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:56:50 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:56:51 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:56:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:56:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:57:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:57:07 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

00:57:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:57:09 Lily Kaise glides out.

00:57:10 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:57:11 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:57:52 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:02:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:02:07 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:02:17 Lily Kaise puts a small red insulated cooler in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:02:51 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo seems to be hungry.

01:02:52 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo approaches a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

01:03:52 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:05:52 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

01:06:52 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're approaching that first performance goal! Our penultimate victory is just ahead! Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be annoying, but it's not!"

01:07:52 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a shark.

01:08:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can I still buy the naval warship plating somewhere?"

01:08:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:08:39 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:08:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm maybe on Endymnian?"

01:09:12 Lily Kaise removes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:09:25 Lily Kaise begins reading in a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

01:09:52 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

01:10:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is the store on Endymion that sells all the starship parts in the spaceport?"

01:10:52 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

01:11:09 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:11:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yo yo yo, it's on capella."

01:11:28 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:11:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oops it shows that on page 20 in the upgrades book."

01:11:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I've looked around Capella a few times but the station looks abandoned."

01:11:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Did I just miss it?"

01:12:01 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:12:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "There is an old pod which is their shop that you have to go into."

01:12:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. I remember the pod."

01:12:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't find the store on Endymion either."

01:12:58 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:12:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well the pod actually has a terminal in there. The other one is via a door that you need to go into from the repair shop."

01:13:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah hah! Thanks, Lily."

01:14:23 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:14:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "No problem. Just have to look around sometimes as some shops are through another shop."

01:15:40 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:15:46 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:15:52 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

01:18:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:22:51 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

01:26:52 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

01:29:01 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:29:10 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:29:13 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:29:14 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:29:17 Not much to see out there.

01:29:17 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:29:29 Lily Kaise says, "Don't forget to turn your points off."

01:29:33 Lily Kaise grins.

01:29:35 You say, "Ok, sec."

01:29:43 You say, "Be right back."

Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go up and out.

01:31:45 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:31:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey um I think you boarded yours?"

01:31:50 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:32:00 You say, "I did, but I was checking minimods."

01:32:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm?"

01:32:16 Lily Kaise says, "Will miss my decanter and was tempted to get a crew together but we'll be ok without it."

01:32:22 You nod.

01:32:27 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok ready?"

01:32:30 You nod.

01:32:33 Lily Kaise beams.

01:32:36 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:32:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Sorry, she was talking to me."

01:32:38 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

01:32:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:32:41 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:32:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

01:32:48 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:32:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Seventh Star, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:32:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:32:57 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:32:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm wha'ts up there?"

01:33:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:33:05 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:33:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:33:08 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

01:33:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:33:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:33:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:33:16 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Seventh Star, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

01:33:18 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:33:21 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Quantum Skim Accelerator to The Cross.

01:33:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:33:42 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:33:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "We're about ready to enter the skim so won't be understood over the comm."

01:34:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh good, I can say whatever I want to and no one will understand me."

01:34:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:34:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

01:34:20 You feel the ship shudder slightly as it approaches a quantum skim accelerator.

01:34:24 The computer announces, "Initiating connection with The Cross's local quantum skim accelerator network."

01:34:27 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:34:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chortles.

01:34:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm about to burn down 8 fighter beacons."

01:34:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:34:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Can tell everybody to go to blankety blank blank!"

01:34:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:34:50 The computer announces, "Connection established. Communicating between quantum skim acceleration gates now."

01:34:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire laughs.

01:35:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You know the contest hasn't started yet?"

01:35:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know but I wanted to practice."

01:35:16 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:35:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Cool!"

01:35:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah, good idea."

01:35:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I can do extra highs if I practice a little."

01:35:19 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initializing in five seconds."

01:35:21 The computer announces, "Four."

01:35:21 The computer announces, "Three."

01:35:22 The computer announces, "Two."

01:35:24 The computer announces, "One."

01:35:25 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initialized."

01:35:26 You feel the deck underneath you shudder violently, and you stumble slightly.

01:35:27 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

01:35:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I,think+Erik does overdrives, but / don't think ('m that good["

01:35:30 The shuddering finally settles down.

01:35:32 Lily Kaise says, "He's awesome."

01:35:36 The computer announces, "Skim initialization complete."

01:35:41 You grin.

01:35:47 Lily Kaise says, "But not as awesome as you."

01:35:50 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:35:52 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:35:54 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:35:56 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:36:24 Lily Kaise removes a small red insulated cooler from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:36:30 You say, "Good, so I don't have to wrroy about you dumping me for him any time soon."

01:36:30 Lily Kaise puts down a small red insulated cooler.

01:36:37 You say, "Worry."

01:36:38 Lily Kaise says, "Breakfast items are in red cooler."

01:36:42 You grin.

01:36:44 You say, "Ok."

01:36:45 Lily Kaise grins.

01:37:10 Lily Kaise says, "I accidentally tossed out my clear container but I have enough others."

01:37:23 You say, "Good, so I don't have to worry about you dumping me for Constantine any time soon."

01:37:27 You grin.

01:37:31 Lily Kaise asks, "Are yo kidding?"

01:37:41 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:37:44 Lily Kaise exclaims, "You are the only man for me in this Universe ever!"

01:37:51 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:37:52 You beam at Lily Kaise.

01:37:54 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:38:03 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:38:13 Lily Kaise says, "I hope if he wants companionship that he will find a girl or if it's male a male."

01:38:22 You say, "Oh definitely."

01:38:25 You smile.

01:38:28 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:38:55 The computer announces, "Skim complete; starship has arrived at journey destination."

01:39:00 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:39:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Farport. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:39:01 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector W-62."

01:39:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:39:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:39:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:39:07 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:39:08 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Farport."

01:39:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:39:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:39:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:39:15 Via general sector communication, Farport Station transmits, "Seventh Star, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

01:39:21 Lily Kaise says, "I would like to cleanse frontier around midnight tomorrow though."

01:39:26 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

01:39:27 You say, "Ok."

01:39:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:39:38 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:39:38 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

01:39:41 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

01:39:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

01:39:48 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:39:50 Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

01:39:51 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 371,189.78 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

01:39:51 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:40:01 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:40:02 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:40:02 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:40:12 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

01:40:16 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:40:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "#t mi"|i&>t\to"orrow I\want to%clear Old;Frontier& Hope#you~l? b_ a{ailable C_n~tant+|e."

01:40:22 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:40:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oops."

01:40:34 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I'll state that later!"

01:40:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, ">^m,(not sure a%out mi`ni]ht& but I <ill tr#-"

01:40:51 Lily Kaise says, "I should have put up a notice and i'll get into the habbit of doing so."

01:41:24 Lily Kaise says, "Oh good time isn't bad."

01:43:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:46:09 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:48:30 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

01:50:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:50:51 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:50:56 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:51:52 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:51:54 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:51:59 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:53:46 Lily Kaise says, "The accelerators go down around 2100 tomorrow so I was a little concerned but Goss maintains these so i'm sure he will have the new ones up if we're a little past that time. I thought if we could leave about 2230, it would give us enough time to get back before Conquest end."

01:53:50 Shule runs his fingers through  your hair.

01:54:11 You say, "Ok."

01:54:13 You say, "Cool."

01:54:22 Lily Kaise asks, "Is that all right?"

01:54:27 You say, "That works."

01:54:29 You smile.

01:54:30 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Ok!"

01:54:52 Lily Kaise says, "Then we can get in some good hunting before we have to go back."

01:54:55 Lily Kaise grins.

01:54:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:57:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, th#t was embarra&si/g."

01:57:18 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:57:28 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I hope he did all right."

01:57:30 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:57:35 You say, "Yeah, me too."

01:57:37 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:58:20 Lily Kaise says, "Oh thanks for voting on the pending."

01:58:23 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:58:25 You smile.

01:58:28 You say, "No problem."

01:58:48 Lily Kaise says, "This way if a module is needed for 777 or elsewhere, Constantine can get them."

01:58:53 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

01:59:52 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:59:56 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:00:08 Lily Kaise opens a compact white refrigerator and the light inside clicks on.

02:00:14 Lily Kaise helps herself to a slice of three-meat pizza.

02:00:19 Lily Kaise dangles a slice of three-meat pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

02:00:29 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:00:35 I don't see that here.

02:03:54 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "N/st?"

02:03:58 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes."

02:04:12 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But give me 9 minute~."

02:04:33 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "No one e-se, jus~ take your time."

02:07:37 I don't understand that.

02:07:41 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:08:13 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:08:13 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

02:08:17 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

02:08:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:08:29 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

02:08:29 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 1.0.

02:08:33 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

02:08:33 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:08:43 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:08:43 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:08:44 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:08:45 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:08:50 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:08:53 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

02:08:55 I don't understand that.

02:08:58 I don't understand that.

02:09:01 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:09:04 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

02:09:05 You begin dry heaving.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.

02:09:43 The stage lights flicker briefly.

02:09:53 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

02:09:55 Lily Kaise says, "I think they were a little off when they put up this last Exploration area."

02:10:01 You nod.

02:10:04 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:10:05 A readout shows The Glyphmakers' Grave about 6.21 light-days toward Galactic Northnorthwest and Very Slightly Up.
A temporary beacon appears to be 49.59 light-days away toward Galactic East.

02:10:26 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:10:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Constantine, we were not in the best ran%e for comms. Is everything all right?"

02:10:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'm alive."

02:10:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So in a sense, yes."

02:10:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But in another, true< sense("

02:10:46 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:10:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh my what happened?"

02:10:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Did you lose a ship?"

02:10:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not everything, I did."

02:11:14 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:11:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well it happens. I won't yell at you like Kim does hehe."

02:11:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

02:11:33 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:11:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'm sorry for that as you seemed eager about that."

02:11:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But she'll just bite you instead and I'll yell at you."

02:11:46 Lily Kaise says, "Eek."

02:11:50 You chuckle.

02:11:51 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

02:11:51 The room begins spinning around you.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 0.0, 0.0.
You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

02:11:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it's okay. I guess I need a!lot more practice before I can do highs."

02:11:56 Lily Kaise says, "That's weird."

02:12:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:12:07 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:12:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:12:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Just reme]ber. Aim, move fire."

02:12:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Remember."

02:12:44 Lily Kaise says, "No I wanna fire move and aim hehe."

02:12:47 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:12:50 You laugh.

02:12:55 Lily Kaise says, "Not really. Just kidding you."

02:13:02 You say, "Nah, I just want to aim and fire. Forget moving."

02:13:05 Lily Kaise grins.

02:13:10 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah me too actually."

02:13:14 You laugh.

02:13:22 Lily Kaise says, "Good grief."

02:13:30 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

02:13:30 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.
The stage lights flicker briefly.

02:13:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "It also seemed like I was doing very little damage."

02:13:40 Lily Kaise turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the riftsail to 50%.

02:13:40 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

02:13:46 Lily Kaise says, "Eww."

02:13:53 Lily Kaise says, "I do no t like that."

02:13:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't have the strongest lasers I can buy, t[ough."

02:14:16 Lily Kaise says, "Tr org also need to use your tools and it's not easy I know."

02:14:20 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:14:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's ok. It's a learning experience."

02:14:41 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:14:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also need to use your tools and it's not easy"I know."

02:15:02 The room begins spinning around you.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 2.0.

02:15:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it did seem like most hits just destroyed my weapons and what not outright."

02:15:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

02:15:22 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

02:15:22 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 2.0.

02:15:22 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

02:15:29 Lily Kaise says, "Wow it's being difficult this time."

02:15:40 You say, "They just don't want to be robbed."

02:15:44 You say, "And plundered."

02:16:04 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Rest Station from the two-person medium transport "Words Of Wisdom". The organization has earned 692,763.29 credits.

02:16:11 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

02:16:11 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:16:17 You grin.

02:16:18 Lily Kaise says, "Woo finally."

02:16:27 Lily Kaise says, "Sorry love for my pitiful navigation."

02:16:31 Lily Kaise sighs.

02:16:34 You say, "You were fine."

02:16:35 Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.

02:16:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:16:40 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

02:17:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Constantine, at midnight, we will go c]ear Old Frontier so be there!"

02:17:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll try."

02:17:47 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:17:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok hope you can."

02:19:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yes, we need to save the bari from their drunken stuper."

02:19:15 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:19:22 You laugh.

02:19:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

02:19:33 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

02:19:42 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

02:19:46 You turn off the silent running feature.

02:19:46 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:19:47 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

02:19:48 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

02:19:49 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:19:51 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:19:53 Lily Kaise glides up.

03:01:23 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

03:01:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

03:41:56 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

03:41:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

04:07:49 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

04:07:49 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

05:03:59 (20 seconds roundtime.)

05:04:18 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

05:04:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
You can go up and out.

05:04:19 Lily Kaise (League Paladin) returns from deep space.

05:04:23 A League Paladin suddenly splits down the front and deposits Lily Kaise.

05:04:30 Lily Kaise sits down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

05:04:36 I don't understand that.

05:04:37 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

05:04:40 I don't understand that.

05:04:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:04:41 I don't understand that.

05:04:42 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

05:04:44 You tongue a control inside your battlesuit, which immediately splits down the front. You carefully climb out.

05:04:44 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, an AEU Combat Universalist, and a League Paladin here.

05:05:12 The starship transitions into another sector.

05:05:16 You turn on the silent running feature.

05:05:25 a gold wrist-mounted chronometer

05:05:26 It covers nothing.
You glance down at your watch, noting the time:
1JMA2.8N0 [0305 GST]

05:05:35 You say, "Oh, I should go to sleep soon."

05:05:41 You say, "I just saw the time."

05:05:43 You say, "Sorry."

05:05:56 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh ok then should we head back to the charging station or do we have time for one more?"

05:06:17 You say, "We should probably head back."

05:06:22 You say, "I'm sorry."

05:06:27 Lily Kaise says, "It's ok love."

05:06:31 Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

05:06:32 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

05:06:57 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

05:06:58 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Gamma 002."

05:06:58 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:07:08 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:07:08 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

05:07:18 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

05:07:48 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:07:48 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:07:51 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

05:07:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AEU Recharging Battery-Powered Rest Station.

05:08:46 Lily Kaise begins the docking sequence.

05:08:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

05:09:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:09:04 Lily Kaise closes a compact white refrigerator.

05:09:11 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

15:39:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Sad. I was hoping it'd get even more mysterious."

15:39:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:40:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:40:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:41:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

15:41:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:42:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:42:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:43:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

15:43:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:44:16 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:06:52 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 590,234.38 credits from a xenology submission.

16:15:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Excellent work on our first performance goal! Let's go for the second!"

16:21:56 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hello universe."

16:22:14 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."

16:22:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "The universe left a message, it's gone for a bang, but it'll be be contracting shortly."

16:22:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

16:26:09 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The torus doesn't seem to want to let me have two ships at the same landing pad."

16:26:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Really? That's odd."

16:26:26 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Just power them up."

16:27:54 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that worked."

16:27:56 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks."

16:28:01 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yup."

17:08:01 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 1,167,583.61 credits.

17:15:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

17:35:23 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So for lasers you've got your 3 second, 4 second, and 5 second fire time lasers."

17:35:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The 3 second lasers have the best hull hit bonuses, but do the least damage."

17:35:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's all i"ve seen."

17:35:44 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are these still viable choices?"

17:35:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 760,075.61 credits.

17:37:03 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I don't know much about lasers, but the 5 secs seems to be used only on mules. With lasers you are always worried about the grid, perhaps the 3 secs drain even more."

17:37:32 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I really don't know, ask ather when he is back?"

17:37:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The three second ones are the least grid intensive, actually. I was using them when I failed that beacon drop."

17:37:50 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "But you use them more."

17:37:56 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's true."

17:38:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's a good point."

17:38:16 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Check the damage grid ratio."

17:38:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Constantine, remember the AEU has a special bonus on AEU combat ships which other alliances do not. Also, if you have most likely 3 or more lasers per room in a combat ship, you want the Crystaline lasers but for ships like Mules, transports and the like where you have 1 or 2 lasers, you want more damage so the Heavy lasers are pretty well-suited for those."

17:38:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

17:39:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't know if it might be worth using the lasers with 10 or 8% hull bonuses on ships with 6+ turrets."

17:39:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Obviously, in combat you wat the fastest lasers with the most damage effect so yes there is a balance issue but I think you can see where i'm going with this."

17:39:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But pretty much everyone uses the crystalline optics one on combat ships?"

17:40:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes."

17:41:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "And of course the other alliances tend to use chainguns which I don't like at all as I don't care for being non-energy dependent. However, the EAOS Torpedo Launcher is pretty good and it's an ok replacement for minis unless you simply don't have enough cargo space for ammunition."

17:41:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been using torpedos exclusively, but only because I can't buy minicannons yet."

17:42:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assume torpedos are also much easier on a fighter's tiny grid."

17:42:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "That's ok but where you have an option for lasers, use the fastest ones with the most damage that you can."

17:42:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I mean I use torpedos for my launchers, I use the lasers whenever I can in combat."

17:43:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good as launchers aren't that fast as you know."

17:43:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah. I did three standard beacons before I went to bed."

17:43:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seemed like sometimes I would get a guy who was super fast."

17:43:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "That is awesome!"

17:44:00 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged and is now shutting down.

17:44:01 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:44:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't been able to buy a new asteroid station part in a long time."

17:44:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like maybe over 1000 points."

17:45:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I am hoping to get a cutting of the double-laser plant from Ather. It will be expensive but it will be there for org members. It would take awhile for the plant to mature enough to take subsequent cuttings but it will be nice to have."

17:45:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be really good."

17:46:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh yeah, those become fewer and far between as the next ones are higher drillers."

17:47:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I really didn't keep good records as to how many points were required per each level and wish I would have."

17:47:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I've been trying to record some of that stuff."

17:47:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I've been recording what the mining upgrades cost."

17:48:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And what point levels you get them at."

17:48:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "As I say I haven't kept track. I just bought them when they were available hehe."

17:49:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I guess the last ones I bought were around 17,800 industry but I don't know how accurate that is and those were likely the last part I'll see."

17:49:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow."

17:49:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much industry do you have?"

17:49:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "About 19,600."

17:49:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow, that's a lot. How long have you been a pilot?"

17:50:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I could have gotten to 20k but I just am lazy with working lately and have been for at least six months."

17:50:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise laughs.

17:50:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

17:50:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm let's see."

17:51:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Around the beginning of next month it will be 3 and a half years."

17:51:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just hit two months a couple days ago."

17:52:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah and you're doing really well!"

17:52:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope so."

17:52:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I need a little work on combat."

17:52:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'll get there."

17:52:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't expect anyone to work as I have at all. I come from a long line of over-achievers and workaholics so it's not for everyone."

17:53:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's ok for you too. You will manage quite well."

17:55:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like the simulator can't put out more then 3 drones at a time."

17:56:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Did you go to the advanced one?"

17:56:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my biggest problem on the high beacons is bumping into other ships when I try to move, and getting hit."

17:56:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

17:57:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm I thought you could put more drones than three in there but glad you found it. It's been awhile since I've been in there and I need the practice. Sure wish we could simulate them with there being warpers in there too."

17:58:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I can do it if I try again. I might wait until we have the frontier open though."

17:58:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "My insurance is getting expensive."

17:58:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Flying is something I started out really enjoying but I don't as much as I once did or I'd be cruiser qualified by now so that is my biggest weakness as a pilot."

18:00:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "We will have 1000 Command probably by sometime next month so at that point, we'll have a slot to support another Cruiser so it will be there for yours!"

18:00:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chuckles.

18:00:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:00:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "You'll get there I kow it though."

18:00:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just let me get 4907 more lock evasions."

18:00:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Know it too."

18:02:52 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,036,064.31 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

18:03:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, bad flow out to 777 right now."

18:15:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

18:51:01 Lily Kaise glides in from below.

18:51:06 Lily Kaise kisses you.

18:51:08 Lily Kaise kisses you.

18:51:20 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Come on wakey wakey!"

18:51:27 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

18:51:48 Lily Kaise says, "The day is dragging on and we need to get back sometime."

18:51:52 Lily Kaise sighs.

18:51:54 Lily Kaise glides south.

18:52:07 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

18:52:08 Lily Kaise glides down.

19:15:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"

19:53:05 You pick up a pair of gray canvas sneakers.

19:53:08 You pull a pair of gray canvas sneakers onto your feet.

19:53:10 You scramble to your feet.

19:53:10 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, an AEU Combat Universalist, a League Paladin, and a compact purple microwave oven here.

19:53:29 You kiss Lily Kaise.

19:53:31 You sit down on a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:53:36 Lily Kaise kisses you.

19:53:42 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

19:53:43 Lily Kaise says, "Wrap shule."

19:53:48 You wrap your arms around yourself.

19:53:48 Lily Kaise says, "Wrap shule."

19:53:52 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:53:54 You laugh.

19:53:58 You wrap your arms around yourself.

19:53:59 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

19:54:03 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

19:54:07 Lily Kaise asks, "Ready?"

19:54:12 You say, "Yep."

19:54:56 Lily Kaise asks, "I want to ask you since you have already notified everyone of the conquest challenge. If we don't leave before midnight, are you ok with that since we're getting such a late start?"

19:55:21 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

19:55:38 You say, "Sure, I may say something over the alliance channel again."

19:55:42 There appear to be about 10 pilots recently active.

19:56:33 Lily Kaise says, "Ok that will work. I just don't know that we might be able to come out here again prior to the end of the month but if AEU does break off with Accord, will not know for sure how this area will be affected for us. So want to enjoy what we can."

19:56:41 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

19:56:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:56:43 You nod.

19:56:47 Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.

19:56:52 Lily Kaise kisses you.

19:56:52 A launch trajectory is located.
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:56:56 You kiss Lily Kaise.

19:56:59 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:57:00 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.

19:57:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:57:06 Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

19:57:06 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:57:15 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:57:16 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:57:26 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

19:57:43 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:57:43 The ship jerks slightly as the ant carrying it turns abruptly to avoid marching over a stone.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 2.0.

19:57:50 Lily Kaise says, "Heh ants."

19:57:53 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:58:02 You say, "The ants go marching one by one."

19:58:12 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:58:12 The hull creaks and buckles as another ant grasps the ship in its mandibles, taking control of carrying it in a new direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 0.0, 0.0.
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

19:58:22 Lily Kaise says, "Wow we missed it again this is screwy."

19:58:28 Lily Kaise turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the riftsail to 50%.

19:58:28 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

19:58:45 Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

19:58:45 The hull creaks and buckles as another ant grasps the ship in its mandibles, taking control of carrying it in a new direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 0.0, -1.0.

19:59:06 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

19:59:06 This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:59:18 Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.

19:59:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

19:59:25 Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

19:59:27 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

19:59:35 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

20:00:24 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

20:00:29 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

20:00:36 Lily kisses you long and passionately.

20:00:36 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

20:00:40 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

20:00:43 Lily Kaise stands up from a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:00:53 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

20:00:55 I don't understand that.

20:00:58 You turn off the silent running feature.

20:01:00 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

20:01:00 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

20:01:00 Lily Kaise smiles.

20:01:02 Lily Kaise glides up.

20:01:02 You smile.

20:01:06 I don't see that here.

20:01:08 I don't see that here.

(20 seconds roundtime.)

20:30:43 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)

20:30:43 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a compact purple microwave oven, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) here.

20:31:18 Lily Kaise says, "I had her in my arms heh."

21:06:36 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

21:33:20 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a compact purple microwave oven, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, and Lily Kaise (League Paladin) he

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

22:54:24 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

23:28:44 [Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
