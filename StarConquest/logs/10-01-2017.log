00:00:28 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:00:39 Johnathon Triggs says, "A research project I believe.."

00:00:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

00:01:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm well that might pop out there in space soemwhere."

00:01:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

00:01:19 Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:01:32 Johnathon says to Lily, "Having autovector might help."

00:01:43 Johnathon Triggs says, "Sooo... tedious with out it."

00:01:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Always be vigilent with that starmap."

00:02:01 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:02:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or observing what's in the sectors."

00:03:04 Johnathon Triggs says, "I've flown through... hmm... over a couple dozen sectors.. watching the starmaps.. or the rundowns.. but, nothing."

00:03:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh it will likely involve considerably more."

00:03:29 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:03:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't suggest sectors with beacons in them."

00:04:30 Johnathon says to Lily, "Oh, I don't mean beaconed sectors.. I mean sectors that are uncharted and unbeaconed... nothing but you.. space.. and RATS."

00:04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

00:04:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah it can be a stubborn item to find, no doubt!"

00:05:13 Johnathon Triggs says, "Been searching in my cargo hauler, just because it has some longer lasting battery power."

00:05:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

00:05:47 Johnathon Triggs says, "Makes a big difference between 2.5 hours and 5 or 6 hours."

00:05:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It sure does."

00:05:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

00:06:05 Johnathon Triggs removes a charge booster from a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

00:06:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Johnathon Triggs.

00:06:18 Johnathon Triggs says, "If.. that's not enough. I got a backup."

00:06:19 Johnathon Triggs grins.

00:06:22 Johnathon Triggs puts a charge booster in a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

00:07:11 Johnathon Triggs says, "Or... can simply put one together... If in case I need one more."

00:07:12 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

00:07:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes I'm glad you carry those. So many newer pilots get in a big jamb because they don't think of the need to carry those with them."

00:07:27 Johnathon Triggs says, "But.. but.. but.. want.. need autovector."

00:07:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."

00:07:54 Johnathon Triggs asks, "By the way... what's a hatch repair kit for?"

00:08:15 Johnathon Triggs says, "Don't hear many ships have their hatch breached."

00:08:37 Johnathon Triggs says, "Or.. any tools around that can do so."

00:08:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You'll need 300 industry though and I don't think that you can earn that much until you have your application approved."

00:09:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or did they change it? I have no idea anymore."

00:09:02 Johnathon says to Lily, "Thought it was 200."

00:09:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope not for autovector."

00:09:19 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:09:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "200 is for the navaid and jet."

00:09:31 Johnathon Triggs asks, "What was it for 200?"

00:09:34 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:09:36 Johnathon Triggs says, "Right."

00:10:02 Johnathon Triggs asks, "What's the Navid?"

00:10:09 Johnathon Triggs says, "Navaid."

00:10:30 Johnathon Triggs asks, "It detects artifacts?"

00:11:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You need the navigational aid when you are spacewalking so that you can gage your location and look out for other ships and things in the sector."

00:11:16 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:11:26 Johnathon Triggs says, "Ah. Ok."

00:11:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then the jet keeps you more stable or you will have a very difficult time moving."

00:11:57 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:12:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If you ever got to go over to Helios into the mall over there, there's no gravity."

00:12:12 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:12:20 Johnathon Triggs says, "Like.. drydock."

00:12:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or over on Drydock as well."

00:12:27 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

00:12:28 Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:12:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

00:12:32 I don't see that here.

00:12:36 You wave to Johnathon Triggs.

00:12:44 Johnathon Triggs waves to you.

00:13:54 Johnathon says to Lily, "Bet you i'll be on the top preformers list this time through."

00:13:56 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

00:13:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yay."

00:14:18 You grin.

00:14:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I honestly have no idea how I even placed last time. The only work I did was a skirmish or two but I didn't do any other work."

00:14:57 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Though... I should try to finish off one more low deployment.. maybe?"

00:15:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Sure!"

00:15:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I used to do all of mine every conquest."

00:15:21 You say, "It certainly couldn't hurt unless you get blow up."

00:15:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There will be a time when you can't."

00:15:39 Johnathon says to Lily, "I'm surprised I didn't rank up there. I did a bit before it ended.."

00:15:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah please try not to explode!"

00:15:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We at least made it to our first goal."

00:16:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:16:06 You exclaim, "Nice!"

00:16:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

00:16:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's been weeks."

00:16:20 Johnathon says to you, "THere's been once that I was close to blowing up... was hating that I switched from chains to lasers on the rental."

00:16:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."

00:16:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Lasers at that level are pretty weak."

00:16:54 Johnathon Triggs says, "I need to get a laser booster."

00:16:55 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:16:58 Johnathon Triggs says, "They are."

00:17:03 You say, "True."

00:17:32 Johnathon Triggs asks, "What's the next stronger laser?"

00:17:42 Johnathon Triggs says, "Strongest.."

00:17:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well when you do Tesla missions, once you start drawing poachers, you will occasionally get one to drop a module for you."

00:18:02 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:18:05 Johnathon Triggs says, "Nice."

00:18:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Also as you know on nests as well."

00:18:14 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:18:31 Johnathon Triggs says, "I got my evasion one from a tiny nest, with the SVP>."

00:18:38 You grin.

00:18:57 Johnathon Triggs exclaims, "I was like.. oh, look! Gold!"

00:19:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

00:19:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah those drop modules sometiems too."

00:19:46 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:19:50 You grin.

00:20:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So always always do as many of the sVP as you can as trust me it will end when you achieve a certain number of industry."

00:20:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And ground."

00:20:18 You say, "Yeah."

00:20:21 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Hmm.. currently have 30 tesla points.. at what point do the poachers start coming?"

00:20:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "250 Ground."

00:20:37 You nod.

00:20:46 Johnathon Triggs says, "Ah."

00:21:00 Johnathon Triggs asks, "So enjoy the quite walks of the mines till then.. huh?"

00:21:02 Johnathon Triggs grins.

00:21:09 You say, "Exactly."

00:21:37 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:21:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes and enjoy that peace haha."

00:21:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:21:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Those poachers can be a bit caustic."

00:21:59 Johnathon Triggs nods.

00:22:02 You chuckle.

00:22:03 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:22:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chortles.

00:22:24 Johnathon Triggs asks, "What was the points required for tier 2 Rental?"

00:22:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I have no idea it's been too long!"

00:22:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:22:45 You laugh. "Me neither."

00:22:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Probably around 500? I don't know."

00:22:55 Johnathon says to Lily, "What good GSL you are."

00:22:58 Johnathon Triggs grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:23:03 You chuckle.

00:23:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't have a photographic memory about some aspects."

00:23:14 Johnathon Triggs says, "Thought I heard lower..."

00:23:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

00:23:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope I think it's only for tier 1."

00:23:37 Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

00:23:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You're lucky it's not tier 3."

00:23:55 Johnathon says to Lily, "Hmm?"

00:24:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Tier 3 for our suit is 750."

00:24:25 Johnathon Triggs sighs.

00:24:26 A black laminate filing cabinet is already open.

00:24:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So typically for another alliance or other suit it would be higher than that."

00:25:46 Johnathon Triggs says, "I am slowly, more and more, growing to regret getting the rental.. Just because of the pain it is for upgrading the suit."

00:26:07 Johnathon Triggs says, "Points wise.. at any rate."

00:26:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't feel comfortable when a higher points pilot brings a tier 2 becaue you can add abilities and weapons which are higher than the typical tier 2 so it's no longer a true tier 2 at that point."

00:45:18 You say, "Well, that'd certainly take a while. 59k that is."

00:45:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I hope I earn 500 mil though so it's worthit."

00:45:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup."

00:45:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's a sweet deal though."

00:45:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I can't wait to get a radioactive."

00:47:18 You say, "That would be fun."

00:55:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am sincere in what I do and no matter how some may twist it, you know I could be toatlly selfish and offer absolutely nothing to anyone.

00:59:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "However, had you had your org still, I would have been happy to join you Love."

00:59:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

01:00:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I'm at 86 percent and up to 429 mil woo!"

01:22:19 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:22:34 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:23:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok i'm at 466 mil and 94 percent so only have about 4 or 5 percent more to earn addiitonal."

01:23:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Additional."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

16:11:12 Lily says to you, "Hi Love."

16:11:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

16:13:21 You smile.

16:14:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "56 converted so a little more than halfway done so you know the second half goes faster. I'd say in a couple of hours or less."

16:14:46 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

16:14:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

16:14:59 You sit down on a large leather couch.

16:30:17 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Camp too."

16:30:27 [Tactical Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm up for a camp."

16:30:47 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "We will do a camp."

16:31:06 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Tier?"

16:31:14 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I don't care."

16:31:51 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "You sort of need to care. If the League is not a 5, we don't need to bring other 5's."

16:33:26 [Tactical Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I have fives in league, fringe, and EAOS, also AEU but I'm not bringin' that."

16:33:40 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Whatever you want, Fringe would be good."

16:57:42 You laugh. "It's fine."

16:57:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

16:58:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well I suppose if you really had to leave or wanted to you would. I mean, we certainly can survive a few hours away from one another."

16:58:33 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

16:58:37 You say, "Yeah."

16:59:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

17:03:24 You say to Lily, "I love you."

17:04:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was doing some estimates on what it will require sEAS to maintain what we currently have. It costs 7.3 billion per year to support a cruiser. so if we start to drift below 10 billion, then I would ask you to start to contribute something towards the support of your cruiser. This would have been more critical if we were not added back to at least some of the income-producing stations."

17:05:05 You say, "That's fine. I'm happy to help."

17:05:09 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

17:06:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're doing fine currently and since we've been able to obtain all of our infrastructure and the greater majority of Organization ships, I'd say a good balance to maintain is somewhere between 25 to 30 billion and if we drop below, then I'll be asking more of members."

17:06:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Below 10 billion."

17:06:42 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Ok."

17:06:50 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

17:07:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I would appreciate it though if we can push our combat up to 2500."

17:07:14 You nod and smile.

17:07:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We also need to push Industry up to about 8000."

17:07:22 You nod.

17:07:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And Exploration needs more but I won't emphasize that right now."

17:08:01 You nod.

17:08:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The reason for the industry is for the higher salvage and Asteroid processor modules."

17:08:30 You nod and grin.

17:08:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The combat is for the next level of BAS."

17:08:37 You say, "Right."

17:08:40 You smile.

17:09:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Noone can contribute more than 25 percent now anyway so that's nota lot to ask."

17:09:29 You say, "That's true. We can't."

17:10:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll never mandate things. I'm just saying that I'd appreciate help with maintaining certain aspects and with working towards certain goals."

17:10:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

17:11:36 You nod and smile. "I'm happy to do what I can to help."

17:15:09 "Thanks!" Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

17:15:42 You exclaim, "Of course!"

17:15:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I probably will post something. I just need to organize what I want to say."

17:15:54 You nod and grin.

17:17:23 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Now, is anybody up for beacons?"

17:17:50 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Yep."

17:18:40 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

17:19:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is why it's such a pain when people like Erik Goodwin is so short-sighted as to why an organization needs the benefit of participation if they want to help others.. We can't convert credits to megacredits until we've achieved 2000 Command so when we start running low on Megacredits without any resources, then our Scoop would be our only source which would still enable us to put up some stations independently. We'd only need to buy the main processor via the org and a core because the other modules can be bought by individuals. so we'd manage ok in spite of things."

17:20:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But he seems to have this attitude that it's all for just me and it's not."

17:20:10 You nod.

17:21:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have a list of individuals who I won't pay any attention to and currently they are Emily Ford, Erik Goodwin, Morris and a couple others."

17:21:10 You grin.

17:21:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

17:21:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm surprised that Ali is letting him get away with tis though. I didn't think Ali had any issues with me or SEAS."

17:22:09 You say, "Yeah, I didn't think so either."

17:23:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I say though, I imagine that Erik will burnout on that particular project as it does requireeffort to trek out there to renew the stations. I sure wouldn't want that job. However, if Melinda asked us to do it, we would."

17:25:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have been considering a little excursion to GMG."

17:25:46 You nod.

17:25:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Since my carrier can accomodate a module scout plus 5 Geminis, we could invite Tara and Constantine so that we can get their colors for them plus 3 more geminis."

17:26:19 You say, "Well, we need to figure out how to get to the other side of the skim first."

17:26:33 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

17:26:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we could get Ather to go along with us it would really be great. Anyone who wanted to go back before we did could always rift back."

17:27:20 You nod.

17:43:44 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Now that breakfast is over, beacons?"

17:43:56 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Would love to get a morningstar up if I can."

18:15:39 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

18:15:41 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

18:16:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

18:16:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Almost done."

18:16:17 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "No worries."

18:16:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Ok well 490 mil from this one and 99 percent conversion and 49 points. I'll take that!"

18:17:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

18:17:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Take it to the baaaaank!"

18:17:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

18:18:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Woo 490 mil for a Metal Rich 99 percent conversion and 49 points. I completed anotehr Metal Rich earlier at 100 percent conversion and 50 points and it paid just under 496 mil. So Metal Rich asteroids for the stars!"

18:18:42 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

18:18:45 You cheer for Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident!

18:18:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ooops."

18:18:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have a problem."

18:19:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I can't complete it yet. Let me see when I can."

18:19:14 You say, "Oh."

18:19:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok I have to wait 31 minutes."

18:20:11 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

18:20:15 You say to Lily, "No problem."

18:20:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But if you need to go do something, I can meet up with you later."

18:20:25 You say, "I can wait."

18:20:28 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

18:20:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Ok you are a patient soul!"

18:20:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

18:21:08 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

18:21:42 You say, "We'll have to leave in two separate ships anyways. I want to bring my flare along."

18:21:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "True."

18:22:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is why I said if you needed to go check office and do other things, do whatever you need to or you could have anyway which is why I suggested bringing another ship for you."

18:22:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

18:22:49 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

18:37:31 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]

18:37:31 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

18:37:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

18:37:33 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

18:37:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:37:34 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

18:37:38 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:37:38 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:37:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:37:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:37:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:37:52 The ship is already moving.

18:37:53 The ship is already moving.

18:37:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:37:55 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:37:55 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:37:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

18:37:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:38:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:38:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:38:02 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:38:03 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

18:38:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:38:05 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

20:24:28 You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Greetings Everyone! Here's an update on our Temporary Space Station participation. So far, we've been included on both the Salvage processing station in Belt of Orion and in Artifact Alpha 777. Just Please note that Evenia has put Fringe Cores on those stations in Artifact Alpha 777. So you will only earn fringe Credits when you transfer salvage on the Salvage Processor in Artifact alpha 777. You will also need Fringe Credits to pay for any necessary repairs which you obtain from the Watchtower in Artifact alpha 777. I haven't been able to determine the remaining power on the Asteroid processor in 285 but I am hopeful that once the current Asteroid processor goes offline, that we will be included in the next build. The Deep Space Operations station in Belt of Orion, which is utilized for Salvage Operations, goes offline in about 15 hours as of this posting. That type of station isn't deployed on a continuous basis but I would imagine that SEAS will be included on any future builds. The Xenology station in Belt of Orion still has about 8 days of power remaining. This means that anything researched there at this time will provide no benefit to SEAS. If you are in need of your Credits and Points, then it's ok to Research your artifacts on the current station. However, if you can wait until the next deployment of the Xenology Station, this means income for SEAS as well as we typically do earn Command Points from Xenology Scanners. Anytime you are able to Research Artifacts when SEAS is a contributor to a Xenology Station, it will be very beneficial to SEAS. Additionally, SEAS is not being included on the Temporary Space Stations deployed in 287, the Radio bubble area. This is of no consequence as we don't earn any income even when we do contribute. We like to contribute because we're at least giving something back to support another vital income-producing area. We are not going to be added to the out of Comms Asteroid Cluster. This is thanks to Erik Goodwin who as you all know has a rather ugly attitude in general. This Asteroid Cluster yields very nice income and a little extra in points as well as Asteroid hauling provides Command points to SEAS. However, it isn't utilized by many pilots because one has to travel to 287 and then to 288 to reach this area. Most don't want to take the extra time as well as one must qualify for the Comms Override Upgrade from the Torus Xenology Center to be able to navigate back to the Asteroid Processor from another sector. Not many follow through to maintain the 288 Asteroid Cluster so one can hope that a change in management in the future will yield more friendly results for SEAS. Last, we are not being included on the Temporary Space Stations which support travel to and from GMG. There is a Toll station which requires a 20,0
20:24:28 00,000 Credits Toll and this yielded about a million in income to SEAS. This is nice income but it is not a heavily utilized area so we'll not be losing anything significant for not being included on the Temporary Stations which access GMG. This is because of Damien Goss who, as you know has a similar perspective as Goodwin's. As I said in the message I posted, we've at least made some progress on being able to earn income for our organization again and for that I am deeply grateful. [18:01  1 October 2317 GST]

21:24:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:24:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:24:32  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a black engineering tool case.
