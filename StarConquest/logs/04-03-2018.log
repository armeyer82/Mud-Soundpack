-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

02:02 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and a dark violet fabric loveseat here.
You can go out.

02:04 You sit down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:04 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

02:04 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:04 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

02:05 You scramble to your feet.

02:06 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "A Shule!"

02:06 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:06 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:06 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "A Shule? Where?"

02:06 Keegan Wantz says, "Haven't seen you active terribly much out here."

02:06 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:06 Keegan Wantz asks, "Too comfy in Lily's embrace?"

02:06 You laugh.

02:06 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:06 You say to Keegan, "Yeah sorry. I haven't been active much out here."

02:07 Keegan Wantz says, "Eh, shit happens."

02:08 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

02:08 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:09 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

02:09 [Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Control Room]

02:09 A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a dark violet fabric armchair, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a black plastic box labeled 'Photos', an Accord long-range sensor technician, a black plastic paper dispenser, a large crystal ball, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
Hawthorn Dunn, Alko Delovega, Keegan Wantz, and Lily Kaise are standing here.
You can go south and out.

02:11 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

02:11 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:11 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

02:12 Keegan Wantz says, "Hmm."

02:12 Keegan Wantz says, "Making reasonably okay time, whew."

02:12 Lily Kaise nods.

02:12 You nod.

02:13 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:13 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.
Keegan Wantz says, "We were at 47% when we hopped back into the rift."

02:13 Keegan Wantz says, "Now we're at 50%."

02:19 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

02:19 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:19 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

02:19 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "ZAP."

02:21 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:21 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

02:21 Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Iww."

02:22 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow throw a tantrum now wont you!"

02:22 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:22 You laugh.

02:22 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I like this on e though."

02:22 You say, "I guess someone was a poor looser."

02:22 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "This one."

02:23 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed black sofa.

02:23 Lily Kaise carefully buckles her seatbelt.

02:23 You sit down on an overstuffed black sofa.

02:23 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:23 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:24 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Woo up to 51 on NDB and 85 on the Long-Range NDB."

02:24 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

02:24 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:25 Lily Kaise says, "Eek."

02:25 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

02:25 Lily Kaise says, "Zap goes the Rift Drive."

02:28 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

02:28 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:28 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

02:29 Lily Kaise says, "Be right back as I need to feed a ittle izie."

02:29 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed black sofa.

02:29 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:30 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

02:30 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:30 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

02:31 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:31 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed black sofa.

02:31 Lily Kaise carefully buckles her seatbelt.

02:32 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

02:33 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

02:33 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:33 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

02:35 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

02:36 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

02:36 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:36 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

02:37 Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Lovely speed."

02:40 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

02:40 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:40 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

02:41 Alko Delovega says into the PA microphone, "Calling us names now?"

02:41 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh, Lily."

02:41 Keegan Wantz says, "Keep Asteria on the main ship while we undock the seers I think."

02:41 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "NO. Just you specifically."

02:41 Keegan Wantz says, "Just in case the sightseers have no power when we undock."

02:42 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "52%!"

02:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:43 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

02:43 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:43 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

02:44 Lily Kaise says to Keegan, "Yeah I definitley will as she seemed to wander off last when we docked."

02:44 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "It was actually worse than that but it's at least resolved."

02:45 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

02:45 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:46 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

02:48 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

02:48 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:52 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

02:52 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:52 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

02:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:54 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed black sofa.

02:54 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:54 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

02:54 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed black sofa.

02:54 Lily Kaise carefully buckles her seatbelt.

02:54 Lily Kaise says, "Drive still holding up."

02:55 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

02:55 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:55 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

02:58 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

02:58 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

02:58 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

03:02 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:02 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:03 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

03:03 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:03 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

03:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:06 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

03:06 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:07 Keegan Wantz says, "I am somewhat glad."

03:07 Keegan Wantz says, "We are constantly shifting scenes."

03:07 You nod.

03:07 Keegan Wantz says, "Whew."

03:07 Keegan Wantz says, "We've already made it 8% back since we started this storm ride."

03:07 You say, "Ah ok."

03:07 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:08 Keegan Wantz says, "Only about an hour and a half, even."

03:08 Keegan Wantz says, "Not bad."

03:11 Keegan Wantz says, "If the storm holds, it'd only be nine hours until we're home."

03:11 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

03:11 Keegan Wantz says, "Doubt that, though."

03:11 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Never know!"

03:11 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:11 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

03:11 Lily Kaise says, "But yeah not likely it will and we'll likely have to repair at least a couple more times."

03:14 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

03:14 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:14 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:14 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

03:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:15 Keegan Wantz says, "Ooer."

03:17 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

03:17 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

03:17 Listen. You need to be careful.

03:17 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "I just fucking fixed this rift gods I just. Fucking, fixed this."

03:17 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ready?"

03:18 Blake Madison walks in from the south.

03:18 Ryan Thomas roams in from the south.

03:18 You remove a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger from a leather briefcase.

03:18 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the south.

03:18 Hawthorn Dunn sighs.

03:18 You remove a hyperspanner from a leather briefcase.

03:18 Keegan Wantz presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Ryan Thomas removes spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side and quickly dons them.

03:18 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "We've been in a storm the whole time, ha."

03:18 Keegan Wantz presses a large button marked CYCLE.

03:18 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

03:18 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

03:18 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

03:22 You put a hyperspanner in a leather briefcase.

03:22 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:22 [Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Base Block]

03:22 You see a modern elk print couch, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Business Cats", a personal hoverpallet, and a small white trash bin here.

03:22 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

03:22 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

03:22 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed black sofa.

03:22 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

03:22 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

03:22 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:23 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

03:23 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Ant power!"

03:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:24 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:24 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:25 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

03:25 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:26 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

03:29 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

03:29 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:29 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

03:35 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

03:35 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:35 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

03:38 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

03:39 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

03:39 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:39 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

03:41 Lily Kaise slides a "Happy" key off of an enameled purple space cat keyring.

03:42 The horses cease their panic, and breathe hard as they resume a more normal pace.

03:42 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

03:42 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

03:43 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

03:43 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:43 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

03:48 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Oh."

03:48 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh."

03:48 Keegan Wantz puts a hyperspanner in a navy blue canvas backpack.

03:48 Keegan says to Lily, "Sorry."

03:48 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Sorry."

03:48 Keegan Wantz puts a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger in a navy blue canvas backpack.

03:48 Keegan Wantz removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a creased black flightbag.

03:49 Lily Kaise nods.

03:49 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:49 Lily Kaise gives a "Happy" key to Keegan Wantz.

03:49 Keegan Wantz slides a "Happy" key onto an intricate silver dragon keychain.

03:49 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

03:49 Lily Kaise says, "Just in case I am not coherent enough when you have to undock tings."

03:49 Keegan Wantz nods.

03:49 Lily Kaise says, "I'll move all valuables offsite."

03:51 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

03:51 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:51 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

03:53 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

03:53 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:53 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

03:59 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

03:59 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

03:59 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

04:00 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed black sofa.

04:00 Lily Kaise glides south.

04:01 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

04:01 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

04:01 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

04:03 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

04:03 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

04:05 You stand up from an overstuffed black sofa.

04:05 You carefully buckle your seatbelt.

04:05 Keegan Wantz says, "Only about a hundred and twenty out."

04:06 Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:08 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:08 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

04:08 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

04:08 Listen. You need to be careful.

04:08 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:08 Lily Kaise says, "Kitcat follow."

04:08 KitCat the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Caretaking task has been canceled."

04:11 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:11 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:17 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

04:21 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Woo 59 and 88 on the NDB respectively."

04:23 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Pretty sure it's the same storm."

04:23 Keegan Wantz strides south.

04:23 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It is."

04:24 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

04:24 Keegan Wantz turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the riftsail to 5%.

04:24 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

04:24 Keegan Wantz strides south.

04:24 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

04:24 Keegan Wantz turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the riftsail to 100%.

04:25 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah was about to say as we're actually moving away from it."

04:28 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "So who has a Testudinidae Mission pending? Could help if needed. Ather Shule and I did the first one."

04:30 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:42 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]

04:42 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

04:50 You say to Lily, "Night my love. Rest well and sweet dreams. I love you too."

04:59 In the end, you can't really trust anyone but yourself, can you?

05:00 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

05:08 Remember what I said.

05:09 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

05:38 The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.

05:42 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

05:52 The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and closing. It then abruptly swims off.

06:03 Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish eagerly gobble them up.

06:11 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

06:11 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

06:16 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

06:32 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

06:42 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

06:47 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

06:58 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

07:03 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

07:12 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

07:13 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

07:18 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

07:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

07:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:33 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

07:43 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:06 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

08:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:14 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

08:14 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

08:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:24 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

08:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:06 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

09:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:15 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

09:16 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

09:16 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

09:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:46 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

09:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:56 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

10:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:04 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm awake."

10:07 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

10:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:17 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

10:17 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

10:17 Listen. You need to be careful.

10:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:41 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Why are we going this way?"

10:41 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Right."

10:42 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And we are almost home."

10:42 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wee."

10:43 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're looking at what like four more hours or something?"

10:47 Is it really worth it? This?

10:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:58 So much pain. For what?

11:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

11:08 Don't let them trick you.

11:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:18 Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.

11:19 Remember what I said.

11:19 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

11:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

11:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

11:48 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

11:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

11:58 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

12:00 [Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]

12:00 A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.
