Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole
drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an
insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

ftl the torus
l
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, an insulated purple sleeping bag,
and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

[Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Beta.

heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked

The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and
purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.
The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their
seats.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
[PA] Johann Schraft: "Going to bed Mel?"
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing
on the hull.
Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated
minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.
Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated
minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.
Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that
even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.
The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.
The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of
fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.
The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly
ejected into swirling mist.
A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily
decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.
You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place
seems to go on forever.
You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place
seems to go on forever.
You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night.
Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over
an overturned tree.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around
them.

A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What do we do to get the best use out of
debris sensors? I feel like I want to scan for the closest debris then head for
it, but does that fit the actual intent of it? For sure, it's a little tough for
me to figure out the coordinates based on the vector from my position at this
point."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Since it helps determine the type of
debris and grade, it will help you make a dicision based on that."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And as your points go up, you will get
sensors that will make that easier still."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For example, if you're supposed to get
bari corpses for SVP, you can scan and only go for the bari corpses. Or if you
wanted only comet for a reason, then you can go to only comets. Or only the
higher grade...or whatever. And yes, your sensors will eventually scan the
entire sector."
The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a
refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Roger that. So when I see something I
want, how do I go to it? Sounds like a stupid question but, are people just
using manual mode or something."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Personally I find the coordinates of
the chunk I want, and then put those coordinates into the computer."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. You can move to its coordinates.
So...if you're at 10 10 10 and there's two chunks in range, look at the rundown
and find the one that matches up the closest in direction and distance."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "When you have a better scanner, you'll
notice that there are as many debris chunks as there are on the rundown when it
scans. They're displayed in the same order on both."
[Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "With the early sensors, it can be as
easy to just find the chunks on the rundown and move to each in turn."
A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle
around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the
distance.

The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the
landscape below.
The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think
it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.
[Newbie Help] Led chuncks Jake Smith transmits, "Is there a way to turn the
confermation for fireing and for moveing out of the sectors?"
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[Newbie Help] Led chuncks Jake Smith transmits, "Turn it off."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They're two different things."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For moving out of sectors, you want
PROMPT."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, type prompt while in the control
room for sector exit prompts."
[Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Ok got it. What about
the other."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For firing, there's a device that can be
purchased, but keep in mind it is considered illegal in alliance space."
[Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Yo yo yo, strange. Nvm
then. Haha."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't
use it. Just be aware of the possible outcome."

The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight.
The scene abruptly fades.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren
hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as
glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and
humans caught in the blast litter the ground.
[Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There's some timelines on the web site
that give more of the history than the help files do, one sec let me see if I
can find it again."
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine
where they are coming from.
Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic
crater.
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "How do I use a temporary wormhole
drive?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Bolt it down in your control room."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Bolt it in your engineering room then
jump."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or engineering room, if your ship has one
of those."
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Thank you."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "If you have several jumps to make, you
might use a temp wormhole drive every jump."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Your best plan is to jump to a main
sector like Earthgate or Providence Gate, etc."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Those sectors will usually have repair
centers, which you can stop and have your drive fixed at."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. I believe the ones purchased at
stores and the first tier one on workbenches only do one jump per drive. But
it's been awhile since I've used one."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I think the first tier workbench one does
two, but don't quote me on it. You're right about the store bought ones though."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, that's quite possible. The
improved are four I believe."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They are."
Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic
crater.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the
ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whaaat, the rundown and movelist
display chunks in the same order?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not the movelist."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn, I've been doing the math this
whole time."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The rundown and the debris scanner."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The debris list from the scanner, I
thought you meant."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow, that's great to know."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The movelist only shows the closest
debris."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "There's actually an option to have it
show everything, Morris, last I checked. It's just very spammy."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh yeah. There is. I didn't think anyone
used that. Heh."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I turned it on for all of 10 seconds
once..."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "If I see 26 of something, can I get 10 or
them?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not of not disassembled components, no."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...are you talking workbench?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If they're already on your workbench,
it'll pop up with a menu and you can pick how many you want to take."
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok."
[Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Is there a way to see
what the weapons of the battle suits do before you buy them? I got the pistle
and the hand grenades but was tempted to buy the mistle. The pain!"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Other pilots would know and be able to
answer questions about them."
The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.
The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and
closing. It then abruptly swims off.
The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns
to place it on another conveyor belt.
You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.
Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.
The heat lessens just slightly.
Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.
[Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "How do you turn the pa locked on
or off?"
[Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Pa on, or pa off."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Pa on and pa off."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It shows in the room description, so you
don't get caught off guard."

A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other,
then places it back on the conveyor belt.
An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a
high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.
Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along
with yours.
Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades
to mist.
You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, a compact white
refrigerator, a black plastic trash can, a sheet of pink paper, an elegant
