Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Lileah Rose says to you, "I love you too sexy man."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I wouldn't
worry. There are plenty of suckers for lost causes who believe that everyone
deserves a second chance. Or a third, or a fourth, or a fifth depending on how
many times he's punched the bus driver."

you became a rogue pilot."

right, get you rogue status?"

do. Build a temp station with a fusion battery on it, stick him there. Let him
cool off and catch up on current events for a couple months, then the station's

get."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I try to tell
people politely not to send me that shit without sending them one back, but most
of them are too caught up in themselves to get the message."

inside of boxes inside of boxes."

finally seemed to work last year. No one sent me anything."

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have never sent you
trash-throwing shit, ever."

wasn't an annual festive holiday gift."

than they were worth."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Incidentally, I
am still buying omnilocks, at double the price they're being sold for on SSN!
Buy them, send them to me, and I will send you money!"

nothing to do?"

make sure to blow up your ship in the process. Do that, and you'll get the words
all right."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "You can try to
steal things and such, I suppose. Our prisons are less luxurious than moon

can be trapped here with no way home I suppose."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I think I'll pass. I
like all my ships quite well."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, prisons don't cost 100000
credits a night for a room. That's what tax payers are for."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And if I somehow
managed to lose a ship and get stuck out there. I guarantee you a friend would
come get me. Because...Oh right. I didn't punch a bus driver."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sleep on the
docking bay like a common begger. Maybe someone will take pity on you."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I can just see you doing that.
You, and that kind loving attitude of yours."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am, as I
said, glorious philanthropist! I can have a fusion temp station ready to go in
moments."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, and leave me stranded
somewhere for months? Just for punching a bus driver, you've got as much sense,
or rather, you don't."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "If you ever did that to
someone for something short of murder or grand larcany, you should be locked up
yourself."

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm going to regret
asking this. I know it. But why would you punch him. Anyway?"

stealing ships?"

[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I was the only person he
brought to this place in the middle of nowhere."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So you're all pissy,
and you decide to punch a bus driver. That logic doesn't even add up."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "But him and his criffing
schedule."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm actually
more of a fan of certain other punishments for murderers, myself!"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I was ready to leave hours
ago, and I knew I'd be the only passenger."

something here. Someone please explain. But. That just makes zero sense."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Wasted battery
power?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I was there. Not a sole
boarded his transport, and he kept shoving me out the damn airlock."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "He could've made some real
cash."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Leaguers should
definitely think of trying to shut up this guy sooner rather than later."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ali, go to it!"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "He doesn't make any money you
know, and he could've charged me millions, and I'd of paid him."

there's only one around. But at least he holds an office."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Bus driver
receives super generous salary from mighty Nouveau Quebec Ministry of Tourism,
or maybe a different one. Many of them, you know."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, when it
comes to you repeatedly punching someone just because they have a schedule to
keep, I understand why he wouldn't want to be cooped up on a ship with you for
potentially hours. You represented a clear and present threat. I'd have told you
to go fuck yourself and flown off on my own too."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Agreed."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "A schedule to keep? You make
it sound like he was in a hurry."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one runs on
"James'" time. They run on their schedules. If you can't work with their
schedules, then either bring your own stupid transport next time or don't go at
all."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The spacebus
has, and will always have a schedule. There is no reason that I can see that he
could've changed that scheduled departure just for the likes of you."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I will. Me, the cadet, will go
magically bring his rift drive capable transport with enough charge to fly for
several hours straight."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Try cutting power to your mouth.
Might boost charge."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And, how would I get my
handstr g I've got nothing else to do."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Obviously too
late for right now, but you should've realized when you were going on the
spacebus that no one cares when you want to leave, your time is not relevant."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You'd think they'd run more
than one per day."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "What does the guy do for the
other 20 hours."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Front them your
generous 4 million credits for the pickup and maybe they'll consider it."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa chortles.
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I ffing will. As long as you
aren't the pilot, then I may just have a reason to punch someone else. You've
gotten me even more riled up than I was earlier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "This is all too
amusing. I've hardly noticed that I'm out hauling roids alone."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Can't possibly
be that he might have a wife? A family? Maybe a business? Regardless, what
business is it of yours?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So...Now you're
threatening whoever comes to get you?"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Keep talking,
champ. Keep talking."

marginally intreagued."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh man. Okay, okay.. that's
just too much."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just for that
comment, I'm going to look forward to seeing you back. Cause I'm going to strand
your ass soon as I see you for calling me a her."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Let's see. I've got, let's
say, another 23 and a half hours to wait?"
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "This is bad for
tourism. Save us, Honorable Premier Maxime Roberge!"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And hopefully
he'll still tell you to go fuck yourself when he sees you again."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ather, you sound like a her,
and you've got that cat-fighting mentality too."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "In fact, Mr.
Busdriver, I will donate 500 million credits to the spacebus industry thing if
you ban him from all future travel on your bus!"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "How the hell was I supposed to
know. It's not like we've met."

[General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry, but
I have to agree with Aisling on that one."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, but I never threatened to
strand someone."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "No, only to steal ships."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They aren't
threats if they're going to be carried out. At least I'm actually aiming my
desire for destruction towards the intended target. Not some innocent person who
was just doing their job."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Why did he punch the
spacebus driver?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And in what universe, does the
legal system punnish a common brawler with a month's solitary inprisonment in
the middle of nowhere? That sounds like something our enemies would do, not us."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause he's a
fucking lunatic."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That was after I got stranded,
mind you."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Supposedly he
was saying that the busdriver wouldn't budge from his schedule cause poor pretty
little James wanted to go home early or some shit."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's about
the jist of it."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well get naked and enjoy
yourself."

[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm surprised the marzore clan
or some other trading organization inside the mutuality doesn't have business
dealings here."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It wouldn't be any of your
business if they did or didn't."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "It would, if I stood in the
docking bay all day, looking for ships. I'd be happy to see a smuggler right
about now."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You sure about that? He might
harvest your organs him or herself."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well then, I'd be dead
wouldn't I. At this point, I'd be willing to take risk. The only ships I
wouldn't want to see would be outsiders or ifs."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, throw on a space suit
and jump. There's a risk there. You might make it back, but you probably won't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Will resist urge to
weigh in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's been trying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It is in my own best
interests not to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Guy has been
prattling on like a child for the better part of an hour."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You don't think I haven't
tried that? It'd be easier with a distress beacon and a spacesuit, people would
be more likely to stop. I just need a spacesuit jet, and a way to override these
damn airlock controls. Then, maybe, passing ships might take a damn interest for
a change.. There'd at least be more to look at."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "They keep these airlocks
sealed."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "They would laugh at the
silly reg."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Dude. I'm sorry.
But...How long have you been there? The way you're whining and whining. you'd
swear you were stuck on a deserted planet. and you'd been there half a year."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Constantine knows my
favorite beacon...he can um...go there if he likes with this guy and um talk to
him."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well, time passes so criffing
slowly here, that it would most certainly feel like a year, even if a only a day
has past. The way I am right now, I know without a doubt, that sleeping is
impossible."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "At the rate
things are going, he'll either never get a ride back, or get a ride with the
very, very wrong person."
[General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human
wuharel oh 'ten minutes.'"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Go over to the area of
culture and look at people."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "All I have left to do is argue
with you and look at flight control. At least that gives me something to do."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...I guess that's
your problem. But for the love of all sanity, stop whining."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Wonder if I am the
"wrong person" you speak of?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Like I said, it gives me
something to do, and until I find something of worth or interest, either a way
to make money, or to get off this station, that's what I'll have to resort to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, I was
thinking more along the lines of hitching a ride with someone from Clan
Chevlier."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Also. Just think. If
you spent less time arguing and being stupid. And more time being polite. And
maybe had quite a bit of regret for what you did. You'd probably be on your way
home."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or something
along those lines."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I don't know though. The way
ather's been talking, even if I acted like an angel after what I did, I'd
probably still be here, throwing fake snowballs at the ceiling."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well you'll never
know now, will you. You clearly chose the stupid path."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The Free Port
Doctrine only protects you as long as you are on the station. If he gets on
board a ship with just anyone, they could fly off with him and never been sen
again."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "The stupid path. That's
pretty funny."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I might've behaved a little
differently if that criffing ace pilot hadn't wound me up."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Your problem for
letting him wind you up then, isn't it?"
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You're pretty easy to rattle
if you let Ather get under your skin."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "But I'm not going to just sit
here, and listen to people talk about me. I will respond, no matter how stupid I
sound. That may just be a flaw with me, but it's who I am."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "As far as I can tell, he's
only serious about the mean things he says half of the time."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've never met the dude. For
all I knew, he was serious."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd say more
like...73.57% of the time, but yeah."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What did Ather say?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Didn't this incident
with the driver happen way before Ather came on comms?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And if you'd never heard of
someone, and some ace pilot you didn't know started threatening to strand you
for a month, would you just sit still?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I feel like you are
misrepresenting Ather's role in you burning your bridges with every person."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well I wouldn't tempt
the pilot to do it in the first place. Because...I'm not stupid."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes, it did. But I didn't get
seriously riled until she started threatening to strand me."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Oops, what?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lordy."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And he's been gon e
from comms for quite a while now. Pretty sure he went to sleep."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ather, is a guy. Stop
with the calling him a woman shit."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've only started burning
bridges with you all when he came along."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Well at least he knows what he is
doing."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So one guy pisses you
off and you burn all the bridges? All of them?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All of them,
apparently."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Ather. And, how was I supposed
to know he is a guy? There's no, "ather's" a guy as part of his name or comlink
info. That name to me sounds like it could go either way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "He can keep this up
all he wants. Who wants popcorn?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, let's change the
subject."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey its not my nuts
on the fire today for once. I want to have a feast."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "0 for capsules."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or more than 0 for bigger
ships."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Why haven't we
cleaned the vents yet? I could so use that vodka."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man, let's clean the
vents."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was just waiting for you
to say it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "2 for vents clearing!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Bring us all the plasma
you got!"
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Damn. Vent cleaning means I
can't use that new suit."

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Are we gonna rock it
with 4?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If we can get a fourth."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll swap suits
begrudgingly."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Plasma is sexy, after all."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "New earth lounge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Vernos, keep
your eye open for a sector alert on Frontier Cluster while we're in there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What suit
should I bring? EAOS 5?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you don't
mind."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd much rather run
AEU for this. Eli. Could you bring league. Maybe?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "RATs 5?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, definitely
Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Al the
fives?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, you have a
rats 5?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Indeed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm. Either
of those would be way better than what Dak and I can bring."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm about 6 sectors
out with this roid, so I might be a minute."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if she
doesn't want to do League, what can we do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have a League
2, but that might be a little weak."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well I can
bring League I suppose."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let's bet on
success."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "My poor dusty
EAOS and RATS suits..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Bring your Rat
or EAOS."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll try to
league it up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Bring the RATS! I
want to ask you all sorts of questions about it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, Eve, you're good in
AEU. Eli will bring damage and I'll try League."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What tier was
that League again?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "2."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is this a crazy
idea?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Night Shule."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm just running to
get my AEU. Double league would not be fun."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I might need
to do some mod swapping, pretty sure I'm gonna want lots of energy, and I think
all I have on this RATs is nanite boost stuff."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...technically
flying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No problem, take
your time. I think Dak needs to set up his suit anyhow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whoa, I have
an empty slot? Weird."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Man, I want one
of those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why the heck
is my RATS at Space Vermin command?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Odd, I've
never qualified to do any of those missions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Finally in the
sector with the station. Remind me to replace the engines as soon as I can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been
received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned
271,918.41 credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Woooah. This is a
cool rift."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Still no criffing ships. And
you think the station inhabitants would clean up the place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Is he still
whining?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Yes. I think he
needs a talking to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, you guys
think that one energy cap and regen will be enough, or should I lose the nanite
boost and projectile boost to bring 2."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably two,
huh? So I can just unload?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Try one of
each."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, why not."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "How rude."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli hung up on me,
after I helped him. I see how it is."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, I'm in a hurry, I
said thanks."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "These are troubling times."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, they are."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do you want me to
switch all these mods out and get moving, or do you want me to chat it up."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's what I
thought ya coat thief."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This may be a silly
question, but is there a downside to using a dual mod? Like will a single
greater mod be more useful than the same one that's part of a dual mod?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Thought maybe the
single ones might be more focused or something?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nah. But doubles are
just handy because...well, double."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So your professional
answer is "all the mods"?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All of them."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sings loudly over his
communicator, without realizing he is holding down the talk button."
[General Communication] James transmits the sound of perfuse swearing, and
banging on docking bay exterior hatches.
[General Communication] James transmits over the sound of his banging madly on
docking bay doors, "I wish a criffing ship would show up."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Even pirates would be welcome,
because I doubt anyone would begrudge a stranded person stealing from pirates."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You better hope they don't
hear you."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I hope they do. I'd like them
to."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Hey pirates! I've got a few
million creds and some gear. Come and get it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Man, what a
duffer."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Pirates have little use for your
alliance currency."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Shame, what a criffing shame.
I'd have great use for one of their ships right about now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright Vernos,
we're heading inside."
[AEU | 4: Sector Status] Frontier Cluster has gone on alert!
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Did it get quiet

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, still."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good that you
responded to it."

Teddy?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is Teddy still out

can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Hello."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, in case you didn'
tnkow. The folks you see with a little tag next to thei name are actually out of
communications range. There's not as many folks around who can hear you as you
might think. Doesn't mean you can't still talk, just didn't want you to think
the entire galaxy was ignoring you."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Can I ignore you,
Eli?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. I guess right
now, there's more folks around then I thought."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I understand that. There
hasn't been any chatter on here for a while, and I wanted to make sure coms
worked on my end."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You may not ignore me
Evenia."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh well. I will
anyway."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Except that you didn't,
making me the victor."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach sighs.

Bastille."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cheers.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I love those."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "A bastille?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's sort of
stronger fighter."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Let's check this cycler out!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah. It's a
fighter-class ship. But it's got a stronger hull. And a full-sized grid."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, sort of?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't have an FTL
drive, though, so it will basically be something I use as a novelty."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Probably for beacons
only."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh that's nice. Real nice."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That sounds nice."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They really are."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'd say it's a little
better than sort of, in my opinion."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I will eventually lose it
in an overdriven beacon."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I will then
flawlessly complete in my capsule."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sounds like a deployment
craft, the type you would take when you have a cary ship. Sounds usefull in
combat situations, especially if you have multiples."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's like...a fighter
with a serious shot of kick ass."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "How many combat points are
required for it?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Actually James,
you're right. They are useful for that."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "1000."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And weapons?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Same as the cadet
fighter."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But with 100%
efficiency. No reduced hull or grid."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But with a bigger grid it
should perform much better."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Cadet fighter? I take
offence to that. I still use my little fighter, even now. Sweet revenge is a
tough little thing."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, do not
understimate the power of the MK III fighter."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That's good to know. I've
never tested the limits on it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I don't mean to
insult them."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I use mine all the time."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I still need training in
combat though."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I don't move fast enough a
lot, and criffing rats can do considerable damage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Woo! That last
beacon gave me just enough to get those new engines I wanted."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I know it's just a cadet's
thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice! Hopefully
you can get it in spite of the adjusted costs due to missing our goals."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "People will take you
on beacons. And help you. You just gotta be respectful. And polite. Or...In my
case. tell them I'll engineer."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Now I'm concerned.
Hopefully."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've done beacons once before,
and found them to be an educational and rewarding experience. That's where I
first learned how combat works in the first place."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. You'll surely
be able to get in on more. Just make sure you pay attention to tactical, because
that's where we call for people."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm sorry for yelling at all
of you earlier, but I've just never been that far from home before, and without
a ship, with nothing familiar to rely upon, it was a great shock. I know I
really screwed myself over with that bus driver, and I plan to appologize to him
if he gives me the chance."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's cool dude. I
mean...what you did isn't cool. but I get how a new place. can put you a bit out
of your mind."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I just need more experience
with things like that."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Just make sure you do
as you say, and apologize to him."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I will."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And...do me a favor.
Please, remember that Ather is a guy."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I will."

[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I doubt he is sorry for what he did.
He is just sorry he is stuck."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Most likely, Aisling.
But we will see if he does apologize or not."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I am sorry for what I did. And
I will appologize."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What in the
hell? Constantine, did you just fucking teleport into the lounge?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Muwahaha!"

tired. I read 280 as 200. I'm not quite there to this battery, haha."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh well! I'm gonna
go out and start hauling again unless we have other plans."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Still want to do
a nest, Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, but I
need a few more minutes. Someone needs to go inform Aisling about the thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries.
About which thing, the QSA delegation?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good, I'm glad
you're reaching out to them."

go meet them all."

Aisling once."

tesla with me Dak."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think we
know exactly what they are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Vernos has
observed that the first one may depend on space combat and industry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We have no
industrial whip at the moment, so we have no idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the second
one may depend on ground and exploration."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We haven't hit
both since my first week on the job."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Industry
helps both of them."

those can be purchased?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Mostly they are just in
some lounges and I think some apartments have them. You can usually get them
from tradesman though."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'll check the lounges when I
get back to old earth."

[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've was able to secure
passage off nuveau quebec, and am now on vesta. Does anyone know if there's an
ATM in a pilot accessible portion of this planet? I need to convert my mutuality
credits, so I can access the ITPN."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There.. should be. but
holy cow? that was fast?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Not really. The trip took over
3 hours, and I paid 3000000 mutuality credits for it, but I'm relieved and glad
to be back in home space."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok.. Hmm."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Didn't find an ATM. You'd
think, seeing that mainly pilots would have the need to transfer money, there
would be one at the spaceport. I guess they never considered that pilots would
arrive without their own ship. Vesta, from what I've seen of the place, is a bit
up in the air when it comes to giving us civilian pilots access to their
planet."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Is there not a circuit on
Vesta?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Plenty of merchant activity
though, I'd say mainly commercial."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He needs credit
conversion to use the circuit Dakhal."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "There's a circuit all right,
but I need to convert my mutuality credits."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ah. I guess I've never paid
attention to any fees I've used in the circuit."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "5000 or 10000 EAOS for main
circuit, and 5000 league for the league circuit, which is the one I presently
need."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hang on. Where are
you? I'll come pick you up."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm already on it,
Eve."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm on vesta, and I'd
appreciate it."

you can't convert credits."

Eli?"

the credit assistant."

to help. At some point, I'll need a lift out to station foxtrot in the arm to
retrieve my other ship. Otherwise, I will have to make that station my primary
base of opperations. Is there any way you could give me a lift out there when
it's convenient?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Where are you now?"
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Old earth."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Okay. Give me a
moment and I'll come get you now."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Thanks a lot. I appreciate
it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "This ship is gonna
hurt like a bitch to upgrade. But I love her already."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sounds expensive, but worth
it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "The hull. Was 750
million. On it's own."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I see you."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All done. I'm
collecting the gemini now."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Eve, what planet is
that Fringe casino on?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um...you're not
talking about L5 station, are you?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No no, the Fringe one."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The one with the lift."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm potentially the
worst person to ask. Since I don't really gamble. Unless it's against you. For
tael."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But you're a Fringer!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Wait, and it has a
lift? I honestly don't have a clue."
[General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Where is this?"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

help rescue pod
--
Star Conquest Help: Rescue Pods
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Space is dangerous. With this in mind, the now-defunct Intersector Shipbuilding
Company developed the rescue pod system. Rescue pods are partly memory metal,
partly inflatable, and can deploy near-instantly in the midst of a starship
losing structural integrity. Electromagnetic manipulators dedicated to the task
will place all crew members swiftly into the pod.
In other words, if your starship is destroyed, you will find yourself in a
rescue pod. Starships also additionally contain a single escape pod which can be
deployed manually. If you wish to manually escape your ship, simply use the
ESCAPE command. Note that this leaves your ship intact but empty; if you wish to
destroy your ship, check the Self-Destruct help file.
Rescue pods are fully automated for your own safety. Using sublight autopilot, a
built-in wormhole drive, and even a rift drive, your pod will transport you to
your home port in the most efficient manner. Using the DESTINATION command, you
can change your pod's destination to another alliance's port, as long as
diplomatic relations allow you to land there.
If you are on the other side of the skim gate from your home port, you will
probably very much want to use this DESTINATION command. Otherwise, your pod
will spend hours crossing the space that the skim gate covers.

Your ship is loaded with nothing with any particular destination at the moment.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

3 jumps, I don't know if I can make it. Let me check to see if I have a charge
booster."

be able to skim and jump to earthgate or something."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But be quick about it."

I'll take the skim without life support, and if necessary use the charge
booster. I'd rather land at earthgate then risk using up all my jumps and
running out of power, because that might end badly."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, Firestorm. Welcome to Accord space."

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a decoy
beacon launcher here.

thing stopping me from just doing it is I didn't know what parts to give to what
orgs."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But this at least gives me
some idea of what to use."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh yeah. So seekers
usually does power. Cats is usually things like processors. Accelloraters
etcetera. Surfers and shit are usually cores or stealth."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That's including
vassals obviously."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought it was more
of a per-beacon thing. That's good to know."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well sometimes it
changes around a bit. But...to be blunt. as long as a beacon goes up. I don't
give a damn. If orgs didn't leave enough parts. that's their problem. If you
need to. use that message top from libs you guys have aboard one of your ships."

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a personal hoverpallet, and Chuck
the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest,
and down.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
c/$vxI4i}!e'4\zR$>1=.|(`aE#=NQM'6"L'h\YE
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

currently.. just not to leave."

true. But I was going to make you an offer. Because I am a nice person."

it! It's a trap!"

I am innocent and therefore have done nothing but nice things to you Eve."

back."

probably got the parts for an accelerator."

annoying it is to be restricted by stupid stations that are down."

morningstar is a wasp carrier. So rather than all doing the beacon from the main

and then 3 wasps, which are like little fighters."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

[MTTS] Ulias: Hahaha, those last two announcements together, almost made me spit
cola on my computer.
[MTTS] something: Poor sad fringers.
[MTTS] andawn: Really liking how these are written.
[MTTS] alc_71: These files are very detailed. I love it.
[MTTS] andawn: How much would say, a league pilot, know about fringe or AEU
polotics?
[MTTS] canpher: I'm going to have to hit google hard later since I'm not very
smart.
[MTTS] something: I'm guessing a pilot could find a lot of this out if they
really wanted to?
[MTTS] Squidmind: That's a difficult question to answer due to the nature of
what you're asking.  How much would a German citizen know about Australian
politics?
[MTTS] andawn: But how much, say, would the fringe dictatorship sensor
information on the other alliance's polaticks systems.
[MTTS] something: I mean, if they're a well informed person who cares about
politics.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, if someone actually took the effort to find it out, they
could easily learn about the intricacies of how the governments of the other
alliances worked.
[MTTS] alc_71: I am guessing it would depend on the interest of each individual
pilot. Some are just not into politics and so would maybe only know what they
have to know about their own politics.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The average non-pilot probably doesn't know much about the
other alliances at all since they have no contact with them.
[MTTS] canpher: I'm probably only going to really look into the bits that align
with my character's outlook.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Civilian pilots, members of the governments, and people who
have reason to interact with the other alliances, would be the ones who'd have
reason to gain the knowledge.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[MTTS] andawn: Thank you. I just wanted to know how much i'd be allowd to bring
this up in rollplay, if at all, due to sensorship and the like.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "When are most of
these out of comms people due to return?"
[MTTS] andawn: Also, a completely unrelated question somewhat, how much does the
fringe government sensor the media?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think the Feng
Wo trip should return tomorrow or Saturday."
[MTTS] Squidmind: Before becoming a civilian pilot the average person would know
who the president of the League/AEU was and that the Fringe was led by a
military dictator, but beyond that they probably wouldn't know, care, or have
reason to find out - regardless of alliance.
[MTTS] something: Would the trend set by Trump in the real world of people
noticing politics because of the ridiculousness involved be applicable to the
AEU? Or does the lack of information technologies make it less of a conversation
point.
[MTTS] andawn: I did notice a similarity betweene best and trump. I did have a
bit of a chuckle about that.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Even in the real world there is a LOT of support for current
American policies.  But to answer your question the majority of the AEU
population voted for the National Patriots and they were fairly clear on what
they would do once in power.
[MTTS] andawn: I think it would be interesting if the election speeches were on
the holovids.

Notice from the Space Defense Captain: Pilots, as we enter the last ten days of
the term, I wanted to congratulate everyone for doing a great job. If my
accounting is accurate, we only lost three ships this term, and only two of
those were lost in combat. Since those losses, we've done a great job responding
to sector alerts, and we even responded to an attack on Accord command --
something I hope they'll remember about us, regardless of what else may happen.
We've also been putting up great beacon numbers. It has been a while since the
last update, but I want to say that about 45% of the beacons done this term have
been done on AEU ships, which is a higher number than I've ever seen. Part of
this may be due to the extended absence of other pilots, but the work we've done
is still nothing to sneeze at. Finally, I'd like to thank the new pilots for
their help in keeping our home sectors free of RATs as much as possible.
Celebrate our collective success by doing a fighter beacon or two in these last
few conquests of the term -- remember that troubled times are ahead, and keeping
our skills sharp may help us all in the long run. [19:55 10 August 2317 GST]

[Starship "Striking Distance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

the words "Public Access HV."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey turns to the camera, eyes
rimmed in red. "Greetings once again citizens of the Union, and of the galaxy."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli is plain and has a slightly pudgy build,
fair skin, grey eyes, and mid-back length mirror finish chrome hair and he
stands about five feet and ten inches tall and looks to be in his late twenties.
He is wearing a long white coat, a long-sleeved shirt of steel gray synthcotton,
a pair of close-fitting steel gray synthcotton pants, and a pair of black
synthleather ship boots.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Tonights broadcast
will be a little different, as you can see. We are abord my transport Grey Sky."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli gestures at the planet of New earth, visible
through the viewport.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I almost thought of
calling off this broadcast tonight, after the tragic events of today. There are
some that may say that I should have. Make no mistake, that we do what we do
tonight, with a heavy heart indeed."
You notice that your hair is now mid-back length.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The tragic bombing
of my hometown, is something that will be forever burned into my memory. Those
that have done this terrible thing, have done so out of desperation. A
desperation that so many of us have felt lately. I do not condone their actions,
but I understand them."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I have decided to
move forward, with something we have been planning for oever a week now, in the
hopes that it will prevent others from feeling that they need to act in similar
ways."

us fear will lead to total disaster. Our words have not changed anything,
however and so it is time that instead, we act."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I have more important things to send

From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "We have attempted to
use reason to reach our government. And instead of responding with their own
logical arguments, they have chosen instead to drag our names through the mud,
and to use deception and manipulation against what we have to say."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "This transport, the
Grey sky, has survived many things. Outsiders, IFS, pirates. She has travelled
into deep space to bring home valuable resources for the alliance. She even once
assisted in relieve a drought on the planet of Hyperion."

From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances down at his
gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli take a deep breath, and lets it out slowly,
the ripples on his skin gorwing slower as he speaks. "I am, truthfully at a loss
for what else to say. I can only hope that by doing what we will do tonight,
will be the start to ending all of this madness.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "And so, it is with
htis, that we call for a resource strike. We call for all Union pilots to join
us in this. We shall continue to divert patrols, keep space clear of RATS and
their nests, and defend against all threats, but we will no longer bring
resoruces in. We can not fund an alliance in it's endeavor to destroy itself."

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

* United Freight d'Intsec Mystified After AEU Pilots Target Medium Transports
for Self-Destruction: "Perhaps We Should Reconsider Doing Business with the AEU
Corps Given Current Political Climate" [11 August 2317] (DNA)

[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Where's this statement,
Vernos?"
You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Right here in my hands."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well, send me a copy."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "And what's that tabloid
headline about?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I knew we should have used
alliance ships."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Still can."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Why? It's done whatever you've
intended, more or less."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It wasn't supposed to
be an attack on United Freight. We went with transports as a symbol of
indsutry."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one said you
can't sacrifice more resource-gathering ships. Asteroid haulers are
alliance-exclusive."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Blow up a few cruisers or
gunships."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "That's dumb."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Warships? Really?"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I already told
Eli ththe inadvisability and general stupidity of blowing up warships."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We need those in case
there's an attack, that's why that wasnt' already done."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't be so
cavalier in wasting ships that could be potentially used to fight off Outsider
and IFS invasions."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well a cruiser costs the
alliance, what amount of credits to produce?"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well a cruiser
blown up is one less cruiser that could defend humanity."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Are you insane?"
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Vernos?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Can I get half
credit, the logic is not flawed."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Well, I'm not really surprised
that you're not getting it. You want the union to not withdraw from Accord,
saying that Accord will aid in the defense, yet go blow up the defense ship.
Dumb."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It costs them a shit
ton of credits to produce."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The
logic is 100% flawed only because you want to use the cost of production to take
away something from defense."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I originally thought to
do just that, but I can't very well stand and say we need to defend humanity and
then blow up a ship that does just that."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright, fair point."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I was thinking cost of
production."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli and I
discussed what ships would be best to blow up on several occasions. I privately
worried that United would probably lash out, but I was hoping that they would be
understanding about why we were doing it. Apparently, I've been right all along,
and corporations really do only care more about filling their credit accounts
more than they do about projects for hope."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I don't agree with you, well,
somewhat. They're planning to stop working with the union with the current
political climate and that's not something Best can ignore. You'll achieve the
same results with it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I was thinking
something simlar, but couldn't think of a good way to put it into words. My mind
is fried after today."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Won't matter
for the immediate future regardless. We're not intending to bring in any
resources for the time being."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Definitely. You won't need the
ships as long as Best's over there anyway. So it doesn't really matter."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And it's not
like we could go to them before hand and say "yo we're planning to do this."
They would've probably tried to score points and ratted us out."
[General Communication] Voice of the Corps Vernos Bailey transmits, "And I back
my pilot corps and refuse to ask them to do so."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like I said,
corporations care about their own interests and nothing else."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Of course."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway, if it
will help United cool their balls, I'm sure we could blow up hardened asteroid
haulers so that they don't keep their panties in a twist."
Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has

[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You wasteful people."
n
You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.
[General Communication] Corporate Prime Administrator Jean Poutine transmits,
"One cannot spend hope, Monsieur Jammoa."
[General Communication] Voice of the Corps Vernos Bailey transmits, "Actually
VET as you again promote fake news, I joined on my own free will and had only
one concern which was establishing a fund to aid Hyperion."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One can
understand the motivations behind all of this, and should have expected that
appropriate reparations could've been made had the efforts were supported by the
corporation whose ships had to be destroyed in order to make the statement as
effective as possible."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Blah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Vernos Bailey transmits,
"Fucking piece of shit best ass kissing news organizations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin sighs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm so fucking drained
from all of thiso."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. yeah, exactly, I
can't even talk right."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. One thing is for
sure. The folks who have been gone are going to have a lot of headlines to read
when they get back, I suppose."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Woo?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You mean a lot of
misinformation?"
[MTTS] kayden has joined the channel.
[MTTS] kayden: I feel like I connect to this game daily and its a bad repeat of
real life where the news twists and contorts things worst that fox news to
promote an agenda.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Area Player Calls Host Headline Writing 'Bad'
[MTTS] usfolks: Dying from laughter...
[MTTS] kayden: Me too.
[MTTS] Ulias: Hahahahahah.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Though, we're not sure what you mean by 'promoting an agenda.'
[MTTS] kayden: I do feel like its a bad repeat of fox news or cnn some days
though.
[MTTS] usfolks: Space opera at its best.
[MTTS] kayden: Eh the staff arent really promoting an agenda its more of an
comparing real life to the game.
[MTTS] Squidmind: But... You just said that we're trying to promote an agenda...
[General Communication] Cheri first, think later, it's way less stressful
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean, act first think
later."
[MTTS] kayden: Area player retracts statement, calls comparsion a terrible
example.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, I don't know I
kinda like the first way better."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I don't even know what you
mean."
[MTTS] kayden: I guess I just wish I did not connect to escape the current real
world shit storm only to have to roleplay in a in character shit storm.
[MTTS] usfolks: We all chose our roles and make our decisions. They haven't been
thrust upon us.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think I just misheard
something, is all."
[MTTS] kanamoto: This is one of those classic cases of 'actions have
consequences'
[MTTS] usfolks: Kanamoto said it more siccinctly than I did, but the point is,
you choose your alliance, you choose what your character does, you choose how
you react to others, you choose how you deal with consequences for things you
did or failed to do. If you have a "shit storm" it's one you built for your
character.
[MTTS] usfolks: Also I can't type today. Succinctly is the word.
[MTTS] kayden: I guess.
[MTTS] Ulias: Fully embrace the shitstorm, revel in it. Consequences are what
makes Sc great. And be comforted by the fact that there are actions you can take
in SC that you can not in real life.
[MTTS] usfolks: Exactly Ulias.
[MTTS] kayden: Some days I do.
[MTTS] usfolks: Other days when you feel you can't, take a break. When you get
too close to your char and the game isn't enjoyable, it's time to take a step
back.
[MTTS] kayden: I'll use the AEU plot as an example. There are some days I hate
the fuck out of it and then others its like this is sort of fun.
[MTTS] usfolks: You chose to create a character in the AEU. If you wanted a
quiet existence in the game, that's the alliance with the least chance of that
happening.
[MTTS] kayden: Seriously though that headline thing here on mtts was epic,
squidmind.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Please get back in character.
[MTTS] kayden: Sure thing.
[MTTS] atherj: I don't suppose this would be the time to ask for a "help
Mutuality politics" file then? Oh well!
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Org, don't even say the
words "next broadcast" right now though."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Next broadcast?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Too late."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Urmom?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Next broadcast: Rogue Ace Pilot
Ather Jammoa eats terrible food that is not even fit for felo consumption."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like...urmom."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Indeed."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Knowing Ather he'd broadcast
his lizard eating felo on the holovid."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Been there,
done that."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity. What the hell
sort of conversation did I wake up to?"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Give me a
challenge."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Enter the competitive tea
drinking championships."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Is that challenging?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It would be for me, I
fucking hate tea."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eh I have a challenge for
Ather."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "He can not say urmom for a
week."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Too easy."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "A month then?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "He'd do it, just to
prove that he could."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I doubt his ability not to say
urmom."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Tea is good but not as good
as coffee."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What do you say Ather, can you
do it?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Those competitive tea
drinkers are hardcore."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Downing boiling hot
tea, like it's a shot of vodka."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "If Ather enters is that
cheating since he is part drone?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I do that with
coffee, quite regularly."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've said this before,
that you should enter Evenia."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But...It's tea!"
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "... Ten headlines?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Was it ten."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I lost count."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Live
Long And Prosper."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I guess
Shule and I aren't going to be rogued."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I
suppose not. I guess that's a good thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I appearently can do
no wrong even when I try to support you all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That headline
was actually pretty hilarious."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean it's not,
but we'll be laughing about it months from now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. what
would it say if all the pilots were rogued."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I just look like a
giant asshole to everyone outside of the AEU."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I need a fucking
vacation."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or even a regular one."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Have to find someone to fuck first
yes?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Indeed Ash, indeed."
[General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Live
Long And Prosper to AFW Command: Q 274 UP <END>"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So if I'm not
getting rogued or anything I'll try to negotiate a new QSA treaty. Do I make
those arrangements with Aisling, or with someone else?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aisling is
there liaison, yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. I
wasn't sure, what with the weird titles they give themselves out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Should I run for
voice again or step away?"
[General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Outgoing QE message from AFW
Command to Live Long And Prosper: NO <END>"
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "No what?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They asked if 270 was
up."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They asked if 274 was up."
[General Communication] A robotic voice says, "QE message transfer to Live Long
And Prosper complete."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking I
might run."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though Eli told
me you confirmed that the dissidents can still hold office."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So we might not
be short of more experienced people."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Best's Man Vernos Bailey transmits, "They can
but they face extreme skepticism from the government."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That's if they even
want to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] SPCF Member Vernos Bailey transmits, "That
motherfucker gets on my nerves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's SPCF?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Society for
the Protection of Felo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well if you run and
I run you'll get it hands down constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you
might be right, even though I do think you've been doing a good job."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'd like to go
forward for a second term but yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I suppose
you can see how people would feel about it."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained
1,643,750.00 credits from a xenology submission.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I know the answer
already."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my main
concern is that they're using you and you're making headlines for the wrong
reasons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I know
you're mad about it but the best move might be to just stop."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It resembers the one
that Aisling delivered."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has
been posted under "AEU."
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we can
still buy medium transports."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So there's
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. well That's good, 
for now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh Eli, I meant
to ask you, is it okay to work for Tesla?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I... I don't know?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It might be ok, since it
goes through the Teslabucks system. We're awarded indsutry points for them, but
I think the metals and stuff are probably distrubted through the Accord.. You
could try writing tot he EAOS about it, or I can if you want."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can ask."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Plus you get ground for
it too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, and I've
been wanting to work on my ground."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assume GMG is
okay, right? There's no industry component to that, is there?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah GMG is fine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you get
points from GMG, or are the special blueprints the only reward?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Exploration points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And I think a little
ground."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And parts, all the
parts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've just been informed
that GMG is the shit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It gives you all of the
things, except the industry things, thus making it "the shit""
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh, I gotta get
out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I already hate this, I
hated it before we even started it. I love brining in industry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, me too. I
don't think we can back down now, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh no, I'm not talking
about backing down. Just saying that I hate it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacon?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd say yes.
Except...we have a slight problem, like that vents problem a while ago."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's the problem?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "BACON!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "The one where--well,
it speaks for itself."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My mind is racing."
[General Communication] Eli Grey assaults your ears with a burst of static and
screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "BIG HARRY'S MONKEY
WAFFLE HOUSE."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ow sanity!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...If it helps,
eli is saying how he...doesn't want bacon from the vents."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ohh, I get it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're talking the problem
from after the vents."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. That problem."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One of the classic
problems."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "At one stage, he also
thought vartija was...Ather."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could see it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey Constantine?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes! I'm here."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Get your butt over to
the torus."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Dock alpha."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "On my way."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well I'm here but I don't
see anything."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole
drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, ")h."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I always give cadets
a fair shot, but..."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Before I take a nap,
every station is up, including 285, and the bubble. The orion salvage station
will go down in like 15 hours. I did the best I could to build all the things.
Only thing that's down in orion is the weather station."

That's the important part."

put up, correct?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I started to. Then I
had a couple issues. I'd asked Nicolette to help. But...I'm not sure how that
went."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'll mess with that
sometime soon. I am not going back into the rift just now."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sorry Mel. But all in
all...I think all the stations were a success. Joel and Morris. I ended up
needing a key to hanging ten. and the seekers beacon ship. I will send them back
if you like."

or I'da sent ya one. So keep it."

get you one."

feel better by stating that if you're tired, make sure I have parts on joyride
who is depressingly empty, and I'll put up the orion salvage later."

[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "It is hard to imagine."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There's like...one
part on there, I swear. I had to raid and steal and scrape for parts from
everywhere."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Our methods
were perhaps extreme, but extreme methods are needed to combat extreme
situations. All you all pretty much know are the media spins, so it's
unsurprising the way you're reacting. Eli can explain it if he wants to, I am
personally just waiting at the moment."

off your noses to spite your faces."

deal with them accordingly!"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyway,
remember what they say about assumptions and the first three letters of the word
or some such! The media is doing a great job at it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So is the spaceport closed
over there?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh oh. Felo. That
reminds me. Morris. I found your elusive mean talking felo. I have been keeping
them breeding on a little ship so that you could choose a kitten when you
return."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I have not
tried to land at Hyperion due to the current situation in Jacktown."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. Thank you Eve. If you're
goin to bed, just holler at me when you're up."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The spaceport
should be far enough away to be mostly uneffected, that idiot sanctuary, too.
Who can know, though?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm taking a nap for
a bit but yeah. I will. Currently they're all adults. But I did it this way so
you could pick a kitten. Rather than me just giving one tonic."

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the

a special privilege to be able to purchase. How much intelligence does tht

A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's neck.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We had to do
something, negotiations will be over in like, less than two weeks."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wait
you had to carelessly blow up a special ship which enables us to perform work
which isn't even built by the AEU and at the expense of the rest of us?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The
transports are a symbol, and once they are purchased from United Freight, they
belong to the Union. Blowing them up costs the alliance a lot of capital."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A strike
isn't supposed to be a good thing."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It
obviously has and shows that we're um not very rational and well you can strike
if you want but you don't have to destroy future prospects. We already have
enough problems don't you think?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The goal was
not to upset United Freight. The fact that they are upset doesn't really make
sense[considering that it cost them nothing, |nd when the strike is over they
will just sell more transports. If anyt'ing they should have used it as an
advertisement for how good their ships are. We would not have chosen those ships
if they weren't hte best for resource management."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Look, I ended
up crying on the fucking air when mine blew. It's not something I did on a whim,
or without caring."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
don't view it that way at all. It's shoing disrespect for the privilege of being
able to purchase a starship which we cannot obtain from any other source for the
purpose it is inteded for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And you'don't
find that as incentive for the government to end the strike?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We can still
purchase transports by the way. You talk as though they aren't selling them to
us anymore."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
don't know but I would not support anything like that. You can choose not to
work but destruciton of equipment and otherwise is jsut jeopardizing us
particularly that others already don't have a high regard for oru Corps."

looked upon very sternly."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Stupid."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Jsut totally stupid."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline sighs softly. "I don't know if
arguing is getting us anywhere."
Lily says to you, "I hope you didn't do that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I won't hate you for it but you know my

A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's fine,
she has a right to feel the way she wants to about it I guess, I just don't
really appreciate being called stup.d because something unforseen happened.
Particularly by someone who was off on a trip while this was going on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We were being

Shule frowns sadly, "We were not being heard."

difficult position over actions which I didn't participate in as well."

You say, "No, doing nothing digs us into a deeper hole."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well destorying ships is stupidity."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Destroying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You knew what
was going on when you left. It's fine that you wanted to [o, but being upset
because you didn't have a say in something while you were not here doesn't make
sense to me. YOu didn't hear me jumping everyone's ass for voting for Best while
I was gone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok I'm sure it won't be long and we'll
all have to hand in our licenses anyway."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're surely not proving much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We would have
waited until you all got back to do anything, but time is running o)t."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's like everybody on that shp kept
referring to the AEU over and over again as essentially being wreckless and
stupid. This jsut proves it mroeso."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Moreso."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't
think you were, that was more referring to being called stupid."

this."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh no? I asked a question this
mornin."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You did more than ask
questions."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've been tryin to get some
clarification and asked if they weren't hurtin themselves more than the alliance
and nobody answered."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Then offered to rent out
your transport?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "And said that they were cutting
off their nose to spite their face?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So did Eve. Think bout it. 100
mill an hour? Who's gonna pay that. It was a joke and I wouldn't do it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I asked Joel. I didn't say I
disagreed."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Blowing up their transports was
stupid."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What we do to
ourselves is irrelevant if the alliance doesn't remain in the Accord. You
fferring to rent out your transport was honestly a blatent insult to what we
were trying to accomplish. We, that is to say, those of us who were here were
already prepared for the potential ramifications, but in this case, if the
strike manages to succeed, those ramifications are worth whatever ends up
happening to us."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Actually...It was ted
that said he'd rent his for 5 tael."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok, yeah, sorry. Ted."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "So you both offered then."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And Ather, I get that. I was
askin questions and no one was answerin. Plus, no I wouldn't really rent out the
transport. It wasn't an offer, it was a joke."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Who in their right mind would
pay that much to rent a transport?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Probably not the best time
to be joking with what they are dealing with."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, you got a point. But I
kept askin questions and nobody had answers...humor's kinda my...fallback."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Then you wait until people
aren't busy."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's just gonna cause
headlines that downplay what they are trying to do. Which, it did."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nobody was busy Joel."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "The galaxy doesn't revolve
around your curiousity."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling, you
are certainly entitled to your opinion. However, a firm statement needed to be
made about our refusal to gather resources for our alliance in the immediate
future. If that statement happened to cost our alliance several billion credits
in the process in order to start driving the point home, we will do what we
must."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anyway, that's my view. I
am done."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. First, my apologies to the
AEU pilots. I actually totally agree with what you're doin...I told ya awhile
back that you needed to do somethin...I'm proud of ya. No jokin here. And if
somebody needed to borrow a ship from me, not havin to do with this...I'd never
charge for it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd hope folks know me better
than that, but I guess not."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And if I didn't agree, would I
have been askin bout that station stuff to be sure?"
[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yo."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Well my opinion is that gummy
bears are an excellent pancake topping."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I disagree and will protest
this."

voicemail Aisling?"
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I did."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I am relieved."

transmits, "Wait what did you voice mail her about Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just what I
*ad said earlier, about asking her to possibly give you guys some pointers with
how to deal with the council."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Oh, ok, thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Since, I
honestly have no idea. She would know much better than m*."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Call now and order your very
own."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't believe we were
able to get our hands on these."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "For the AEU pilots who plan to be
delegates for this meeting with Council, I will be on Old Earth. I will be
acting as your transport across Skim to Helios."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Meeting is just within an hour."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "It's a lovely item we have
here."

lovely item."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I still loved it when
the guy said that about not bein$ able to believe they got their hands on these,
and it was a pair of light green AEU bikini panites."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass
sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit
on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged.
Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is
heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for
extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways
framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the
northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the
Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway
reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked
'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south,
another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The augmented explorer "Oracle", the three-person clipper "Firestorm", and the
two-person Accord gemini "Family Jewels" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a personal hoverpallet, and Chuck
the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest,
and down.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You both can disagree though and take it in
any direction you want but if we mention what we're losing, they will just look

Dissident nods.

thing."

Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "And we can't make a stupid deal
either that won't fall through."
[MTTS] Squidmind: We aren't intentionally stopping anything, we're having the
game world react to what's being done!
[MTTS] Ulias: Everyday, I wake up just waiting to see what crazy headlines are
coming next.
Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods. "This is true, but since the
government clearly doesn't care..."

statement against any future military acitons towards them."

You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is very important."
[MTTS] usfolks: Of, not if.
[MTTS] Ulias: I suppose a better way to say it, is just that I love how the AEU
pilots just can't get a win, not that the Squidmind is doing it specifically.

set into the walls, giving a clear view of both the original station, now
completely renovated and fixed to the north, and of the cylindrical

and a large, finely polished black ebony table in the center with numerous
chairs pulled up to it. The colors of the Mutuality are displayed in the bands
of red and black running along the dark metal walls, and in the black and red

willing to renegotiate the agreement we had with your alliance prior to it
ending just as we did with the others, even with your increased hostility
towards us. Your government declined to do so and the agreement ended.  You
pilots then demanded we give you a free extension to skim usage until you were
willing to enter into negotiations with us and when we rejected that ridiculous
demand you made another one: that we meet with representatives immediately.  We
have tried to meet you halfway here, and at every step you have thrown our good
will into our faces, as you have repeatedly over the past trade cycle.  What
exactly are you trying to accomplish here?  Is this your best, or are you merely
doing his work?"

demanded we come here at this time with no real preparation.  You are now saying
that any agreement we make here has no guarantee of being upheld by your
government, but would be upheld by us.  This is not a negotiating tactic that
engenders a desire for us to continue negotiating."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How can we satisfy you then? What would
enable you to be comfortatle that we could follow through though?"
Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "By telling us how you actually plan to follow
through."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I personally will do whatever it takes
to go to our Government if it risks my license to do so. What happens is
unacceptable and if I can do anything about it it will never happen again."

Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "You must either convince us the government will
uphold your agreement, or make an agreement you will be able to uphold in spite
of your government."

whatever you want us to' you people keep saying has no meaning."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I wish I could offer you the tech you want

desist with any future encroachment into Mutuality territories."
Councilman Brandon Ryland asks, "So your offer is that the AEU will not attack
us?"
Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "What? What is tech we want? Did we say we want
tech?"

otherwise to demand that they cease and desist with any future encroachment into
Mutuality Territories."

access, you will ask government not to attack us?"

skims and in return you will perhaps ineffectually demand that your government
not attack us."

mutuality being attaked. If the mutuality is attacked on this side of the skims,

defend you on either side of the skims. Without skim acess, that limits our

Lifting up her head, Evangeline says, "If we traded with you, would that
accomplish something? Perhaps something you need. We can't trade anything
technology wise and I know I know... you didn't say tech..." She stares at Lily,
eyes widening as she turns back to Aleksei. "We could give you supplies you
need. Perhaps medical. Something that you can use."
Councilman Aleksei Frolov asks, "Perhaps it would. Perhaps it would not. What is
offer?"
Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I want to give you medical supplies
to help in mutuality space. We can trade them to you for use of your skims. It
is a safer bet than what we were talking about with the almost war. Plus, it
would help you."
Councilman Aleksei Frolov says, "Better supplies than what EAOS and League and
Fringe will be trading to us, or that we can produce ourselves? We are not
living in isolated primitive space huts."
Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "So far you have offered to do things you would
do regardless of any agreement, things you wouldn't do regardless of any
agreement, told us that if your alliance declares war on us that you would
graciously allow us to have the agreement become null and void, and now you
offer us basic medical supplies as if we are in desperate need of help?  This
isn't a negotiation, this is a farce."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well restoring trade with us would
certainly bring you more of an opportunity of commerce???"
Councilman Brandon Ryland says, "That would be better for you, not us."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
"All right then."

Councilman Aleksei Frolov exclaims, "Restoring trade? You have had GRAND CYCLES
to do that already! That came with diplomatic relations you made no serious
attempt at restoring! Now you attempt to attach accelerator access to it!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No sir was just an offer that if our goods
were beneficial to you, the it could be amended to the offer."
Chairwoman Candida Doyle helps herself to a white index card from a compact hip

to calm down, she says, "It's fine Eli. Truly. Just... I was so embarrassed, and
panicked. And they called on me to speak and I don't speak politics well. If it
had been art, I would have been all for it, but it was politics. Negociations. I
would have given them the fucking red sea if they'd asked of me. I would have
given it to them just so they wouldn't ever call on me again. Ever."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,

they could have cared less but you all had to learn for yourselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well we don't
have much to really offer them, not really. We're the ones that want access so
they seem to hold the cards there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "We don't have shit to offer them. If we did we would have gone in
there prepared, but as it stands, I can't shut up now. Goddess Evangeline shut

direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

Between the windows on each side of this section of corridor are two arches
perhaps twenty feet high, each one containing a small green tree with lacy
leaves. The trees grow from beneath the floor, their slender, dark brown trunks
emerging from decorative circular grates. While most of the illumination here is
provided by the lighted walls, tiny star-like lights twinkle from the boughs of
the trees. Three doorways on the outer side of the corridor lead to small shops,
one selling souvenirs, the second identified by a brightly lit twinkling sign as
'Holiday Ornamentation,' and the third named 'The Ontological Felo,' which has
articles of oddly shaped clothing in a small display window next to the doorway.

Tall, fragile trees perhaps a hundred feet high grow around the walls of the
Arboretum, their thin boughs of delicate green leaves directed upward in
graceful curves and adorned with tiny, twinkling white lights. Overhead is a
large transparent dome braced with radial plasteel beams, the blackness of space
beyond softened by the uppermost branches of the trees. The floor is paved with
white, silver-laced marble, and in the center of it is another tree, more
substantial than the others and bearing oddly shaped, unpickable red fruit. This
tree is surrounded by masses of exotic flora whose fragrant blossoms scent the
air nearby, with a padded bench encircling the whole arrangement. A small dome
is off to one side, containing a plant that does not look at all terrestrial.
Though some people undoubtedly come here to enjoy the atmosphere, others come to
browse the shops nearby, including a small flower shop and a store with a sign
over the entrance, reading 'Writables.' In addition, a green Scribner's cookie
cart has been set up near the entrance, filling the air with the aroma of
freshly baked sugar cookies.

upgrade is needed to install the Torus NDB?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The short-range or
long-range?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...they call it standard."
[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I have the Standard in the
gemini, but it also hits the Torus. I meant the long range but perhaps that is
the problem."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, you've gotta have
exploration-grade sensors for that one."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.
You see a large leather chair, an improved temporary wormhole drive, and an
improved temporary wormhole drive here.

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am not sure if it will
work out but, let's try the Mutey 4 in case we need some backup reps."

You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK."
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
7Ck`m8fc!CF+[Ccz_Ix_0Y"%y*qu%=N$V';f\FCj
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has

From a phone-based holoemitter: The image flashes white, and the words
"COMPETITIVE TEA-DRINKING 2310 INTERPLANETARY CHAMPIONSHIP" appear as the view
rotates rapidly around a large stadium.
From a phone-based holoemitter: A sports commentator says, "Hello! And welcome
to the Competitive Tea-Drinking Interplanetary Championship! Tonight's match,
the FINAL match, is between New Earth veteran Lynx Forrest and a newcomer from
Ars Magna, Woodward Whittaker Derringer."
From a phone-based holoemitter: The crowd filling the stadium cheers wildly as
the commentator continues. "Forrest has had a hard season, and for a time it was
far from a sure thing that he would ever make it this far!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: "But he's here tonight, and facing off against
rookie Derringer, who has come out of NOWHERE to take the sport by storm this
season!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: "Forrest is still the favorite to take the
championship title tonight, but as they say, folks, the truth is in the tea! And
it looks like we're about ready for the first cup of the night!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: The view abruptly zooms into the middle of the
field, where a small round table is set up, quaint dark wooden chairs in place,
and its surface decorated with a pair of doilies. Two impeccably-dressed men are
just now placing trays and tea services next to each of the competitors.
From a phone-based holoemitter: "The competitors' seconds are pouring the first
cup. It looks like veteran Forrest hopes to start simple but win over the judges
with superior technique, as he's chosen a classic lemon tea for his first cup."
From a phone-based holoemitter: "Newcomer Derringer has chosen a rather more
daring approach with a cup of orange tea. And he's... not taking any sugars!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: You watch Forrest accept a cube of sugar from
his second with a smile. The commentator says, "Forrest accepts one sugar... and
we're off!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: The two men eye each other intently as they
carefully swirl their steaming cups of tea.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Time passes.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Forrest takes the first sip.
From a phone-based holoemitter: "First blood!" shouts the commentator. "Forrest
has taken a sip of his piping hot beverage without betraying the slightest
reaction! Derringer will have to catch up fast if he hopes to stay competitive!"

be friends."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know all
the specifics of the Tandem Pact agreement, but ti's not quite the same thing."

made of."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Friends are a good thing to
have. I wish you both the best of luck in your friendship endeavor."
[General Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not completely
familiar with all the terms of the Tandem Pact, but if they join, doesn't that
mean they'll have to stop attacking alliance space?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't think Kelsey's
prepared to do what it would take for he and myself to begin a road to
friendship."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if
I fully understand the ramifications of them entering the tandem pact."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hate to say
it, but if they would let Kelsey in, I don't know if we should have dealings
with the Mutuality."
[General Communication] Mister Kelsey transmits, "My fleet will be at the
disposal of the Tandem Pact to keep the peace. In this role, they will not be
aggressors. However, we are free to pursue our usual hobbies otherwise."

longer being a target."

organization that's allied with us, but still attack us. Great diplomacy skills

room for that ya know."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Definitely."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh, the AEU
fleet encroaching on Mutuality space, the Mutuality enlisting pirates to defend
its space. This all smells like war."

our best combat pilots.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

and ain't really got a place to put it."

Constantine later. Morris."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So my
understanding is that the Tandem Pact is what we think of as the Mutuality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that
correct?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Tandem pact is a
larger group of spacers that the Mutuality is a part of."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli, I said hi to
crawly for ya."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Good kid/ Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, I am a good
kid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's
probably better to think of the tandem pact as the unreg version of the Accord;
gathering a bunch of unreg factions into a sort of group that achieves whatever
goals they're shooting for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well the reason
I asked is that I was wondering if we have to worry about anything we might give
to the Mutuality in exchange for QSA access being made available to pirates."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I don't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well,
I mean, the QSA is going to be available for the pirates whether we like it or
not."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not
sure what you mean? We don't control the QSA and pirates have always had
access."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "So,
I'm not sure what you mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not really
talking about access to the qsa."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm talking
about the deal we strike with the mutuality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Then what are you talking about?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
I don't know what you mean either?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll presumably
have to give them something for access."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Will that thing
be available to pirates?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I'm trying to fix that. Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It
always has."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I don't know, they can fly our ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I'm not
talking about availability of the QSA."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
suppose that depends. Evangeline, flying our ships has nothing to do with this
whatsoever. They're fucking pirates. They fucking stole them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm talking
about avaiability of whatever we give them, for our own access."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Not that, I mean they can in essence fly our ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I know that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Constantine, as for what we give them, you could always stipulate in your terms
that what we give is for the -Mutuality- only."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But
handle that on a case-by-case basis. See what they want first."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh
yes I see what Constantine is getting at. Good point and I agree with Ather."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I guess the
question would be can we trust them to stick to that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Probably not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know,
personally I'd be uncomfortable trading away any kind of military tech now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "As I'm sure the
government would."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "We
will not trade away any military tech to the Mutuality regardless."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
1 right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"That's a very raw deal for us."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Eli are you around?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I'm not
even sure what is on the table. Maybe Vernos needs to ask what the terms of the
deal were last time."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No
QSA access is worth giving them military technology. Is that what they were
wanting for QSA access in the last negotiation?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No
they just wanted the AEU not to Attack them."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been
received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned
1,088,148.16 credits.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They
were not asking for any tech and we did bring it up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
mean, we can give assurances of not attacking them when it comes to civilian
pilots, but not sure what we could do regarding the navy at this time."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not a bad roid."
[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why
the fuck would you offer them technology?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know
what we would or wouldn't offer them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I wrote an apology to the council at any rate and a letter to andre
lambeth asking a question I hope will be considered."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli had said
they were interested in the revo or the jackrabbit, but also noted that the
government would never allow that."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hi."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes
I agree but we can firmly request that our Navy not attack under non-aggressive

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli,
when I brought up Tech, they said they weren't asking for tech."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't
offer them technology, for sure. Lily, you can firmly request that they change
the name of the color blue to green. However, at this time, that request will
probably get filed into the same deep dark location which never gets looked at."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh
for real."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah? Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "In
the very least, we are affirming to the 9th that we don't support actions of
hostility on the part of the aEU Navy towards them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That
was when we had a non-aggression pact. Everyone is able to buy the revo and the
jackrabbit at non-aggression pact levels. We are not negotiating for a
Non-aggression pact, though. We are negotiating for QSA access. Don't forget, it
was -them- who dissolved the non-aggression pact. The QSA access is a completely
separate entity, not to be confused with it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay, that
clears things up. So this is far lower level than any kind of deal that would
affect availability of technology."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes.
Technolgoy is completely off the table for this negotiation. Don't bring it up."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We'd
only ever consider Tech only if there was a better relationship going forward
and nothing less."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do
what you can with that moron Vernos about trying to coordinate with the
government to receive assurances that the AEU won't create any hostile
situations against the Mutuality without provication, but don't bring up
anything even remotely related to tech-sharing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
just said you foferred a technology trade, Lily."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'll ask
him about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "For
jus tQSA access. That's nothing to do with our relationship to them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
only brought it up because I wanted to get their reaction but I knew it's not
what our government would ever consider at this point. We just need to get the
QSA access restored."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils
and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well,

"That's a much better and more reasonable offer. However, due to current
situations with the provication of the current administration, I don't know how
they'd take that at this time."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah,

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "They can't just
set it for civilian pilots only? Surely there's a difference in transponders."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
hvae a solution to that, but no one will like it, and the government won't agree
to it, so it's probably irrelevant."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah it was so either way it's pirates who
already have access so I'm not clear on what Constantine was referring to."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As far as Iknow, Pirates alrady have their

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It

AEU won't contribute any more stuff, but if it comes down to it, the Accord will
defend them just like they would League and Fringe. So they're going to freeload
now."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
