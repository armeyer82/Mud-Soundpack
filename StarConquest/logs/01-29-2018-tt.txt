-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black
plastic tray of spider chow here.

(15 seconds roundtime.)
1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own.
What do you do and why?
First, I attempt to destroy any interdictors that may impede my escape.
Following that, I engage any ships that would prevent my departure such as any
chaining ships or ships that are interdicting. I then engage and attempt to
destroy  as many of the remaining ships as I can one at a time. My first and
foremost goal is to do everything I can to ensure that I have the ability to
leave the sector if necessary. Second, I want to destroy as many of the enemy
ships as I can so as to prevent them getting closer to civilian locations and
providing a very real threat.

appropriate, and is properly spellchecked! [Enter `yes' or `no']
y
2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
I would still take the same approach as in the question above with the exception
of the fact that I would alert everyone over tactical regarding my location,
number, and class of ships. I also would request others to respond to assist.
With it being a civilian location, it is my duty and responsibility to do
everything I can to protect and defend it. Therefore, I would fight as long as
necessary until the enemy is repelled or I run out of ships to fly.

y
3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships depend largely on grid, I
don't like running out of grid and the engineer can improve the recharge time of
the grid by using advanced tools. Since the engineer needs to be settled in
order to use them, I prefer to have the engineer always be ready to recharge the
grid or patch the hull in case the ship is hit.

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving
soon. What actions do you take?
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey guys."
I notify everyone over tactical of my situation ensuring that I state number and
classes of enemy ships. I then attempt to clear a way for me to leave the sector
by destroying any interdictors if there are only a few of them and I try to
destroy any ships that have me chained to them. If there are many interdictors
and they are too spread out, I may not be able to destroy them before more are
launched. My best option here then is to keep constantly moving away from the
enemy to give the engineer time to repair the hull and for reinforcements to
arrive. Landing in the sector is really the last thing I would do unless I felt
I had no choice as the engineer cannot use advanced tools to patch the hull.

y
5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
We destroy any small ships that may have accompanied the mothership and leave
the sector and notify both Steel Phoenix Command and Accord and don't return
without a cruiser that as PDB shielding and battle suits. The last mothership
could not be destroyed by conventional weapons so attacking it would be futile.

6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what
would be your priority and why?
My priority would be to protect primary beacon sectors and capitol planets.
Primary beacon sectors are gateways to capitol planets and the enemy could
inhibit a our ability to defend and protect the capitol planet by interdicting
primary sectors. Capitol planets have the highest population of civilians and is
home to our government and therefore should be protected.

7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing
commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So how do I get
to this beacon chain?"
I would carry out any orders the commander issued  and encourage my crew to do
the same within reason.

8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issued
missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?
I have flown in several salvage ops against, Omega Cartel, "Lambda Cartel and
Merry Band ships. I have also responded and fought against siege forces both in
AEU space and in other alliance space.

10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?
I expect it to stay undamaged less than a day as I plan to take it out and test
it in a beacon as soon as I obtain one. I often get hit at least once during a
decoy beacon drop.

this ship to help defend the AEU.

Blazing Trail place."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, no
worries."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What are you
applying for?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Constantine, just
read the info which Melinda posted on the General Exploration messages Board.
Initially though, just go to Campeche and one south to access the first beacon
which is 271 It's been awhile so you actually might need to start fromCampeche
itself. Then just follow the chain to 273 or 274. I forget which as I didn't pay
a lot of attention to the messages since don't plan to go. Then after you get
through the last beacon in the chain, use the heading posted."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So you progress from
either 270 to 271, to 272, then to 273 or whichever beacons are applicable."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "If you do plan to go,
please hold off and I'll put up a Xenology station which will give the org some
command at least even if you don't contribute points or funds and that will help
us."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay cool.
Just didn't know it was Campeche. And will the ship follow the beacons
automatically, or will I have to navigate to each one?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hold off on submitting
artifacts that is."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure thing."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "It will if you don't
intervene and press the fTL button."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "As they are auto-nav."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Any idea how
long the chain is timewise?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've only taken
it once and I want to say it was 4 hours or so, but I don't really remember."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, it's an
approval ship."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Forget that."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup one has to submit
an applicaiton for one. I plan to try but my Bastille kind of beats me up a bit
so hopefully I can better develop my solo skills as this seems like such a
funship to fly."
[AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battle-Scanning Battery-Powered Temporary Station
at Exploration Waypoint 51565 is now on emergency power.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
