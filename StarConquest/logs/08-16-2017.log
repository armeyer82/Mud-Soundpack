03:08:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

03:08:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:08:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:08:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:08:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:08:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:09:02 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

03:09:04 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 078" has jumped into the sector.

03:09:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:09:07 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 078! Welcome to home space!"

03:09:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:09:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Hyperion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:09:42 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

03:09:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident closes a bright orange 'FENG WO' canvas shopping bag.

03:09:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:09:47 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 078" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:09:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:09:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:09:49 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Hyperion in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:09:56 Via general sector communication, Hyperion transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

03:09:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:09:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Hyperion.

03:10:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:10:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:10:24 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:10:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

03:10:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:10:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:10:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

03:10:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:10:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

05:59:42 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You see, we're technically on strike. We really don't have any interesting things to do at the moment. I mean, I suppose we could spend some of that time shooting down Outsider patrols, but we can't spend -every- moment shooting down outsider patrols, you know?"

05:59:42 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Do you have yellow?"

06:01:10 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa sighs.

06:01:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was speaking with fellow pilots today,  not everything happens on general comms."

06:01:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We should. Joel. I'm quite the GMG freak. Sadly. I'd stay out there for days at a time if I could. That's...potentially lame."

06:04:26 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Demand sit downs with the government every single day so they can hear your demands. Picket New Earth and stop merchant traffic from getting through. Set up public demonstrations."

06:04:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well."

06:04:41 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Sitting back and waiting for whatever you guys are waiting for just lets him ignore you."

06:04:42 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "We were working on the latter."

06:07:14 [General Communication] Aisling assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as she transmits at the top of her lungs, "BEST IS A GIANT PILE OF SHITE, THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN FILTH, A DISEASE ON HUMANITY, AND IT WILL BE HEARD!"

06:08:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The problem with picketing is that we need a permit, and we'll just get tossed in jail. I'm sure they'd love nothing more than for us to try something like that."

06:09:10 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, you apparently need a permit for every fucking thing you want to organize."

06:09:43 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Trust us! We have been firing off ideas to one another back and forth until our eyes and optics units hurt!"

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Hyperion; Spaceport Landing Pad.

23:20:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's true. But it's useful if you're looking for only a certain kind of asteroid. Or there's a couple in the sector at the same time."

23:20:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've had comets pay out the most and the least."

23:20:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Same with metal rich and rocky. I've had my lowest payin at 288 be a radioactive."
