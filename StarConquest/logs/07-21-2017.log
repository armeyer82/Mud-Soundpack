00:38:44 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.

00:57:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Eli where are we meeting, besides the dock alpha of the torus? I'm there already, but was there some where else we were supposed to go?"

00:57:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can head to the broadcast booth if you like."

00:58:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Thank you."

00:58:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I may not be there until right before unfortuantely, but I'll do my best."

00:58:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright, I'll wait, I cannot broadcast without you, to be honest, I will not speak."

00:58:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I know I wanted everyoen to be thre half an hour earlier, but something's come up that apparenlty can't wait."

00:58:45 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

00:58:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "What?"

00:59:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Just a meeting that I have to go to, but it's supposedly will be very brief."

00:59:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "It had better be..."

00:59:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Let me go ahead and hop over there right now, I can at least give you an idea of what's goingto hapen, I'll just have to leave and come right back."

00:59:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright."

01:00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Looking for the broadcast booth right now."

01:00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's just north of the hallway to dock Beta actually."

01:00:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah."

01:02:45 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:02:55 You scramble to your feet.

01:02:55 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:02:57 You exit the ship.

01:02:58 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

01:03:03 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

01:03:03 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:03:03 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:03:04 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:03:05 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:03:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:03:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:03:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:03:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:03:14 The ship is already moving.

01:03:19 The ship is already moving.

01:03:21 The ship is already moving.

01:03:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:03:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:03:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:03:23 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:03:25 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

01:03:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:03:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:03:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:03:30 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:03:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:03:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:03:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:03:34 [MTTS] Ulias: Um guys, did something happen to the public broadcast center?

01:03:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:03:35 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:03:38 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:03:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Beta).

01:03:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:03:54 A gold time meter is currently displaying nothing.

01:03:54 You see some buttons labeled START, STOP, and CLEAR.

01:03:55 [MTTS] Ulias: Envermind.

01:03:57 The computer reports that the current time is 23:03 20 July 2317 GST.

01:04:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:04:28 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:04:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:04:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:04:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:04:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:04:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:04:48 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:04:49 You scramble to your feet.

01:04:49 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:04:51 You exit the ship.

01:04:52 [The Torus; Dock Beta]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You can go west.

01:04:54 [The Torus; Dock Beta Access]

01:04:55 You can go east and west.

01:04:57 [The Torus; Dock Beta]

01:04:57 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You can go west.

01:04:58 You can't go that way.

01:05:00 [The Torus; Dock Beta Access]

01:05:00 You can go east and west.

01:05:01 [The Torus; East Concourse]

01:05:01 You can go north, east, and south.

01:05:03 [The Torus; East Concourse]

01:05:03 You can go north and south.

01:05:05 [The Torus; East Concourse]

01:05:05 Though the curving walls and floor of this spacious corridor seem to be made of bare gray metal, the walls, meeting seamlessly overhead in an arched ceiling, glow softly with a pale white light, and the floor is such that it muffles even the heaviest footfalls. On either side of the corridor is a row of tall windows that provides on one side a glimpse of the inner curve of the opposite side of the Torus and, on the other, the sight of the starry black space beyond the station.
You can go north and south.

01:05:19 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:05:26 [The Torus; East Concourse]

01:05:26 You can go north, east, and south.

01:05:26 [The Torus; Dock Beta Access]
You can go east and west.

01:05:28 [The Torus; Dock Beta Access]

01:05:29 Though the curving walls and floor of this spacious corridor seem to be made of bare gray metal, the walls, meeting seamlessly overhead in an arched ceiling, glow softly with a pale white light, and the floor is such that it muffles even the heaviest footfalls. Through a wide doorway to the west is the station's East Concourse, and to the east is Docking Bay Beta.
You can go east and west.

01:05:38 [The Torus; Dock Beta]

01:05:38 You can go west.

01:05:41 [The Torus; Dock Beta]

01:05:41 The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, against the starry expanse of space, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. A sign indicates that the main concourse is to the west, and the doorway to a rare starship supply store is to the south, but it has been closed and securely locked.
You can go west.

01:05:44 [The Torus; Dock Beta Access]

01:05:44 You can go east and west.

01:05:46 [The Torus; Dock Beta Access]

01:05:47 Though the curving walls and floor of this spacious corridor seem to be made of bare gray metal, the walls, meeting seamlessly overhead in an arched ceiling, glow softly with a pale white light, and the floor is such that it muffles even the heaviest footfalls. Through a wide doorway to the west is the station's East Concourse, and to the east is Docking Bay Beta.
You can go east and west.

01:06:11 Go where?

01:06:12 [The Torus; East Concourse]

01:06:13 You can go north, east, and south.

01:06:15 [The Torus; East Concourse]

01:06:15 Here at the easternmost part of the Torus's East Concourse, a bank of large windows on the west side of the corridor provides a view of the opposite side of the station. Spacious, well-lit corridors follow the curve of the station around to the north and south, while another wide corridor leads east toward Docking Bay Beta.
You can go north, east, and south.

01:06:25 [The Torus; East Concourse]

01:06:25 You can go north and south.

On either side of the corridor is a row of tall windows that provides on one side a glimpse of the inner curve of the opposite side of the Torus and, on the other, the sight of the starry black space beyond the station. A door leads to the Public Access Center.
You can go north and south.

01:06:43 Go where?

01:06:48 [The Torus; Public Access Center]

01:06:48 You see a metal container here.
Eli Grey and Evangeline Adaire are standing here.
You can go out.

01:06:53 Eli Grey waves to you.

01:06:55 You wave.

01:07:15 Eli Grey asks, "You cool wiht letting me do all the talking shule?"

01:07:19 Evangeline nods her head, messing with a space imaging photograph of Experimental Research Structure Station for a moment. "All right. And how will this become a thing?"

01:07:22 You say, "Oh, please do."

01:07:27 You nod to Eli Grey.

01:07:55 Evangeline Adaire asks, "Alright... Where is the backdrop?"

01:07:59 Eli says to Evangeline, "We're going to show the citizens of the AEU the power of the Outsiders. Show them that it's not a threat that can be dealt with by any one single alliance."

01:08:32 Eli points to the broadcast booth, "It's in there. we won't be allowed in until two minutes before the time slot.

01:08:42 Evangeline nods her head slowly. "Alright. I can get behind that."

01:08:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person hammerhead "Wuthering Fights".

01:09:09 Eli Grey says, "Don't worry, nothing is going to happen to you guys. I won't be saying anything slanderous."

01:09:35 Sighing, Evangeline looks a bit befuddled, though shakes her head a moment later at Eli's assessment. 'No it's all right." she murmurs, fidgeting and messing with a space imaging photograph of Experimental Research Structure Station for a moment.

01:09:42 Eli Grey says, "And my hope is, that if you folks don't speak, then you will be safer from being rogued or anything of that nature. Even if we get rogued I doubt it will last very long."

01:10:08 "And you think that you will be rogued for speaking your mind?" Evangeline asks, a little tiredly.

01:10:12 Eli Grey says, "I highly doubt anything will happen to us though. If it does I will take full responsibility."

01:10:24 Evangeline Adaire says, "You should not have to take full responsibility."

01:10:27 Eli says to Evangeline, "I have no idea what Best will do."

01:10:43 Evangeline Adaire says, "Apparently he won't be on his Best behavior either."

01:10:48 Eli Grey grins at Evangeline Adaire.

01:11:13 Evangeline chuckles for a moment as she stands calmly. "Well, let's hope." she murmurs with a smile.

01:11:23 You nod.

01:11:37 You smile at Evangeline Adaire.

01:11:39 Eli says to you, "When I give the cue, just stand before the backdrop that will be inside, and hold up one of these images. At the end, we will all thrust our fists into the air and shout "for theUnion, the Accord, and humanity" sound good?"

01:11:40 You hug Evangeline Adaire.

01:11:57 You say, "Sounds great."

01:12:16 You ask, "Which images?"

01:12:20 I don't understand that.

01:12:28 Evangeline Adaire says, "They are in the container."

01:12:28 You are carrying nothing.

01:12:33 You say, "Ah, ok."

01:12:37 Eli Grey says, "I had planned to go into this with more detail with you folks beforehand, but I apparently have to meet with wellington at 23:30 I've been told it will not take long."

01:12:43 I see no "image" in a large expandable telescoping xenology container.

01:12:43 Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.

01:12:48 I see no "cointainer" here.

01:12:51 a large expandable telescoping xenology container

01:12:51 You see nothing special.
It is open.
It is empty.

01:13:05 a metal container

01:13:05 You see nothing special.
It is open.
Inside it you see a space imaging photograph of a field of twisted starship wreckage, a space imaging photograph of Mir Station, a space imaging photograph of Grenwold A, and a photo of Grenwold Remnant; Crater.

01:13:06 Evangeline Adaire asks, "Wait... Does wellington know about this? Perhaps he wants the broadcast cut off before it can get started?"

01:13:12 Evangeline Adaire glances down at her watch momentarily.

01:13:19 I see no "image" in a metal container.

01:13:23 Eli Grey asks, "Can you fill Lily in when she gets here, so I can go when it's time?"

01:13:32 You remove a space imaging photograph of a field of twisted starship wreckage from a metal container.

01:13:43 Eli says to Evangeline, "No, and Wellington wouldn't want this pulled down anyways. It's on a different issue."

01:13:45 Evangeline nods her head. "I'll let Shule do it." she says with a slight smile.

01:13:56 Evangeline says to Eli, "Oh Goddess above, all right."

01:13:56 You nod.

01:14:08 Eli Grey says, "I don't think that anyone will be able to stop this broadcast, except the EAOS."

01:14:26 Eli says to Evangeline, "Yeah, I picked the wrong term to start being Voice for sure."

01:14:27 Evangeline chuckles. "It will be hell if you aren't there and we are standing there staring at the camera's."

01:14:31 Eli chuckles nervously.

01:14:37 Eli Grey says, "No no, you won't be."

01:14:43 Evangeline Adaire laughs. "You did indeed, but hopefully, it won't be an issue."

01:15:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Where are you Love?"

01:15:13 Evangeline Adaire says, "We have not had a good voice in a long time. I'm not saying Kim isn't a good voice, or when she was, but... still."

01:15:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm at the public access center at the Torus."

01:15:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."

01:15:33 Eli says to Evangeline, "Kim did a great job for someone who didn't actually want to be voice in the first place."

01:15:37 Eli Grey grins.

01:15:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'll be there shortly."

01:15:46 Eli Grey says, "But yeah, she's not around much, I see."

01:15:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

01:15:50 Evangeline nods her head. "I know how she feels. I don't want to have to deal with the government either.'

01:16:07 "She isn't." Evangeline Adaire shakes her head. "She's around some of the time, but eh."

01:16:10 Eli Grey says, "If Vernos shows up, you can tell him not to waste his time. He's not coming in. That guy is a loose cannon."

01:16:25 Eli Grey says, "He's likely to try and turn this whole thing into some kind of witch hunt and we don't need that."

01:16:31 You say, "No kidding."

01:16:43 Evangeline nods her head. "He is a lose cannon. He has ... thoughts about things that make me want to sshake him and tell him to learn his place."

01:16:57 Eli Grey says, "I didn't want to exclude anyone, but yeah, it's too risky to let him in."

01:17:04 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

01:17:05 Evangeline Adaire says, "I thought you were the one who was working with him? He thinks changing the alliance can be done in a day. It cannot."

01:17:38 Evangeline Adaire says, "And yes, he kept arguing with Cheri even when I told him to drop it. He can't keep his mouth shut."

01:17:52 Eli Grey says, "I was trying to work with him, but things have changed I guess. I'm not really sure what his actual agenda is. He's all over the place with how he feels about stuff."

01:18:26 Eli Grey says, "One second he's telling me that everyone needs to be investigated, and the enxt he's asking me to write to Cheri and explain what he really said and so forth. Not really sure what his game is."

01:18:32 Evangeline nods her head and frowns a little, sighing as she takes a breath, as if to speak, though thinks better of it and silences herself. finally, she just nods. "I don't know what to think about him, to be honest. I think sometimes he's with us, and sometimes he's just against everyone."

01:18:49 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

01:18:56 Eli Grey says, "I had high hopes for him, I really did."

01:18:59 Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

01:19:00 Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.

01:19:06 Evangeline Adaire says, "I don't know. Perhaps he can still be salvages."

01:19:10 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

01:19:11 Evangeline Adaire says, "Salvaged, too."

01:19:12 Eli Grey says, "Let's hope so."

01:19:33 Eli Grey says, "Alright I'm going to try and get over there and see if I can't get this done early."

01:19:44 You nod to Eli Grey.

01:19:52 You say, "See you in a few."

01:19:53 Eli Grey says, "Be right back. I won't leave you guys hanging,  even if I have to run outta there while Wellington is still talking."

01:19:59 You grin.

01:19:59 Eli Grey waves.

01:20:01 Eli Grey's group walks out.

01:20:02 I don't see that here.

01:20:05 Eli Grey's group just arrived.

01:20:08 Eli Grey disbands his group.

01:20:10 Evangeline Adaire says, "Although I don't know. With the things Cheri was saying... Although I truely believe that he just argues for the sake of argument."

01:20:15 Eli Grey says, "I tried to steal Eva."

01:20:20 Eli Grey says, "Sorry about that."

01:20:20 You say, "I see that."

01:20:20 Evangeline Adaire grins. "Bad."

01:20:24 Eli Grey grins.

01:20:28 You hug Evangeline Adaire.

01:20:30 Eli Grey walks out.

01:20:30 Evangeline Adaire says, "See you. Have fun with Wellington."

01:20:33 You say, "No stealing her."

01:20:43 Evangeline Adaire chuckles. "Don't overprotect me. I have a riffle."

01:20:45 Evangeline Adaire says, "Rifle."

01:20:46 Evangeline Adaire grins.

01:20:49 You grin.

01:21:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm where is the public center?"

01:21:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Near dock bata, just south of the access to dock beta."

01:22:15 Lily Kaise just arrived.

01:22:18 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:22:23 You hug Lily Kaise.

01:22:24 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:22:29 Lily Kaise hugs you.

01:22:32 Lily Kaise waves to Evangeline Adaire.

01:24:08 Lily Kaise removes a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

01:24:12 Lily Kaise puts a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:24:17 Lily Kaise removes a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

01:24:22 Lily Kaise puts a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria' in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:25:00 You say to Lily, "Grab an photo from the container there. Eli wants us to hold them up when he gives the cue and at the end. We'll thrust our fists into the air and shout, For the Union, The Accord, and humanity."

01:25:05 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

01:25:16 You say to Evangeline, "Did I miss anything?"

01:25:22 Lily Kaise removes a space imaging photograph of Mir Station from a metal container.

01:26:41 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:26:52 Lily says to you, "You look very nice Love."

01:26:59 Lily says to Evangeline, "So do you."

01:26:59 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Thanks."

01:27:07 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved pale blue silk blouse with a shawl collar, a slim navy blue natural silk skirt, and a pair of strappy navy blue silk sandals. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, both knees, bo
01:27:07 th calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying a space imaging photograph of Mir Station in her right hand.

01:27:07 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:27:20 You say to Lily, "And so do you."

01:27:22 You grin.

01:27:43 Lily Kaise says, "Oh thanks nothing special but I felt I should wear conservative."

01:27:51 You smile.

01:28:22 "I've umm." You glance around at your surroundings. "Never done anything like this... I hope I do everything right."

01:28:26 Evangeline Adaire glances down at her watch momentarily.

01:28:32 Evangeline Adaire yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

01:28:40 You look at Evangeline Adaire thoughtfully.

01:28:43 Evangeline Adaire suddenly awakens.

01:28:45 Evangeline Adaire sighs.

01:28:50 Evangeline Adaire glances down at her watch momentarily.

01:28:52 You say to Evangeline, "You ok?"

01:29:04 Evangeline Adaire says, "Yes, I'm all right."

01:29:06 Evangeline Adaire smiles.

01:29:10 You smile.

01:29:35 Lily says to you, "I'm proud of that photo you are holding."

01:29:39 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:29:40 Evangeline Adaire says, "I was just standing here and wondering how I'm going to do this."

01:29:43 You smile.

01:29:50 I don't see that here.

01:29:59 Evangeline Adaire says, "And hoping upon hope Eli is here."

01:30:04 Evangeline Adaire says, "Or will be here."

01:30:10 "Yeah, me too." You nod to Evangeline Adaire. "I've never been on TV or whatever."

01:30:15 Lily says to you, "You Kim and I discovered it."

01:30:20 Evangeline Adaire says, "I was once, though it was a long time ago. The ball."

01:30:23 Though close to inhabited space, this starship graveyard is too far from a planetary body or major gravitational field to eventually spread apart. The wrecks and debris here will remain floating as they are right now for perhaps an eternity unless someone like yourself interferes.
A hardcopy of sensor readings is printed in the bottom-right corner, alongside the label "Final Resting Place of New Earth 40th."

01:30:26 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah."

01:30:36 You nod to Lily Kaise.

01:30:37 Evangeline Adaire smiles. "I still have dress clothing from that ball."

01:30:42 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:31:17 You ask, "Which Ball?"

01:31:23 Evangeline shakes her head and sighs, pressing her fingers into her braid as she waits.

01:31:42 Evangeline Adaire yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

01:32:00 Evangeline Adaire suddenly awakens.

01:32:32 Evangeline Adaire says, OOCly, "Sorry guys internet is being a pain."

01:32:43 You say, OOCly, "No worries. I know the feeling."

01:34:28 Evangeline Adaire yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

01:34:39 Evangeline Adaire suddenly awakens.

01:34:51 Evangeline Adaire says, OOCly, "I seem to be getting huge lag spikes with sc and nowhere else. Odd."

01:35:00 You say, OOCly, "That is strange."

01:42:07 Evangeline Adaire suddenly awakens.

01:43:27 Evangeline Adaire glances down at her watch momentarily.

01:43:36 Evangeline Adaire says, "It's almost time for the broadcast."

01:44:31 I see no "watch" here.

01:44:33 a gold wrist-mounted chronometer

01:44:34 It covers nothing.
You glance down at your watch, noting the time:

01:44:36 You nod.

01:44:39 You say, "It is."

01:44:47 Evangeline Adaire asks, "You all right?"

01:44:51 You say, "Definitely gettin ng closer."

01:44:59 You say, "Getting."

01:45:00 Evangeline nods her head. 'Yup."

01:45:10 You nod to Evangeline Adaire. "Just nervous."

01:45:10 Lily Kaise says, "I'll be right back."

01:45:13 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:45:23 Evangeline Adaire nods.

01:45:25 Evangeline Adaire says, "I see."

01:45:50 Evangeline Adaire asks, "Where is she going, do you know?"

01:45:56 You say, "I have no idea."

01:46:01 Evangeline Adaire nods.

01:46:18 Shule shifts his weight from one foot to the other.

01:46:42 Evangeline Adaire says, "I think it'll be all right."

01:46:48 Evangeline Adaire says, "As long as Eli gets here."

01:46:53 You nod.

01:47:18 You say, "I just hope I don't make a total fool of myself in front of the cameras."

01:47:29 Evangeline chuckles and shakes her head. "I'm sure you won't."

01:48:08 You say, "I'm certainly going to try not to."

01:48:22 Evangeline smiles at you. "You'll be fine I promise."

01:48:34 You look at a gold vase containing a bouquet of fire and ice roses and red roses and smile. "Thanks."

01:48:40 Evangeline Adaire says, "Let's just hope I don't faint on the floor."

01:48:42 Evangeline Adaire grins.

01:48:45 You grin at Evangeline Adaire.

01:48:51 Ather Jammoa just arrived.

01:48:57 You wave to Ather Jammoa.

01:49:10 Evangeline turns to Ather Jammoa. She smiles a little.

01:49:13 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Hey, you dressed up!"

01:49:15 Ather Jammoa says, "Woo."

01:49:20 You grin.

01:49:42 Evangeline Adaire says, "I didn't dress up, but I probably should have."

01:50:59 Evangeline Adaire says, "Although I did put makeup on."

01:51:04 You grin at Evangeline Adaire.

01:52:10 Evangeline chuckles slightly. "So Eli wants us to hold up images when we are cued against the backdrop he has apparently set up." she says to Ather. "In case you haven't been informed."

01:52:32 Lily Kaise just arrived.

01:52:42 Lily Kaise glances down at her exquisite platinum watch with diamond accents momentarily.

01:52:54 Evangeline Adaire glances down at her watch momentarily.

01:53:01 Evangeline Adaire says, "Um... we are cutting it close."

01:53:05 Lily Kaise removes a space imaging photograph of Mir Station from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

01:53:16 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:53:27 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:54:06 Ather Jammoa points at the Aria Star. "I am wearing my image."

01:54:13 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:54:23 Evangeline chuckles slightly. "Mmm." she says.

01:54:24 Ather Jammoa says, "I am wearing many images."

01:54:33 Ather Jammoa points at The Phoenix Burst and points at a dark blue and white Accord of Free Worlds Meritorious Service medal.

01:54:39 Evangeline Adaire says, "I'm wearing just my dress and sandals and makeup. So I'll hold up this one."

01:54:52 Evangeline Adaire taps a space imaging photograph of Experimental Research Structure Station.

01:55:29 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm I hoped Constantine would be here."

01:55:44 You say to Lily, "He can't make it. Something came up."

01:55:44 Evangeline Adaire says, "He had to do a thing."

01:55:54 Evangeline Adaire says, "I heard that earlier today."

01:55:55 Ather Jammoa says, "If you guys wanted to hold up images, you probably should've used posters instead of photographs. Bit too late now though."

01:55:56 Lily Kaise says, "Oh that happens."

01:56:14 You nod to Ather Jammoa. "Yeah, that makes more sense."

01:56:27 Evangeline Adaire says, "Erm... well I didn't do this bit."

01:56:35 Evangeline Adaire says, "Just holding up what I was told to."

01:56:41 You nod.

01:56:55 Ather Jammoa says, "I am grandly logical individual, tis true."

01:57:19 Lily Kaise says, "I agree I do have a posterizer near by but not sure we could put them together in time."

01:57:24 Evangeline Adaire says, "Um... no."

01:57:28 Evangeline Adaire glances down at her watch momentarily.

01:57:30 Eli Grey just arrived.

01:57:33 Lily Kaise waves to Eli Grey.

01:57:35 Eli Grey takes Ather Jammoa into his group.

01:57:36 Evangeline Adaire says, "Since we'd only have three minutes to do it."

01:57:38 Eli Grey takes Lily Kaise into his group.

01:57:39 Eli Grey takes Evangeline Adaire into his group.

01:57:41 Eli Grey takes you into his group.

01:57:42 You wave to Eli Grey.

01:57:51 Shule takes a nervous breath.

01:58:06 Lily smoothes her collar.

01:58:22 Evangeline stands calmly, tapping a space imaging photograph of Experimental Research Structure Station briefly before she sighs softly.

01:58:49 Eli Grey nods.

02:00:18 Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.

02:00:28 Evangeline Adaire glances down at her watch momentarily.

02:00:32 Eli Grey says, "Um."

02:00:44 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Go door and go studio and stuff isn't working."

02:00:45 Lily Kaise asks, OOCly, "Go studio?"

02:01:03 [The Torus; Public Access Center]

02:01:03 This is a simple room with pale walls and carpeting. A terminal allows one to purchase blocks of time. A thick door leads to the broadcast studio beyond.
You see a metal container here.
Evangeline Adaire, Ather Jammoa, Lily Kaise, and Eli Grey are standing here.
You can go out.

02:01:08 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

02:01:23 You ask, OOCly, "Go door?"

02:01:45 [MTTS] Ulias: Go studio, go door, go broadcast, none of these are working a little help?

02:01:54 Lily Kaise says, OOCly, "Enter."

02:01:57 Eli Grey enters the studio.

02:02:30 This is a small soundproofed room with pale walls and soft cream-colored carpeting. A similarly cream-colored chair and sofa are available for the host and guests. A small wooden table is available next to both, and a fake potted fern is in one corner. A small clock is present on the wall, usually off so as not to provide a distraction, but ready to provide a silent warning when time is running short.

02:02:39 Eli Grey straightens a silver and green shipsuit with the AEU logo centered on the chest and clears his throat.

02:03:03 Eli stands before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and looks into the camera.

02:03:20 Eli Grey says, "Fellow citizens of the galaxy, AEU and esteemed members of it's government... we,  the members of the civilian pilot corps have gathered here today in an attempt to reach out to you all in the most direct fashion that we can. thank you to those who have tuned in to hear what we have to say."

02:03:51 Eli Grey says, "We may not all agree on everything all of the time, but there's one thing we all have in common, we all want what is best for our beloved Union. As we speak, the AEU is making plans to withdraw completely from the Accord of Free Worlds, and despite what has been in the news lately, nearly every member of the pilot corps believes this is not a good plan of action for the Union."

02:05:00 Eli Grey removes a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" from a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:05:33 Eli holds up a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa", and says "this is a document that was sent to our government highlighting the reasons the Accord is necessary for us and indeed, all of humanity. It was signed by every member of the corps that was present at a meeting held on July first. I will not subject you to a full reading of this document, but allow me to summarize. if anyone would like to read the full document for themselves, it will be made available on request. It describes the importance of the Accord and it's functions. the intel , research, and technology that the Accord provides is invaluable to the survival of humanity and of course, the Union. indeed we would not all be here even today without the breakthroughs of their scientists, including scientists of the Unionn, and the vigilance of those who keep watch over human space."

02:07:08 Eli Grey says, "The threat that we face is great, it remains as the biggest threat to humankind that there has ever been. Make no mistake that,  no matter the strength of the Union, this is not a threat that any one alliance can handle on it's own. We pilots assist our great military in defending your lives, your homes, and your families. However we have only been able to do so successfuly due to the assistance that the Accord provides. Let us not forget the power of our enemy."

02:07:51 Eli gestures to his fellow pilots.

02:08:03 Shule Elemmire stands before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and holds up a space imaging photograph of a field of twisted starship wreckage.

02:08:27 Evangeline Adaire stands before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and holds up a space imaging photograph of Experimental Research Structure Station.

02:09:53 Lily Kaise holds up a space imaging photograph of Mir Station as she stands before the AEU phoenix symbol backdrop.

02:10:21 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

02:10:33 Eli Grey says, "These are images of what remains after the Outsider attacks during the war. Events that we remember all too well. For many years now the Accord has staved off such attacks and worked towards finding new ways to defend humanity, and to one day, take the fight to the Outsiders themselves."

02:11:48 Eli Grey says, "To members of the Union, pay special note to that image of destroyed starships. This is what is left of the new earth 40th. This is what happens when an aliance fleet must face an Outisder one without the aid of the Accord and other alliance fleets."

02:12:47 Eli allows the images to linger for a moment longer before continuing.

02:12:54 Eli nods solemnly and says, "this is the power of our enemy. an enemy that can destroy mighty stations and whole worlds with a single weapon. an enemy that cares not if you are Union, League, Fringe, or Mutuality. an enemy that wants only one thing... the complete annihilation of every single human, the extinction of our entire species. the threat of pirates and other threats pales in comparison. what price can possibly be placed on the protection of humankind?"

Eli Grey, Ather Jammoa, Lily Kaise, and Evangeline Adaire are standing here.
You can go out.

02:15:32 Eli Grey says, "We can defeat them, but not alone. Without the combined strength of the Accord of Free Worlds, we simply do not have a chance at preventing the repeating of these tragic events."

02:21:04 Eli gestures to the pilots standing before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and says, "these pilots know this all too well. we have all faced many battles against the Outsiders, and our other alien threat, the IFs. If we remove ourselves from the Accord, we will essentially be abandoing these fine folks folks, who defend our homes, and risk these threats daily to provide the Union with valuable resources to rebuild those that have been destroyed.

02:21:36 Eli Grey says, "So, in conclusion, we urge the members of the government to reconsider withdrawl from the Accord. We simply must find some other way to find the funds that the Union needs. Pulling out of the Accord will only result in weakening the Union and the Accord, leaving all of us more vulnerable. To the citizens listening out there tonight that agree, we urge you to write to your government officials and tell them you do not want the Union to withdraw from the Accord of Free world's. Thank you all again for tuning in tonight to hear what we have to say. May you all find peace, and joy in your lives."

02:22:29 Eli stands before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and thrusts his fist in the air, shouting, "for the Union, the Accord, and humanity!"

02:22:59 Evangeline stands before a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" raises her fist and shouts, "For the union, the accord, and humanity!"

02:23:22 I don't understand that.

02:23:38 Eli smiles at Evangeline, Lily, you, and a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" "thank you for joining me here tonight everyone."

02:23:43 Lily 

02:23:49 Eli Grey looks at a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" and smiles.

02:23:57 Eli Grey puts a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

02:24:15 Eli Grey says, "Goodnight Galaxy."

03:12:49 Board what?

03:12:54 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.

03:12:54 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:12:59 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

03:12:59 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

03:13:01 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

03:13:04 I don't understand that.

03:13:05 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

03:13:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:13:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:13:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:13:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:13:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:13:20 The ship is already moving.

03:13:22 The ship is already moving.

03:13:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:13:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:13:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:13:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:13:28 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

03:13:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:13:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:13:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:13:34 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:13:34 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:13:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:13:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:13:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:13:38 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:13:41 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

03:13:44 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:14:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:14:08 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:14:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:14:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:14:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:14:28 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:14:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:14:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:14:36 You scramble to your feet.

03:14:37 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:14:37 You exit the ship.

03:14:42 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

03:14:42 You can go up.

03:14:46 You peer into stairway to the pilot's lounge...

03:14:46 
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
You can go out.

03:14:55 Your communicator reports that...

03:14:56 
At least ten recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

03:15:01 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

03:15:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:15:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:15:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:15:21 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 691" has jumped into the sector.

03:15:24 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 691! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

03:15:25 The ship is already moving.

03:15:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:15:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:15:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:15:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

03:15:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:15:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:15:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:15:35 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:17:25 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Where are they Hakeem?"

03:17:29 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "On my way."

03:17:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:17:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:17:34 [Tactical Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Same."

03:17:34 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

03:17:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:17:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gonzo I mean."

03:17:38 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:17:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

03:17:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:17:48 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Second Battle."

03:17:51 The ship is already moving.

03:17:53 The ship is already moving.

03:17:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:17:54 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

03:17:54 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:17:54 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:17:55 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

03:17:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:18:00 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You full?"

03:18:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:18:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:18:01 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

03:18:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:18:12 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "For now no hostile ships. But I want to crew just in case. I'm fairly sure a response will follow."

03:18:15 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I can come if you want me."

03:18:18 The computer reports that the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

03:18:22 The computer reports that the one-person runabout "Schraft Craft" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", the one-person runabout "Schraft Craft", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

03:18:50 Go where?

03:18:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the sleek glass doorway of the pilot lounge.

03:18:52 Go where?

03:18:55 [Chetumal Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

03:18:56 You see a gleaming granite-topped bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a trash can emblazoned with the triumphant image of Space Chief Marshal Nina Thomas, and a brightly-colored educational poster here.
You can go out.

03:19:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just arrived.

03:19:04 You peer out...

03:19:04 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The one-person runabout "Schraft Craft" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

03:19:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

03:19:11 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

03:19:14 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:19:17 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What'd ya do, shoot at a transport and waitin on the six pincers?"

03:19:29 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the five-person torpedo boat "Orcinus Orca" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

03:19:38 Gonzales Bourne just arrived.

03:19:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

03:19:43 Gonzales Bourne takes you into his group.

03:19:45 Gonzales Bourne takes Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident into his group.

03:19:46 You wave.

03:19:47 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 11,022,656.25 credits from a xenology submission.

03:19:47 Gonzales Bourne waves.

03:19:55 Gonzales Bourne speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator:

03:19:55 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "We seem to need 2 more."

03:19:57 Gonzales Bourne says, "Nice job guys."

03:20:03 Lily says to Gonzales, "May I engineer?"

03:20:06 Gonzales Bourne says, "Of course."

03:20:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles. "Thanks."

03:20:22 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you brought it in there yourself shootin at a transport...enjoy that response."

03:21:10 Gonzales Bourne says, "Let me check on the status, will be back."

03:21:11 Gonzales Bourne disbands his group.

03:21:11 Gonzales Bourne sprints out.

03:21:28 Gonzales Bourne just arrived.

03:21:33 Gonzales Bourne takes you into his group.

03:21:36 Gonzales Bourne takes Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident into his group.

03:21:40 You catch a glimpse of movement, and look up through the tinted glass to see the two-person Accord gemini "Crossfire" descending from space and landing on the nearby landing pad.

03:22:12 Gonzales Bourne gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:23:31 Gonzales Bourne says, "It probably left by now. Many said they'd join, but alas. Will let you know if it happens again."

03:23:38 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "What's going on?"

03:23:42 Gonzales Bourne says, "Thanks for coming though, I really appretiate that."

03:23:56 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Little late."

03:23:59 Lily says to Gonzales, "I will just hangout here for a bit."

03:24:06 You say, "Sure."

03:24:07 Gonzales Bourne says, "Oh. Sounds great."

03:24:10 Gonzales Bourne gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

03:24:20 Gonzales Bourne says, "Let me go check on the status again then."

03:24:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

03:24:45 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Ali, why don't you check League sectors? I have Shule and Lily here."

03:24:47 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

03:25:11 Gonzales Bourne asks, "Are you guys rogued too?"

03:25:20 Gonzales Bourne says, "Or just Eli and Ather."

03:25:23 You say, "No."

03:25:27 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Pirate."

03:25:34 Gonzales Bourne nods.

03:26:11 Gonzales Bourne disbands his group.

03:26:12 Gonzales Bourne sprints out.

03:26:22 Gonzales Bourne just arrived.

03:26:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Vernos made a lot of noise about that trip because he was angry that he wasn't invited."

03:27:38 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Well how many chunks are there? We can take care of it if we have enough time."

03:28:30 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Alright. Should we meet you there then?"

03:28:47 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

03:28:53 Gonzales Bourne says, "Just to summarize, not sure if you guys have heard of recent events with pirates."

03:29:08 You ask, "What's up?"

03:29:15 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Well a gunship can do the trick."

03:32:16 Gonzales Bourne says, "We've been actively trying to prevent pirates from salvaging in our space. However, as of recently, they started to respond with an overwhelming amount of warships whenever we chased them away and they started to threaten us. In our own space. So instead of defeating the response with a fighter, we started to crew before intervening so we could fight better. Obviously we are not going to just let them threaten us and fly around our sectors as if it belonged to them."

03:32:17 Gonzales Bourne gestures vaguely.

03:32:33 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Including you too, apparently."

03:32:47 You nod to Gonzales Bourne.

03:32:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Gonzales Bourne.

03:33:30 Gonzales Bourne says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Well a gunship can take care of a few pincers just fine."

03:33:56 You say, "It depends on how good the pilots are in those picers."

03:34:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:34:01 Gonzales Bourne grins and nods.

03:34:03 Gonzales Bourne says, "However, some pilots disagree with us. They say "it's pointless to threaten/shoot transports because they are harmless.""

03:34:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Looks like you got what you were really after all along Vern. Congrats on voice of the corps. I pray for the Union."

03:34:20 You say, "I watched Cesar get hammered by picers and hammerheads."

03:34:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Why not? They are stealing valuable resources."

03:34:29 Gonzales Bourne nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:34:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Best's Boy Vernos Bailey transmits, "I did not want voice of the corps. Not this way."

03:34:38 Gonzales Bourne says, "Exactly. That's what we're trying to communicate."

03:34:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They are also acting as decoys."

03:34:47 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

03:34:55 You nod.

03:34:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm sure you didn't ever think that ever. You do not think. I believe you have no brain."

03:35:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:35:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nono Eva you are not a scarecrow."

03:35:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:35:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
Gonzales Bourne says, "Not only that, that's how they make these hostile ships. With these resources. So yes, a transport can be considered as dangerous as any other armed ship."

03:35:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Precisely."

03:35:37 You nod.

03:35:48 You say, "I shoot at transports all the time when they're pirate ones."

03:35:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I wasn't quite putting into that metaphor but ok."

03:36:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Shule and I enjoy it as we don't want those garbage collectors around."

03:36:26 You nod.

03:37:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

03:38:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I think I'd like to head over to Old earth for a little while as I will need to sleep at some point. Gonzo I'll be here for you and will come back should the need arise."

03:38:25 Gonzales Bourne nods.

03:38:27 Gonzales Bourne says, "Thank you."

03:38:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles and waves.

03:38:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

03:38:35 Gonzales Bourne waves.

03:38:37 You nod to Gonzales Bourne.

03:38:38 You wave.

03:38:40 You say, "Same here."

03:39:13 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

03:39:15 The computer reports that the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" has jumped out of the sector.

03:39:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:39:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:39:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:39:19 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.

03:41:45 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Only one thing left to do now."

03:41:45 Morris Corlew says, "He's a traitor, way I see it. But Best kinda is too really. He wants to make the AEU great again, but...he's doin the opposite."

03:41:45 Kerry Rodriguez folds up his mail bin and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

03:41:52 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident removes a small bag of Chippy's Chips from a metal container.

03:42:22 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I do my part by not buying revo batteries for my ships."

03:43:06 Eli says to Lily, "Thank you."

03:43:08 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I want to make our alliance an exploration alliance again."

03:43:18 Emily says to Pierre-Louis, "The mighty galleon."

03:43:20 Ted Warburton says, "I want us to explore more too though."

03:43:20 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Somehow."

03:43:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I at least got out with my Platform so I still can."

03:43:38 Morris Corlew says, "The mighty rift carrier."

03:43:39 Morris Corlew grins.

03:43:39 Emily says to Ted, "You've always been militarily focused, I think that'd be hard to change."

03:43:43 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Even if it is just going on a trip that has nothing to do with anything, but I don't even know if we'll last long enough for that."

03:43:44 Pierre-Louis says to Emily, "Well, Mutuality is best by default, of course. But I meant mantle between planet alliances."

03:43:52 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I'm wondering if I should return to New Earth.. You don't think it's showing weakness that i'm here and not there, do you?"

03:44:05 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps, just to check my mail. See what happens."

03:44:09 Emily says to Eli, "No, you're among friends."

03:44:12 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think you can still land."

03:44:14 Ted Warburton says, "Exactly."

03:44:17 Sarah Bellamy says, "And most of you are here. That's not weak."

03:44:20 Lily nods hesitantly towards Eli.

03:44:23 Morris says to Eli, "Nah. You're hangin out where the folks are."

03:44:28 Emily says to Eli, "Though like I said, Asteris could land on home soil and she was a rogue."

03:44:31 "Of course." Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods. "I am not afraid to land on my home planet."

03:44:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "AEU did have some good recent success with discovery of the aquarium, even Most Grasping One Gunarsh. It just went very downhill from there, even if some people tried to save it with explorer corps."

03:44:40 Morris Corlew says, "Rogue don't blacklist ya."

03:44:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:44:46 Eli says to Lily, "Don't worry, this will be over soon enough Lily."

03:44:46 Morris Corlew says, "Sol lands here."

03:44:58 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "And he's deff rogue."

03:45:05 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh, not talking about that. Just because I'm not blacklisted doesn't mean there's not a security detail waiting to take me away."

03:45:05 Morris Corlew nods. "He is."

03:45:07 Ted Warburton says, "Yep, he was around earlier."

03:45:20 Lily says to Eli, "Yeah I know. I'll probably just fly out out in to the very deep and be there until my days are over."

03:45:25 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm. They'd have Ather already though."

03:45:26 Emily says to Eli, "Did you ask Ather if he was hauled away?"

03:45:29 Ali Candan just arrived.

03:45:30 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:45:33 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Very... positive lily very positive."

03:45:35 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "But.. if it is, and I don't show.. I don't want the people we've reached to change their mind because I didn't show my face."

03:45:37 Ali Candan sits down on a cushy booth seat.

03:45:38 Katina Faye smiles at Ali Candan.

03:45:45 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:45:45 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, "Did you land anywhere Ather?"

03:45:48 Katina Faye stands up from a cushy booth seat.

03:45:50 Katina Faye sits down on Ali Candan's lap.

03:46:17 Katina Faye gasps at Morris Corlew.

03:46:20 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "It might be good for the cause if I am. I'll go to jail for that if I have to. Will show them that I was willing to risk it to get through to them."

03:46:20 Ali Candan glances down at his watch momentarily.

03:46:23 Katina says to Morris, "May I have some peach?"

03:46:23 Morris says to Katina, "Hmm?"

03:46:33 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Peach tea."

03:46:35 Morris says to Katina, "Yeah."

03:46:37 Emily says to Sarah, "From the Torus restaurant."

03:46:40 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "But.. as far as Iknow, I haven't done anything illegal."

03:47:06 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Cykes said we'd be fine if we didn't say anything slanderous."

03:47:12 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "And you did not."

03:47:13 Morris Corlew just arrived.

03:47:14 Emily says to Eli, "Speaking your thoughts isn't a crime, as far as I know. Even if Best has a mentally defective view of that."

03:47:16 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "And nothing I said was a lie, so therefor is not slanderous."

03:47:16 Morris Corlew gives a closed can of peach iced tea to Katina Faye.

03:47:20 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:47:22 Lily says to Eli, "Nope you haven't. My theroy is Vernos made a big deal out of the Expedition even though his opinion is unfounded."

03:47:22 Morris Corlew gives a closed can of peach iced tea to Sarah Bellamy.

03:47:29 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "I also, never said anything about anyone in particular."

03:47:35 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:47:37 You say, "Well, we did lose our offices."

03:47:39 Morris Corlew says to Evangeline, "Peach, raspberry, lemon, or herbal?"

03:47:42 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

03:47:44 You say, "For stading there today."

03:47:45 Sarah Bellamy beams at Morris Corlew.

03:47:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep we were definitely debunked."

03:47:47 You say, "Stading."

03:47:47 Eli says to you, "And Vernos is Voice now."

03:47:48 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Peach please. Where do you get that tea?"

03:47:52 Emily says to Eli, "I'll go land there ahead of you. I'll yell if you're hauled off."

03:47:55 Emily Ford nods.

03:47:55 You nod to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:47:57 Katina says to Morris Corlew, "Thank you sir."

03:52:34 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "You did, but that's all right."

03:52:34 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Oh, Chippy's!"

03:52:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "It was sealed and the bari spread inside."

03:52:38 Cheri Lindbergh removes a small bag of Chippy's Chips from a black leather backpack with a brushed steel buckle.

03:52:42 Cheri Lindbergh gives a small bag of Chippy's Chips to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:52:47 Cheri Lindbergh says, "There you go, hero."

03:52:53 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "But it's all right. One mistake. One."

03:52:55 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "That's about the only thing they can call me out on."

03:52:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys asks, "Was there a photo of Grenwold?"

03:53:00 Morris Corlew says, "Still it was by another enemy of humanity."

03:53:03 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

03:53:04 Ted Warburton nods.

03:53:04 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Thanks!"

03:53:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah Eli has them."

03:53:12 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident puts a small bag of Chippy's Chips in a charcoal gray leather gadget bag.

03:53:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Ah."

03:53:16 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident gets a golden chip from a small bag of Chippy's Chips and chomps down on it.

03:53:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Unfortunately none of us took those out of the can."

03:53:19 Ted Warburton says, "Right, really is sleep time."

03:53:21 Ted Warburton stands up.

03:53:26 Ted Warburton says, "Later all."

03:53:27 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Should have left that one out I guess."

03:53:28 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident puts a mug in a small red trash can.

03:53:29 Morris Corlew waves to Ted Warburton.

03:53:32 Sarah Bellamy waves to Ted Warburton.

03:53:33 Ted Warburton waves.

03:53:34 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's all right."

03:53:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Ted Warburton.

03:53:37 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident removes a space imaging photograph of Aria VII from a purple canvas backpack.

03:53:39 Ted Warburton walks out.

03:53:40 Pierre-Louis says to Cheri, "Are we gonna go meet somenone?"

03:53:43 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh no wait that's mine."

03:53:43 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "It was still destroyed by someone the Accord helps fight."

03:53:50 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the vostok-class capsule "Capsicum" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

03:53:52 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident puts a space imaging photograph of Aria VII in a purple canvas backpack.

03:53:55 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident removes a silken tapestry of local space from a purple canvas backpack.

03:54:04 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "And taht is also mine.. hmm."

03:54:06 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, "Yes, it was still the enemies of humanity. I'll admit that I did forget to say IFs though."

03:54:07 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Gotta love Bests's nitpickin."

03:54:19 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Can we keep the space iamges eli, or would you like them back?"

03:54:23 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Images, too."

03:54:25 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "If that's all he can do is nitpick, he's in trouble."

03:54:30 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "If you would like them, you can have it."

03:54:37 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "Nah."

03:54:37 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

03:54:38 Katina Faye takes a sip from a can of peach iced tea.

03:54:38 Lily says to Evangeline, "If he wants them, I'll be happy to make you a poster."

03:54:42 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "I only took them for the purposes of the broadcast."

03:54:46 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident smiles at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Thanks."

03:54:56 "Sure!" Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

03:54:59 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "You go! I gotta sleep soon, so sleepy."

03:55:03 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Sure."

03:55:04 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident smiles at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:55:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys pats Cheri Lindbergh on the back.

03:55:08 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys gives Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident a thumbs up!

03:55:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

03:55:11 You hear Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident's metallic silver touch einrophone ringing.

03:55:13 Eli says to Pierre-Louis, "Did I save the AEU Pierre?"

03:55:13 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I will return later."

03:55:15 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident puts a silken tapestry of local space in a purple canvas backpack.

03:55:16 You hear Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident's metallic silver touch einrophone ringing.

03:55:17 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident grins at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:55:19 Pierre-Louis says to Eli, "Sure!"

03:55:21 You hear Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident's metallic silver touch einrophone ringing.

03:55:23 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident removes a metallic silver touch einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

03:55:25 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident unlocks a metallic silver touch einrophone with a swipe of his finger.

03:55:27 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident speaks into his metallic silver touch einrophone:

03:55:28 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Yeah?"

03:55:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Everyone else just need to process that."

03:55:30 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident removes a black t-shirt with a colorful map of local space on the front from a purple canvas backpack.

03:55:30 Cheri Lindbergh waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

03:55:37 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys waves to Cheri Lindbergh.

03:55:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys scrambles to his feet.

03:55:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves out.

03:55:43 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says into her dark metallic purple metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "You did, Keegs."

03:55:50 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident speaks into his metallic silver touch einrophone:

03:55:50 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh, ok yeah I'm coming now."

03:55:52 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the bullet "And Be Excited For Glorious Progress" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

03:56:00 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident speaks into his metallic silver touch einrophone:

03:56:00 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Alright folks.. Moment of truth. I'm going to go check my mail."

03:56:03 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Eli, Eva, Ather, Lily and Shule takin a stand."

03:56:05 Morris Corlew waves to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:56:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Sadly Keegan as we spoke up for Humanity."

03:56:12 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Emily will report if I get taken away."

03:56:14 You wave to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:56:16 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident touches the screen of a metallic silver touch einrophone, then swipes his finger across it to lock it.

03:56:16 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident places a metallic silver touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

03:56:21 You pat Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident on the back.

03:56:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:56:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident hugs Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:56:26 Morris says to Eli, "You'll be fine."

03:56:27 Sarah Bellamy waves to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:56:30 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thank all of you,  once again for all the support. It means so much to me."

03:56:35 Evangeline says to Eli, "You'll be fine and if you aren't, I'm coming to visit you."

03:56:36 Morris Corlew nods to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident. "Of course."

03:56:41 Sarah Bellamy nods to Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident.

03:56:45 Eli takes a dramatic bow and smiles.

03:56:50 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

03:56:54 Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident walks out.

03:56:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:56:57 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I never voted for him."

03:57:03 Morris says to Evangeline, "Just didn't vote?"

03:57:05 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

03:57:09 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope."

03:57:18 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't like voting. It makes things difficult."

03:57:18 Morris Corlew says, "Not to be mean...but that's just as bad."

03:57:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Nope that's not Democracy."

03:57:26 Morris Corlew asks, "Votin does?"

03:57:32 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sometimes."

03:58:02 Morris Corlew says, "I dunno...I imagine if all the folks who didn't vote had voted against Best, he wouldn'ta won."

03:58:05 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "The world voted for him, our people did. We thought he was going to be a good thing, but now he's taking away our freedoms so yeah, we made a stupid mistake and now, we want it to be undone, at least that is how I see it."

03:58:10 Morris Corlew says, "And we wouldn't be in this mess."

03:58:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

03:58:16 Nissi Valdaire says, "Always vote."

03:58:18 Sarah Bellamy nods to Morris Corlew.

03:58:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We had horrible choices."

03:58:28 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:58:41 Morris Corlew says, "I can't believe anybody thought he was gonna be a good thing. I mean he showed his true colors all through the election."

03:58:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't get it either."

03:59:07 Morris Corlew says, "Rebane or even Garner woulda been a much better choice."

03:59:13 Sarah Bellamy nods.

03:59:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well privitazation would have been bastardization and of course Garner wanted us gone."

03:59:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I had my reservations no doubt about all of them."

03:59:46 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says into her dark metallic purple metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "You did a good thing Eli. You made a point."

03:59:46 Morris Corlew asks, "Privatization wouldn't have killed the corps. And votin for your job over your conscience? Really?"

04:00:03 Sarah says to Morris, "Scuse me just a minute, I need the nearest potty chair."

04:00:05 Nissi Valdaire says, "I probably woulda voted for Garner and then tried to take action and prove him wrong about the corps. Or Rebane, just cuz she had her plan doesn't mean it definitely would've happened if it'd been fought. She's not insane like Best."

04:00:07 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "If all he can do is nitpick..."

04:00:12 Morris says to Sarah, "You use a potty chair?"

04:00:14 Morris Corlew looks at Sarah Bellamy thoughtfully.

04:00:21 Sarah Bellamy giggles.

04:00:23 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

04:00:24 Sarah Bellamy says, "Toilet, darlin."

04:00:26 Sarah Bellamy stands up from Morris Corlew's lap.

04:00:27 Lily says to Morris, "It sure would anything privitized is just another way of sending eveybody out on the last train."

04:00:33 Sarah Bellamy bebops out.

04:00:33 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Everybody."

04:00:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "Best was just the simple obvious answer. And life never has simple obvious answers."

04:00:36 Morris says to Lily, "No it ain't."

04:00:38 Katina Faye laughs.

04:00:47 Lily says to Morris, "Trust me it is."

04:00:49 Morris says to Lily, "Just means you might not've gotten all the government subsidies."

04:00:54 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I would have votedfor the woman, personally, but I'm parcial to women wh oknow what they want. She may have done well."

04:00:57 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

04:01:10 Morris Corlew grins at Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident. "I wish you woulda."

04:01:14 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

04:01:25 Lily says to Morris, "Yup on the lowest bidder."

04:01:29 Morris Corlew says, "Best was the obvious bad choice out of all three."

04:01:32 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I also wish I hadn't taken that super ass long vacation, but what can you do?"

04:01:39 Morris Corlew nods to Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

04:02:25 Morris Corlew says, "Sorry, but if we get options to elect a president, and the best one for the League wants to cut my job and the worst one wants to save it? Guess who I'm votin for? I'd rather be outta a job than send my alliance spiralin down the tubes."

04:03:06 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do have to say one thing."

04:04:08 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Ok. Good."

04:04:28 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "The AEU program is open again. For however long that is, I will be greatful, but it is open again. There was a time we only had three pilots at one time. I'mg lad the prgram is opened back up again, though with this latest blow... I don't know... I'm thinking out loud, at least. It means more people who can fight for what's right, and if we can get people... other people to back us, then it would be worth it. You all back us and we are so proud of you for helping us... And support. Thank you."

04:04:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a warm double chocolate chip cookie.

04:04:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a warm double chocolate chip cookie in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

04:04:43 You nod to Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

04:04:43 Morris Corlew says, "And in come the likes of Vermin Bailey."

04:04:51 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "We can't avoid that."

04:04:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah there's always one."

04:05:03 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm sugar cookie.

04:05:07 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course, the tests for the mintality should have caught it."

04:05:08 Katina Faye takes a sip from a can of peach iced tea.

04:05:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

04:05:11 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip from a can of peach iced tea.

04:05:13 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person fighter "Striker I".

04:05:26 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person Accord gemini "The Deadly Explorer".

04:05:28 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul".

04:05:29 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "Unles he can fool testing, which I pretty much thought he could, or if he was a spy for Best."

04:05:37 Kerry Rodriguez just arrived.

04:05:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:05:40 "They caught it." Morris Corlew chuckles. "He's a Best Fanboy. What did that press release say? Somethin bout Best loyalists."

04:05:40 Kerry Rodriguez sits down on a cushy booth seat.

04:05:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:05:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Cheers for Eli!

04:05:57 Morris Corlew says, "Best wants folks like Vermin in the corps."

04:05:59 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods. "Yes."

04:06:01 Kerry Rodriguez tosses his package in a nearby garbage can.

04:06:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:06:07 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her dark metallic purple metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

04:06:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yay!"

04:06:14 Morris Corlew says, "Folks could still get in before...but Vernos wouldn'ta made it."

04:06:17 Sarah Bellamy just arrived.

04:06:17 Ninja the little black CatBot trots happily in after Sarah Bellamy with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:06:24 Sarah Bellamy sits down on Morris Corlew's lap.

04:06:25 "Yes, he wouldn't have. They have become lax, then?" Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:06:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh yeah we wouldn't have had him."

04:06:45 "Of course." Morris Corlew shrugs. "It's not lax though. It's Best lettin his loyalists in by priority."

04:06:45 Kerry Rodriguez says, "Watching him move around over there had me on edge."

04:06:45 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the one-person fighter "Striker I" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

04:06:47 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "And I thought people like Tatiana were bad."

04:06:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.

04:07:02 Kerry Rodriguez says into his indigo metachannel FTL communicator, "Did you get out?"

04:07:07 "True, but how do we know that the people that are coming in now aren't his loyalist?" Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:07:14 Morris Corlew says, "You don't."

04:07:22 Morris Corlew says, "That's the point. Those are the folks Best wants in the corps."

04:07:23 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods. "I wish there was a way."

04:07:27 Nissi Valdaire says, "Assume they are or they probably wouldn't get in."

04:07:32 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person fighter "Striker I".

04:07:33 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

04:07:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "Vern was just under cover apparently."

04:07:38 Emily Ford just arrived.

04:07:43 Kerry Rodriguez says, "Hmm."

04:07:48 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident nods. "True."

04:07:49 Morris Corlew asks, "So which is better? Extreme vettin or a ton of Best loyalists?"

04:07:59 Kerry Rodriguez scrambles to his feet.

04:07:59 Kerry Rodriguez strides out.

04:08:00 Morris Corlew says, "That wanna make the AEU suck again."

04:08:05 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

04:08:14 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we all work together for a common cause? We won't suck."

04:08:25 Morris Corlew says, "And most of ya are."

04:08:33 Morris Corlew says, "But then there's Vernos, Anti-AEU."

04:08:33 Emily Ford says, "It's not as simple as that though."

04:08:39 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "But without vernos. Nod 'I know."

04:08:41 Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

04:08:41 Sarah Bellamy says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I always am."

04:08:44 Emily Ford says into her purple metachannel FTL communicator, "We taking the weasel?"

04:08:52 Katina Faye scrambles to her feet.

04:08:52 Katina Faye just went into the stairway to the garage.

04:08:56 Morris Corlew arches an eyebrow.

04:08:59 Keying her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, Sarah Bellamy laughs.

04:09:02 Morris says to Emily, "Taking the weasel?"

04:09:12 Kerry Rodriguez just arrived.

04:09:15 Emily Ford says, "It's okay, just prodding."

04:09:15 Kerry Rodriguez sits down on a cushy booth seat.

04:09:19 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

04:09:20 Emily Ford takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

04:09:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

04:09:34 Morris says to Emily, "Proddin with a vibro-baton?"

04:09:43 Sarah Bellamy grins.

04:09:47 Emily Ford says, "Don't put ideas in my head."

04:09:51 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:09:52 Morris Corlew pats a mirror finish chrome vibro-baton lightly.

04:09:52 You wave. "I'm going to go relax and try to calm down."

04:09:56 You stand up from a comfortable wooden chair.

04:09:58 Morris Corlew waves to you.

04:09:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have 7 lenses I need 5 more and I can craft a cannon just for him."

04:10:05 Sarah Bellamy waves to you.

04:10:06 Morris Corlew grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Same."

04:10:08 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]

04:10:08 The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul", the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 364", and the two-person light transport "Boiling Waters" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

04:10:10 The reactionless drive of the two-person light transport "Boiling Waters" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

04:10:10 [Manhattan Spaceport; Garage]

04:10:10 You can go up.

04:10:15 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

04:10:15 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:10:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

04:10:17 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

04:10:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:10:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:10:19 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:10:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

04:10:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:10:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:10:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:10:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:10:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:10:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

06:25:06 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

12:42:56 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

12:43:34 Lily says to you, "It's really worrisome that we no longer have a SDC at least. We really don't really need a gSL as critically but it's just irresponsible for them to have removed you from office particularly that you have been doing well in your job."

12:44:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What we've done has nothing to do with our functional responsibilities. I can see their removing Eli but especially not you."

12:52:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You should do likewise."

12:53:19 You say, "Well, originally, Ather was going to take the next term... but I don't know if he can run for office now."

12:53:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Unfortunately, roguing will probably prevent Eli and Ather that is unless they regain their status."

12:53:48 You say, "Oh really? Well, that answers my question."

12:56:00 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.

13:32:23 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:32:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:32:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:32:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:32:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:32:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:32:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:32:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:32:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:32:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:32:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:32:49 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

16:53:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-s

19:07:20 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
19:36:36 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

19:36:49 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

19:36:49 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:36:50 You exit the ship.

19:36:50 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

19:45:48 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

19:45:48 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" and the four-person light carrier "Kalina" are landed here.

20:07:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:07:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:07:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:07:37 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:07:40 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Kalina! Welcome to The Torus!"

20:07:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:08:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:08:25 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

20:08:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Kalina. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:08:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:08:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:08:45 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:11:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule, the clipper has an FTL drive, right?"

20:11:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Indeed."

20:15:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So we have a month to go with no space defense captain?"

20:15:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ugh Eli, not sure how you argued with these folks, I just spent about twenty minutes reminding the governmennt that this is a democracy and that folks have the right not to agree with Best."

20:18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "All they can come back with is how I'm being melodramic and that they know I've been under a great deal of stress..."

20:18:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just try not to anger them."

20:18:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The last thing we need is to have no voice."

20:19:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh I'm well on that path I am afraid, I pretty much told them I rather be rogued and labeled such than sit back and watch him burn the place."

20:32:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Constantine, I need you a moment."

20:32:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And Eli."

20:32:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Running an errand, give me a minute."

20:32:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Meet you at your office in 5?"

20:33:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yes, you can meet me in that terrible space."

20:34:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I have answers for those removed out of office and rogued."

20:34:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not sure why you think I need answers. It all seems pretty clear cut."

20:35:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well, I was right in your part, it was 50, 50."

20:35:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I was rogued for helping unregs and removed from office for doing the broadcast."

20:36:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And Shule and Lily were removed for the broadcast since it underminded the elected government position by creating a media circus."

20:36:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Guess they should have thought about that when we tried to go through official channels first."

20:37:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Perhaps if Best hadn't openly claimed that we all agreed with him, when our vote said we didn't. The broadcast wouldn't have had to be done."

20:37:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So then, who is truly responsible for a media circus?"

20:37:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The government also says that they are pretty sure everyone in office this term had dealings with unregs on some level before."

20:39:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I will come, out of respect for the office that you call so terrible, but don't expect me to speak. Ihave nothing to say to you in person right now."

20:40:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well, speech would be quite helpful."

21:03:15 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

21:03:15 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

21:03:21 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.

You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

21:03:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

21:03:32 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:03:36 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

21:03:36 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

21:03:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

21:03:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Did you get all of your ships Love?"

21:04:13 You nod. "The one sthat matter."

21:04:17 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:04:23 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

21:04:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok let's go see how the flow is. If it's not good, we'll have to wait."

21:04:40 You say, "Ok."

21:04:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

21:06:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:06:27 You say, "Let's go."

21:07:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:07:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:07:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:07:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:07:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:07:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:08:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Doing best I can Love."

21:08:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:08:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:08:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

21:08:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:08:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:08:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:08:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:08:12 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "William Dove, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

21:08:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Quantum Skim Accelerator to The Arm.

21:08:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:08:23 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:08:26 You say, "No problem."

21:08:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

21:08:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I took your Sightseer to The Torus."

21:08:48 You say, "|Thanks."

21:09:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:09:04 You feel the ship shudder slightly as it approaches a quantum skim accelerator.

21:09:08 The computer announces, "Initiating connection with The Arm's local quantum skim accelerator network."

21:09:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The others I didn't have room for at the time but we can get them later most likely."

21:09:21 You nod.

21:09:23 You say, "It's fine."

21:09:25 You grin.

21:09:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

21:09:34 The computer announces, "Connection established. Communicating between quantum skim acceleration gates now."

21:10:03 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initializing in five seconds."

21:10:05 The computer announces, "Four."

21:10:06 The computer announces, "Three."

21:10:07 The computer announces, "Two."

21:10:07 The computer announces, "One."

21:10:09 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initialized."

21:10:10 You feel the deck underneath you shudder violently, and you stumble slightly.

21:10:15 The shuddering finally settles down.

21:10:20 The computer announces, "Skim initialization complete."

21:13:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh ugh I forgot to check on the Scoop."

21:14:05 I don't understand that.

21:14:07 You say, "Oops."

21:14:32 The ship's current engine speed is 5079 km/s.

21:14:45 The computer announces, "Skim complete; starship has arrived at journey destination."

21:15:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So guess we can go back and check or wait it will likely still have a couple of days left so it may be that we'll have to come back by Sunday or so but we can always go back."

21:15:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:15:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Thousand Storms Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:15:46 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Thousand Storms Orbit."

21:15:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:15:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:15:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:15:51 A massive gas giant floats here, close to a bright white dwarf star. Its surface is aboil with whorls of cloud and angry red storm centers.

21:16:01 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:16:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

21:16:35 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 212.0, -8.0.

21:16:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

21:16:38 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

21:16:48 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

21:16:49 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:16:51 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

21:16:58 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

21:17:09 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

21:17:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."

21:17:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This isn't very good flow."

22:09:46 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

22:18:08 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

22:18:18 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

22:18:29 Lily winces.

22:18:46 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

22:18:46 A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain.
