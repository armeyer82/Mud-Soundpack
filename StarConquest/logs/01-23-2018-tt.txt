Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery
fireflies across the toes here.

Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Fixed an issue where enemies could retain memory of a companion dying despite
the encounter resetting.
   Posted 6 days, 9 hours, 52 minutes, and 26 seconds ago
-----
Tired of searching for which person is running League in your ground combat
squad? Want to know the energy of all the AEU suits in your team more easily? We
have news for you!
Introducing GROUND COMBAT ROLES!
Simply type the 'ROLE' command in a battlesuit to assign your battlesuit a
specific role that can be changed at any time. They give no real mechanical
benefit, but sorts your squad appropriately for the purposes of telling what's
what at a glance.
   Posted 5 days, 8 hours, 13 minutes, and 9 seconds ago
-----
The 'suitinfo' command now says what role a particular suit is, if one is
assigned.
   Posted 5 days, 7 hours, 59 minutes, and 55 seconds ago
-----
Ground Combat adjustment: Snap Shot (an ability in the 'Offense of the Clans'
module) now generates additional enmity, in keeping with their ability to
augment the squad's tanking capabilities.
   Posted 5 days, 4 hours, 22 minutes, and 55 seconds ago
-----
Also, the enmity generated by applying shields has been reduced.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Attention pilots: the tracking station that
was destroyed was apparently a tracking station on or orbiting hyperion.
Investigators are still investigating the wreckage, but say that there's nothing
we can do at the moment. I must personally caution you though, that this could
be a step towards occupation of Hyperion by outside forces. Such happened
several years back, when a Mule, which was at the time registered to a Mutuality
pilot landed droids fashioned by Agnar, as well as troops in specialized
battlesuits to help a group of Sepritists try to take over the planet. In that
situation, a building of hostages were taken, and when we went to try to free
them, they were all apparently killed. All this to say, remain vigilant, and be
ready in case we might have to launch to defend that region from possible attack
by any faction. [02:00 21 January 2318 GST]
There are two board posts.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is

to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
