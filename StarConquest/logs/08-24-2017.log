00:32:11 Minor Change: Several people demanded this, so we're here to deliver! There's now a succinct and informative help file on Mutuality politics!

00:32:36 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh I bet this will be an interesting read.

00:33:02 [MTTS] usfolks: Haha ha hahaha haha.

00:33:09 [MTTS] Ulias: Hahah, almost spit my soda out.

00:33:13 [MTTS] JSteele: Oh yes. It is very informative.

00:33:19 [MTTS] Squidmind: Why?

00:33:21 [MTTS] something: I had the impression Mutuality politics was who screamed the loudest during meetings, so yeah.

00:33:36 [MTTS] usfolks: So very informative. The most informative. It's a great help file. The best help file.

00:33:37 [MTTS] something: Oh hahaha.

00:33:41 [MTTS] something: I just read it.

00:33:45 [MTTS] atherj: Oh my gosh, why would there be a Mutuality politics help file. Who would possibly have requested this? Please give names.

00:33:46 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

00:33:59 [MTTS] something: Best help file.

00:34:12 [MTTS] atherj: Bah. You all have no taste when it comes to the best help files.

00:34:15 [MTTS] Squidmind: It's actually very accurate.

00:34:21 [MTTS] atherj: The best help file is help elk.

00:34:24 [MTTS] something: I'm honestly not surprised that is.

00:34:28 [MTTS] something: That it is.

00:34:35 [MTTS] usfolks: As are the ones about elk and ferns!

00:34:47 [MTTS] JSteele: I'm a big fan of `help me' as well.

00:34:59 [MTTS] usfolks: Same. And babies.

00:36:54 [MTTS] something: Babies in a sci phi game about flying starships make no sense.

00:36:59 [MTTS] something: Just putting that out there.

00:37:12 [MTTS] usfolks: I happen to agree, Something.

00:37:17 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

00:37:41 [MTTS] something: I can imagine it now. Alex, don't hit that button...the airlock has begun cycling, please wait.

00:38:08 [MTTS] Squidmind: Babies exist in the SC universe, they're just not going to show up for player use.

00:38:20 [MTTS] Butchulla: Oh please no. Babies do not belong in space games. Just my opinion.

00:38:24 [MTTS] usfolks: Thank everything we hold dear.

00:38:25 [MTTS] Butchulla: For players, I mean.

00:38:44 [MTTS] something: Yeah, of course they exist. I just meant flying around in things with car sized weapons while also having children around is the dumbest thing I could ever imagine.

00:38:55 [MTTS] atherj: You mean we aren't all clones, Squidmind? I feel extreme levels of disappointment.

00:38:56 [MTTS] JSteele: Hmm, player use. That sounds somewhat disturbing.

01:21:53 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:21:54 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:21:54 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:21:55 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:22:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:14:30 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:14:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

02:15:58 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "When the guy who owns the booth announced it on general, I of course went over to buy a bottle because I was curious. I um...Did not expect that result."

02:16:31 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "But Nicolette dosed a second one after she saw it mutilate the first."

02:16:37 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:16:37 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:16:38 You exit the ship.

02:16:39 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

02:16:43 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:16:43 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:16:44 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:16:44 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:16:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:16:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:16:46 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:16:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:16:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:16:53 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

02:16:58 The ship is already moving.

02:17:00 The ship is already moving.

02:17:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:17:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:17:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:17:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:17:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:17:08 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well then I guess it was the third, since I unknowingly dosed the first."

02:17:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:17:09 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:17:10 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:17:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:17:12 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

02:17:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:17:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:17:14 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:17:16 There are no other ships in the sector.

02:17:17 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

02:17:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:17:33 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

02:17:34 
AEU transport "Registered Merchant 143" departed to League sector Earthgate (Alpha-1) approximately 7 minutes ago.

02:17:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:17:36 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:17:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:17:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:17:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:17:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:17:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:28:10 [General Communication] 'Doc' Anatolius of Stavros transmits, "That would be possible from human DNA contamination to force a coincidental evolutionary response. Similar re-expression, except on a generational level, can be seen in the response of felo to bari."

02:28:16 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Come over to the lounge and look."

02:28:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah seems Morris formed his own org."

02:28:43 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "I have yet to see a felo grow bari parts that I'm aware of."

02:28:46 [General Communication] 'Doc' Anatolius of Stavros transmits, "I have already stated my reason for not being able to go to where you please."

02:28:58 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:29:05 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I believe she was talking to me. I also can't at this time, rifting."

02:29:05 You say, "Yeah, I wish him luck."

02:29:14 [General Communication] 'Doc' Anatolius of Stavros transmits, "The response that can be seen is that of felo to soldier felo."

02:29:23 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Doc, would a picture help any?"

02:29:24 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Sorry Doc, I was speaking to that other guy that hasn't seeen them."

02:29:40 [General Communication] 'Doc' Anatolius of Stavros transmits, "Certainly."

02:29:51 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:29:59 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes, but that's not a mimicry response. It's a...a defensive response. Sorry, I don't know scientific terms for what I mean. I hope ya get my meanin though."

02:29:59 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's just disturbing to see. Just, wow."

02:30:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:30:11 [General Communication] 'Doc' Anatolius of Stavros transmits, "I must return to work. Somebody needs antiviral agents."

02:30:25 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "I'll send ya a photo momentarily Doc."

02:30:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah, it's not going to be easy as there's nothing he can vassalize with."

02:30:51 You nod.

02:30:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He's in the same situation as Nicolette and Surf and Rune."

02:31:10 You say, "Exactly."

02:31:16 You say, "But he knows everything."

02:31:19 You chuckle.

02:31:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sure not going to invite him into 777. If LIBS does, then fine but he's been the one who has bashed our project from the beginning."

02:31:59 You exclaim, "Oh, please don't!"

02:31:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:32:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:32:04 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:32:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

02:32:14 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:32:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So perhaps he jsut likes being an organization of one."

02:32:32 You ask, "Can I invite him out to 777 so I can strand him out there?"

02:32:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Sure!"

02:32:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:32:45 You laugh.

02:32:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But first need to do that to Vernos."

02:32:54 You say, "Oh, right."

02:33:42 You say, "Shall I meet you back at the Torus? I came over here in my flare."

02:34:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh sure! I thought you wanted to be in your office which is why I was here. I also had to pickup mail."

02:34:51 You say, "Oh no, I just needed to check reports and such."

02:35:05 You say, "I'll meet you back there."

02:35:08 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:35:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ah ok. Yeah I checked my office and obviously, it's quiet."

02:35:13 You say to Lily, "I love you."

02:35:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:35:26 Lily says to you, "I love you too."

02:35:28 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:35:30 You wave.

02:35:33 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:35:33 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:35:34 You exit the ship.

02:35:34 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

02:35:50 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:35:50 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:35:51 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:35:51 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:35:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:35:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:35:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:35:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:35:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:36:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:36:17 Which sector did you mean?

02:36:17 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

02:36:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:36:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:36:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:36:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:36:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:36:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:36:27 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:36:27 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

02:36:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sec I need to check the scoop."

02:36:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:36:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:36:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:36:32 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:36:34 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:36:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok."

02:36:37 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

02:36:37 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:36:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:37:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:37:23 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:37:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:37:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:37:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:37:43 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:37:55 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:37:55 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:37:56 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:37:56 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:38:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just a little over 2 days on the scoop so we're ok."

02:42:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Stopping off at accord to check a couple of things. I'll be there soon Love."

02:43:32 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "All the felo that have been changed all came from the same ship, I'm fairly certain on this."

02:43:45 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You are incorrect."

02:43:51 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "As usual."

02:44:03 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Leave him alone."

02:44:32 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes but they were all felo that Eve was in regular contact with right?"

02:44:50 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Not sure that much matters if it was her genetic material used in the tonic."

02:45:08 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Physical contact? I don't pet every single felo I have."

02:46:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But if Nicolette got her felo from my ships on chetumal. There are 2 she could have got them from. Mine was from a different. Little ship."

02:46:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But you're around them a lot, we shed DNA all over the place."

02:46:52 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "She gave her stuff to Doc. It's not to do with where they were nabbed."

02:46:52 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "I got a feelin that even if they'd come from a ship of mine Eve ain't never set foot on they'd be this away 'cause of what Doc said."

02:47:15 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "We can try one."

02:47:20 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "No."

02:47:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's the thing Mel. I didn't hand over any samples, of anything of me."

02:47:26 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "You ain't touchin my felo."

02:47:38 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Eve, easy enough to grab DNA offa somethin ya touched."

02:47:41 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Get me one of those staring ones that you breed for its weird traits. Then talk to me about giving tonic to these."

02:47:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don' thave any that have just been in my ships alone."

02:48:01 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh I thought Nicolette said you did."

02:48:05 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah I understand that. But I was just explaining that I didn't like. Clearly hand over a sample or something."

02:48:07 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a difference Nicolette. That tonic don't change nothin but make 'em healthier."

02:48:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Greetings, AEU."

02:48:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Dak."

02:48:33 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "How does it make them healthier? You don't really know what it does."

02:48:37 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "It took away one's hummin...in addition to givin it human skin, eyes, and feet."

02:48:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good day all."

02:48:48 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "They live longer than a week, don't they?"

02:48:55 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "If you're so confident that it makes them healthier, take some yourself."

02:49:02 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "And it don't make 'em abominations."

02:49:22 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "I ain't drinkin some liquid that ain't meant for humans to satisfy you're morbid curiosity Nicolette."

02:49:42 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "An abomination in the eye of the beholder. The felo is, as I've stated, perfectly fine. Healthy and well-adjusted."

02:50:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, cool."

02:50:03 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:50:03 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:50:04 You exit the ship.

02:50:04 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

02:50:07 Board what?

02:50:09 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, sure looks well-adjusted to me. The one is mean as I dunno what and the other one lost its ability to hum."

02:50:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:51:47 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Alko, would you come to the Old Earth lounge please? I'd rather give this tael to ya in person."

02:52:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nicolette, that mean one that I saw. Was it mean before you gave it the tonic?"

02:52:44 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I assume so but didn't check. I aws looking for a kitten, I found one and took it."

02:53:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Which ship did you take it from again? I'm trying to figure out the chances."

02:53:56 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Seemingly, if the tonic made it mean, it would make all of them mean, and that doesn't appear to be one of its characteristics."

02:54:07 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Not necessarily."

02:54:19 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Thank you, doctor Corlew."

02:54:51 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Just 'cause one person's allergic to shrimp don't mean everybody else'll have the same reaction."

02:54:55 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If it was the tug. I've had a few mean ones on there lately. So the chances are high. If it was the transport. I only had a maned. A few months ago. So the chances are lower."

02:55:08 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Do you still need a guinea pig for the tonic on people? I'm kinda thirsty anyway."

02:55:14 [General Communication] Okinaj chuckles.

02:55:17 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh god."

02:55:34 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Please tell me you're jokin uh...Oknaji?"

02:55:50 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Err...Okinaj?"

02:55:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Tell me you're kidding. Please sanity."

02:55:56 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "One way to find out."

02:56:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Drinking strange,  possibly body-altering liquids is not recommended."

02:56:17 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Is that not exactly what Evenia wants to do?"

02:56:19 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident has used 4 megacredits on a long range laser module and placed it aboard the four-person Accord space module transport "SEAS Spare Parts".

02:56:20 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "People have done it before."

02:56:23 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."

02:56:30 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Never stopped pilotes."

02:56:34 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "She wants to look like an Outsider."

02:56:54 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "We get drinkable liquids from megapods on occasion that are quite drinkable."

02:57:00 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "So long as I don't grow a third arm or leg... wait, would that be a thing? I could do so much more stuff with a third arm."

02:57:04 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "This, of course, is why they're drinkable."

02:57:09 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "You might."

02:57:20 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "But that third arm might be covered in slime and teeth."

02:57:26 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Just imagine the potential: I can tri-hi-five."

02:57:36 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Having more arms seems good, if they are fonctionnal."

02:57:59 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Seriously though, if it'll settle this, I'm down."

02:58:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I mean Eli got his skin from bad salad that had mutagen in it. So just take a look at Eli. He got off lightly. His wasn't intentional."

02:59:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The salad wasn't bad, just the salad dressing."

02:59:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

02:59:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well yeah, that's what I meant."

02:59:40 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "So, where am I heading?"

02:59:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My apologies for insulting what was probably a delicious salad...for a while."

03:00:07 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I have more trust in weird liquid finely created by good Doc then one that was in a bari pod for a long time."

03:00:24 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I have no trust for either."

03:00:44 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, that's what I was going to say, Mel."

03:01:04 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I have great trust in it, but I did not say I would drink it."

03:01:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok loaded a new Long-Range a little prematurely but it's ok as I want to maintain a good complementof modules on there."

03:01:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, cool."

03:01:42 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Okinaj. I can't in good conscience tell you where to get the stuff. Because I don't want to imagine someone drinking it."

03:01:51 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It is on Helios."

03:01:57 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I may drink some, one of these days."

03:02:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thanks for putting up the new charging station."

03:02:09 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Probably not today, but someday."

03:02:14 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Wonder if this secret sauce tastes like grape? Cherry?"

03:02:26 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "This place has gone mad."

03:02:26 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Probably tastes like Eve."

03:02:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Um."

03:02:35 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Oh my god."

03:02:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That is drastically disturbing."

03:02:50 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "If AEU cadet is dumb enough to drink it, by all means."

03:02:58 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Can't said I've tasted Eve, but it can't be too bad, right?"

03:03:06 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "Umm."

03:03:16 [General Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Wait for it."

03:03:22 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I'm told that the only reason the person who drank it retired was because she couldn't handle how it made her look. Since that doesn't concern me, as long as I could still function properly in all the ways I need to be able to function, I'd be fine with it."

03:03:31 You can't go that way.

03:03:32 [General Communication] SPCF Member Morris Corlew transmits, "I wouldn't know..."

03:03:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:03:33 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:03:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a small purple trash bin, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

WHAT IS THE LAW?

For the most part, pilots must follow the same rules as the average citizen. These rules are mostly what you would expect: don't steal, don't litter, don't assault people, don't run naked through the streets, and so on. Common sense applies. Usually, a subsection of civil law written specifically for pilots and their unique circumstances details how to handle any offenses.

EAOS, AEU, and League have an open system of laws which citizens have full access to, though of course it often requires a lawyer to interpret them properly. The Fringe still have many laws on the book from their days as a parliamentary republic; however, citizens are understood to be under martial law and loyalty is enforced. In other words, Fringe citizens should not presume to have the right to free speech, and lack many of what one might be inclined to call "basic rights."

The Mutuality is even more different and subscribes to the Free Port Doctrine, a large document that enforces free trade and the right for all ships to seek safe harbor. While violations of the Free Port Doctrine are taken very seriously, the Mutuality lacks most of the morality-based laws that other alliances still have on the books.

VIOLATING THE LAW

Violating the law can have a number of possible effects. Minor offenses are usually met with fines, generally small by pilot standards. More serious offenses will usually result in a stay in jail (more on this below). However, because alliances have an interest in keeping pilots free, active, and making money, they will usually arrange for any stay behind bars to be relatively short. Only in very exceptional circumstances will a government press charges against its own pilots and take them to court, and usually these circumstances will also result in the pilots losing their licenses.

Fines and stays in jail should not be interpreted as punishments from the staff. You, via your character, will have made the decision to violate the law, and the world in which your character lives will react in a sensible manner. Disobedience should be a conscious choice as part of your character's arc, and dealing with (or trying to avoid) the resulting punishment should become part of his or her story. Getting thrown in jail does not necessarily mean that the staff want you to stop what you're doing (although your actions may begin to not make sense for a pilot -- more on this below). You can roleplay through bad times too!

THE NATURE OF PRISON

By interalliance agreement, pilots experience their jail time at Corbin Memorial Prison, a high-security prison on the airless moon Dure. However, because the facility is also easily accessed by free pilots, any pilots (or ex-pilots) who are sentenced to serve time in prison will be moved to another high-security facility within their alliance. Otherwise, pilots are only in jail at Dure until their court date, or, far more often, until their government decides to spring them.

Remember, jail is not a punishment from the staff! To this end, the jail environment is fairly immersive and certainly more than just a single cell that you wait within. Corbin Memorial Prison enjoys long hours of prisoner free time, during which inmates can roam the facility, exercise, eat delicious gruel, shower, and receive visitors. The jail even allows its inmates to send and receive mail (after it has been screened, of course). If your character ever ends up in jail, please feel free to leave your cell and explore the facility.

FURTHER PUNISHMENT

Pilots are often regarded in popular culture as something between ultra-rich celebrities and roguish scoundrels, and the media loves to see them in trouble. While the media, legally, cannot lie (except for the tabloids), they are not obliged to show any pilot in a favorable light. If you've done something wrong, particularly if you're in a position of leadership, expect it to receive some attention.

Also, remember that pilots must be psychologically fit to serve their alliance. If you randomly punch a technician in the face, get sent to jail, then randomly punch a guard in the face, your government may begin to wonder just what is wrong with you and whether you can still serve them. This may result in a visit 
05:26:59 from a psychologist or, if the behavior persists, there may be no choice but to revoke your character's pilot license. (Note: You, as the player, will be talked to by the staff before this happens.) Also, it's important to remain consistent with your profile -- people are fond of submitting profiles describing themselves as kind and peace-loving, then they go on to try to knock out the nearest NPC. This sort of inconsistency may require you to revise your character concept.

Again, though, violations of the law should be a conscious decision on the part of you, as the player, in order to tell your character's story. The punishment that your character receives will then be a sensible response by the world that he or she inhabits. This should not be confused with the staff punishing you, the player.

If your character has gotten into trouble and you aren't sure what to do, please use the SUPPORT command to speak with the staff.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

11:28:04 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a small purple trash bin here.

You can go out and enter into the ship.

11:30:09 You exit the ship.

11:30:09 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

11:30:12 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

11:30:13 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

11:30:13 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

11:30:14 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

11:30:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:30:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:30:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:30:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

11:30:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:30:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:30:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:30:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:30:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

11:30:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:30:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:30:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:30:40 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:30:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

11:30:41 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

11:30:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:30:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:30:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:30:45 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

11:30:48 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

11:30:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:31:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:31:01 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

11:31:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

11:31:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:31:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:31:16 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:31:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:31:18 You scramble to your feet.

A large golden soldier felo kitten stares curiously up at you.

11:31:29 [Starship "Effervescent Zephyr"; Control Room]

11:31:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

(You finish reading.)

11:35:34 You grab a large rubber stamp, pound it onto the 08:00 24/08 AEU space defense report, then fling the document into the Outgoing pile.

11:35:36 I see no "report" here.

11:35:38 You grab the door handle as you leave.

11:35:38 The door to the west suddenly closes.

11:40:32 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

11:40:32 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

11:40:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

11:40:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:40:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:40:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

11:40:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth to New Earth Orbit flight control, AEU corvette launching."

11:40:51 The ship is already moving.

11:40:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:40:53 Which sector did you mean?

11:40:53 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

11:40:54 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:40:54 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:40:55 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

11:40:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:40:58 You switch a flight control scanner off.

11:41:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:41:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:41:01 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:41:02 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

11:41:07 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

11:41:09 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

11:45:36 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:45:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

11:45:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:45:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:47:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:47:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:47:01 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

11:47:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:47:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:47:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:47:07 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:47:08 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

11:47:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:47:10 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

11:47:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:47:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:47:12 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

11:47:15 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Kalina! Welcome to home space!"

11:47:18 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

11:47:18 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

11:47:21 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:47:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:47:54 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

11:47:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalina. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

11:47:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:48:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:48:12 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:48:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:48:14 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

11:48:14 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

11:48:15 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 585", the four-person mule "Lion's Den", and the four-person light carrier "Kalina" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

11:48:30 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

11:48:45 Your ship 'Kalina' has been automatically moved into a garage.

11:57:25 Automatic daily maintenance is now underway. This will not affect your connectivity, but the game may feel less responsive for the next few minutes.

12:04:58 Automatic daily maintenance is complete.

12:15:26 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

12:44:18 Not much to see out there.

12:44:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:44:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

19:58:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:58:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:58:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:58:07 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

21:19:25 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:19:25 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:12:10 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Gate flight control, this is Providence Station, we detect an AEU corvette inbound."
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:12:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:12:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

22:37:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:37:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:37:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:37:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:37:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:37:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:37:46 There appear to be 18 pilots recently active.

22:49:49 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

22:49:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:49:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:49:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:49:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:49:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
