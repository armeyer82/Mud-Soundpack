-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a
compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on an overstuffed dark green chair.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Dear Nissi,
Around midnight on September 26, a call went out over tactical indicating that Chet's was being sieged. Morris called for crew at Old Earth and as I was still discussing it with others, I did not have
time to respond before the crew filled up. Choosing to respond in my flare, I went directly over to Chet's Bar and Grill. By the time I made it there, Morris was already there in his hammerhead and
informed me that they got it. I responded over general sector that I was there to help and that he always called me off.
I have to say that this is not the first time  he has done this. On another occasion many months back, a call went out over tactical indicating that a League sector was on alert. Since I was already in my
ship, I arrived and reported on the situation indicating I was already there. Morris called me off again and didn't even offer me so much as a thank you for staying to help defend League space.
Returning to the events of September 26th, another call went out over tactical indicating that Dusty Reaches had pirates there. I announced over tactical that I was on my way and would check it out.
Having formed my crew, I headed over to Dusty Reaches to check it out and while I was on my way, someone else reported the number of ships. I stayed with my crew to fight.
Now, during the course of the battle, the League cruiser fired on my ship. When Lily asked people over tactical to watch their locks, Morris responded something along the lines of "Sorry we hurt your
pretty little ship..
*
This indicates to me that Morris had no regrets about hitting a civilian ship of an alliance with which the League has a non-aggression Pact. Accidental weapon hits is one thing and we would have brushed
it off if he had apologized and not made a comment like that. I have never intentionally fired on a League ship and most certainly do not get upset if League ships respond to help defend human alliance
space. However, he should be warned that if this type of incident happens again and he responds in a like manner, we may not consider it accidental and more than likely consider it a violation of the NAP
between the AEU and the League. Thank you for your consideration in this matter.
Best Regards,
Shule Elemmire

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side,
with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel
panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships
between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek
glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway
leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red
insulated cooler here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new
starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel
doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the
rest of the spaceport.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner", the four-person mule "Lion's Den", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.

GUIDELINES
--
The Space Defense Captain is a very important position. Although the pilot corps is not military, and although you are not actually in command of it, your corps elected you as Captain because they feel
you are best qualified to organize the defense of their space. This is what they will expect you to do, and this is what your government will expect you to do.
You are not Captain just to fly big warships into battle (although that may often be the best way to handle a situation). The Captain is an organizational and a leadership position. When invaders come,
you are the one with a plan. Even if you are not available to be in space at the moment, you are the one who created the plan that your fellow pilots now implement without you. You are not THE defender of
the alliance. You help your alliance defend itself.
Your office terminal allows you several tools to help you organize a defense. First and most obviously, your terminal is hooked into the alliance's tactical sensors. This is similar to your public flight
control scanner, but provides more detailed information for every sector held by your alliance. You may also view sector starmaps from your office, any sector belonging to your alliance as well as any
sector your alliance has a ship in. Finally, you may send messages to all ships of your alliance, and your terminal will receive communications in reply.
Starship combat is not easy. While the Industrial Whip encourages and teaches pilots to be more productive, your role is to encourage and teach pilots to fight effectively in their own defense. Make
yourself available to assist others, and create plans that your fellow pilots can implement with or without you. One hero cannot defend an entire alliance.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red
insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule, I got a letter from Nissi."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know Morris acts like a jerk a lot, but if we avoid it, we should try to keep this from escalating to a non-aggression pact issue."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "With what's been going on with the Mutuality we don't want to add more fuel to the fire."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "If we can avoid it, I meant."
tr org I'm not the one trying to escalate it to a violation of the non-aggression pact. I did not track or have you fire on his ship yesterday nor will I ever until they break it. I will not be the one to
make the first offense.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not the one trying to escalate it to a violation of the non-aggression pact. I did not track or have you fire on his
ship yesterday nor will I ever until they break it. I will not be the one to make the first offense."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know it was him that hit you, but maybe he didn't do it on purpose, you know?"
tr org Is that basically what she said?
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Is that basically what she said?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Once I responded to a sector alert with Jacob Smitt, and were both in fighters, and I accidentally locked onto him and shot at him a couple
times before I realized it."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I said I was sorry and it was all good."
tr org Ok, but sarcastic remarks aren't the best things to say during that kind of accident.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, but sarcastic remarks aren't the best things to say during that kind of accident."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I agree."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "He shouldn't have been so flippant about it."
tr org Exactly
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "100%, you're right. But I think what Nissi's worried about, and I can see where she's coming from, is that a personal feud might escalate
and increase tensions between the AEU and league."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And we really don't need that, especially right now."
tr org I agree, but my ob is to look out for the welfare of our pilots.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree, but my ob is to look out for the welfare of our pilots."
tr org job too.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Job too."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I understand that."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hate to say it, but I think it might be a little bit more on us to make sure we maintain good relations. Everyone is on edge about the
action the fleet took against the mutuality, and any kind of threats are going to look like more warmongering."
tr org And I don't need our pilots, responding to  space combat situation and being worried that Morris's ship is going to fire on them and be rude about it.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And I don't need our pilots, responding to space combat situation and being worried that Morris's ship is going to fire on
them and be rude about it."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just something to think about."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I do see you point. Nissi said she talked to him about it, and I do believe her."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't dealt with her much, but I think we can take her at her word."
tr org Lily and I responded in order to try to show that we were willing to help defend the Mutuality. Morris interfered in that.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Lily and I responded in order to try to show that we were willing to help defend the Mutuality. Morris interfered in that."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And you guys were totally in the right to do so."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm glad you did."
tr org Ok, that's all I ask. It's fine if she talked to him about it and I believe her too.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, that's all I ask. It's fine if she talked to him about it and I believe her too."
tr org Next time, I'm just going to stay in the sector and help defend the Mutuality. Screw what Morris says.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Next time, I'm just going to stay in the sector and help defend the Mutuality. Screw what Morris says."
tr org The AEU civilian pilots need to at least show that we're willing to defend the Mutuality. 
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The AEU civilian pilots need to at least show that we're willing to defend the Mutuality."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think that would be fine. I agree that any other League pilot responding would have been happy to have the help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh Ather, you got your status back, great."
tr org I agree. Heck, I have no problem if other pilots show up to help defend the AEU. Just as long as when we go help to defend their space, they don't shoo us away like annoying little` flies.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli asked me yesterday to ask them to restore it."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I agree. Heck, I have no problem if other pilots show up to help defend the AEU. Just as long as when we go help to defend

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I won't apply for the next term, though, for what that's worth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I just nominated myself for the next term. Time to undo a few things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good to hear it."

With the end of the AEU Pilot Corps strike, Space invaders at least, will once again participate in the building of temporary stations. All station builders who have access to invaders warehouse are free
to send me letters asking for any parts that they might need, if they're not in the warehouse already. If there is a station builder who I overlooked for the access list, send me a letter notifying me, so
that I can add you as well.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick
bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one
location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship,
but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating
the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board,
providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status.
Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working
surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is
spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the
room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not
receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Shule:
You say yourself that you did not respond on tactical when Cheri, a member of the alliance that was being sieged, called for help. This is a matter of courtesy. Pilots keep each other informed when
responding to invasions. To not try to join the crew that was already forming and to instead jump in unannounced shows that there is no spirit of cooperation there. It's also courteous for other alliances
to keep the alliance under attack informed over tactical when they intend to respond. Especially when the responding ship has no diplomatic relations with the owner of the space it's entering.
Morris tells me that the response he gave to your ship was "We got it." No doubt he was terse, but this is a good example of keeping another pilot informed about the status of things. It was not a demand
that you leave. Again there is a lack of courtesy on both sides here. Silently refusing to join the crew already forming and taking your own ship instead doesn't make it look like we're working together,
so maybe a terse reply when you jump in unannounced is understandable.
As I said recently about a completely different incident, if you and Lily want to change the impressions people have about you, making a more honest effort to work with others would be step one. And yes,
I have also spoken to Morris about how he could do better too.
As for the hit you took, let me put my SDC hat on for a minute here. I was on that ship, and Morris said several times to watch our fire and not take potshots since there were multiple friendly ships
around. It is possible for a ship to track the wrong target and for the gunners to fire at it, but several things need to go wrong for that to happen. What happens instead, 99 times out of 100, is that
the enemy target evades and a friendly ship flies into their coordinates just in time to take the hit. In other words friendly fire usually results from the actions of the victim and is actually
unavoidable on the part of the ship that did the shooting. But nobody can keep track of every enemy ship's position and so it ends up being nobody's fault. This sort of friendly fire is very very common
and to try to make it out to be a deliberate act is very disingenuous.
Which brings me to the last part of your letter. The League doesn't respond well to threats and I hope you had the backing of your Voice when you made them. If you want to try to turn this personal feud
into an interalliance incident, that will be on you. Personally I think the AEU has already isolated itself enough, but I know you and Lily will do what you feel is best.

Please define extremely uncooperative behavior. The only station we put up during the strike was the Beacon in 777. I accomodated Morris when you asked me not to include him because he pressured me. So
please provide me a detailed explanation and list of how we've been uncooperative to support your justifications. Otherwise, SEAS will certainly be maintaining their own income-producing stations. So if
you don't like the competition, which won't be that great, then please cooperate with us in return. I look forward to your detailed report. - Lily Kaise

Lily:
This letter is an example of uncooperative behavior. So is the example you named. So are the issues Morris and Evenia and Melinda have communicated to me which I'm sure you're familiar with. But here's
what it comes down to.
I don't report to you. No one except the people in your own org need to report to you. We're supposed to be in this together. This attitude you guys are stewing in has to change or you will continue to
find yourselves isolated. Get out of the bubble you're in, talk to people, and clear the air. Otherwise nothing is going to change and I'll just wish you good luck with your solo endeavors.

Nissi, I believe the converse is quite the case here. I wouldn't back up my starship and offload modules which were provided to cooperatively work together on a project without first notifying the
affected party that I wanted to end our business arrangements. I would also show common courtessy to a party who wrote to me asking me why I had engaged in a certain action and respond to them. It may be
uncomfortable but here is a situation where Evenia chose to take matters into her own hands. I had written to Evenia and to Johann and neither responded. I also wrote to Melinda who didn't respond. This
was before I had any idea that Ather had asked that we be removed from station participation. I think it's you all who want to exist in your own bubble as we're certainly willing to deal. When I went to
put up the beacon in 777, I had no idea that the protest was going forward. I also had about an hour to be available and then a little time later on and I was caught between Johann being demanding and
what Eli wanted to do. As I have stated, I thought this was going to occur the day before when I was here at work. The rest of that week, I wasn't able to come into work until the weekend and Eli was
finished with this phase. So it's nothing to do with deliberately wanting to be uncooperative. I simply could not be in two places at once nor please everyone at once. I did more than the majority of AEU
pilots during the strike. I have morris's letters as I keep letters when there is an issue.

Hi Constantine, tomorrow, Thursday after midnight or on Friday after Midnight, we're going to meet with Nissi Valdaire and Melinda Michaels to make an attempt to come to some consensus concerning our
being allowed to participate on Temporary Space Stations. As you read on that rant of Melinda's on General, she claims we've been uncooperative. Yet, so far, we've had nothing to be uncooperative about!
So this is to try to clear the air. This also may have to do with the conflict between shule and Morris but Morris is clearly in the wrong here and he has no basis to dictate to others who arrive to
provide assistance. We were the first to show in Chet's Grill and as you know, in the other sector, his ship fired on Shules. Also, someone fired on our Navy from Eli's Pulsar while in B-19 the other
morning as well. Morris's nasy behavior was unwarranted as all that I said was 'please watch your fire'. At any rate, you know how I am. I will not beg anyone but I am reasonable and if anyone presents a
reasonable offer, I will generally accept it. I also told Nissi that until we met, that we would not establish any income-producing stations. Personally, I do not hold out a lot of hope that they will
deal. However, at least they cannot claim that we are as uncooperative as they would like to think. - Lily

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly
larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set
of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink
fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small white dragonflies, a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered on the left front pocket, and a pair of
white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a star print mandolin case. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus.
This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the
ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus.
This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Herding Cats. Welcome to Accord space."

larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set
of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink
fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small white dragonflies and a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered on the left front pocket. She is also
wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold
ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a star print mandolin case. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
