Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Happy"; Living Quarters]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging
Eatery & Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.
You see a long plasteel counter, a glossy pink ceramic felo chow bowl, a white
four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple
hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets,
a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and
a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large square purple and light purple
cloth rug, and a pair of soft mystic purple slippers here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

Shule and I would certainly enjoy a visit to Feng Wo. however given Nissi's
nonstop trek back out here to fetch us, i'd say it's up to Nissi if she is even
up to the task. Otherwise, will be here prior to 2359 today. I have been
monitoring the Hyperwave so if anything new develops, please repeat it a couple
of times as may be outside grabbign a prize!

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Crystal clear water fills the fishbowl, and a layer of gravel on the floor
creates a natural looking substrate. A bubbling plastic treasure chest in the
center is guarded by a plastic diver wearing a diving bell, and a kelp-like neon

several tetras inhabit the fishbowl, along with a snail. A standalone starmap
viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is
on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside
the riftflow.

smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust
of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights

that I'd had since I was a cadet, is probably gone now. She was old when we
left."

Evenia Callseah says, "Got her as a cadet. I wonder if her being armored has
something to do with it."
Evenia Callseah says, "That's what she's had most of her life."
Lily Kaise says, "None of mine lasted more than about 13 months but yeah I had
one which was a violet long-haired named Prissy. I guess she had a couple of
weeks left so I am sure she is gone now."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly

Ather Jammoa says, "Then yeah, not surprised it lived for that long. They
usually live longer on nutrigel, cause it's apparently closest to the fruits
that they use to eat."
Nicolette Lawrence says, "Maned don't last long, I've determined this. Ridged
don't appear to either."
Ather Jammoa says, "Love maned felo."
Lily Kaise says, "Oh well perhaps I'll start getting nutrigel for them."
Ather Jammoa says, "Best fighters against bari."
Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. That's what I'd heard, and it seems to be true. I
can't believe how long she lived."
Evenia Callseah says, "I love maned. Used to breed them."
Ather Jammoa nods.
Ather Jammoa says, "I use to breed them too, back in the day."
Ather Jammoa says, "The cuts and scrapes were always well worth it."
Eli Grey says, "I still find it strange that something that is such an efficient
predator has a fruit as it's favored food source."
Ather Jammoa says, "Sometimes when I felt particularly adventurous, and when a
non-maned felo was born into the herd, I'd let them tear it apart. Other times,
I decided to show mercy."
"They are." Evenia Callseah grins. "I mean those fuckers jump up and kick you in
the face. I respect that."
Ather says to Eli, "Well."
Ather says to Eli, "Most of them were never spacebound."
Ather Jammoa says, "And I still think that the EAOS modified the felo that we're
dealing with now."
Ather Jammoa says, "A lot."
cuddle lily
You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.
Evenia Callseah nods.
Ather Jammoa says, "For one, they have a much shorter lifespan than I
remembered."
Lily Kaise nods.
Evenia Callseah asks, "You mean the wild ones?"
Damien Alexander tramps in.
Ather Jammoa says, "Part of that could be due to their diet, but not all of it."
Ather Jammoa nods to Evenia Callseah.
Damien Alexander waves.
Eli Grey says, "That fruit must be a truly worthy prewave."
Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. They live maybe...2 weeks all told."
Eli Grey waves.
Eli Grey coughs.
Ather says to Evenia, "Two months tops if you keep them on nutrigel the entire
time."
Evenia Callseah waves.
Lily Kaise says, "Well all of mine now just get bulk chow since we can still buy
it over on the Torus but in a couple of weeks, who knows."
Evenia says to Ather, "Oh fuck that nonsense. Hard enough to get people together
for megapods to feed my pets."
Damien Alexander asks, "How's things?"
Evenia Callseah says, "Slow. Very slow."
Ather Jammoa says, "Hard enough to ge tpeople together for megapod raids
regardless. Especially since..6 years later, we're still scouting the thing,
because the EAOS are too busy working out how to break into a ship that they've
had for almost ten years."
Nicolette Lawrence says, "Slow."
Lily Kaise says, "Wow mine only live about a week if they are lucky."
wave damien
You wave to Damien Alexander.
Lily Kaise says, "Maybe two."
Evenia Callseah says, "I'm gonna need one so damn bad when we get back. I put
down 4 dispensers, but still."
The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.
Eli Grey smirks. "At least they might start making some faster progress on that
ship with the defense systems down."
Evenia Callseah nods to Eli Grey.
Lily says to you, "Guess we'll be running ours too and pumping up the bari
killing!"
Ather says to Eli, "Or something."
Damien says to Evenia, "Looks like it."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Evenia says to Damien, "And it continues to slow down. We'll thank Ather because
he last charted."
Lily Kaise stands up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple
throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.
Lily Kaise glides down.
Ather Jammoa says, "It hasn't been a cakewalk. I know a few folks have been
killed trying to get into the thing, and there were serious injurries, too."
Damien Alexander asks, "How far out are we?"
Ather Jammoa asks, "But, ten years?"
Ather Jammoa points at a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From
the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa".
[PA] Lily Kaise: "Drive is still all right too."
Lily Kaise glides in from below.
Evenia says to Damien, "About 9 LTC's, last chart."
Lily Kaise sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw
pillow with thick silver fringe on it.
smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise smiles at you.
Evenia Callseah says, "At least he didn't throw light-years at us."
Evenia Callseah grins.
Eli says to Evenia, "48 lightyears."
Evenia Callseah looks at Eli Grey and shrugs. "Whatever you say, weird
light-year person."
Eli Grey says, "2 lightdays, 2 lightminutes."
Damien Alexander glances down at his wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.
Ather says to Eli, "I think you have your lightyears crossed."
Ather Jammoa says, "You're way off."
Eli Grey grins. "I was just spouting off random distances to annoy Evenia."
Ather Jammoa says, "Oh."
Ather Jammoa nods.
Ather Jammoa says, "I'm about to say, you're just under 30 lightyears off."
Evenia Callseah says, "Hate light-years."
Evenia Callseah glares at Eli Grey.
Eli says to Evenia, "Lighthours."
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
Evenia says to Eli, "Your face is a light-hour."
Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat
every surface.
Ather says to Eli, "Give me your felo pet so I can see if Skipper will eat it."
Damien Alexander shakes his head. "I'm too used to LTCs to have any use fer
light-years."
Eli says to Evenia, "Go jump through a hole on Drydock."
Ather Jammoa says, "If she hasn't gone through the hole on Drydock she's not a
good pilot."
Eli Grey chuckles.
Eli Grey says, "I didn't bring any of my pets."
Ather Jammoa says, "All the cool people go through the hole on drydock. It's a
right of passage."
Damien says to Evenia, "I'd come hoover you up if you did."
Evenia Callseah chuckles.
Evenia Callseah says, "Of course I did that."
Evenia Callseah giggles.
Evenia says to Eli, "Don't let him choose, he'll go for the eli-looking one."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Eli Grey says, "The mark of a true explorer. You see a hole and you just think
"i just gotta see what's in there""
Eli Grey grins at Evenia Callseah.
Evenia Callseah snickers.
Damien Alexander asks, "Who would what?"
Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.
Evenia Callseah says, "Ather wants to feed a pet felo to his lizard to see if it
reacts differently or something. I said to eli don't let Ather choose which pet.
Because to be a butt, he'd choose the Eli-looking one."
Ather Jammoa says, "Na, I'd let him choose."
Damien says to Evenia, "Fancy a game of Trade Cycles?"
Damien Alexander says, "It's been ages since I've gotten ta play that game."
Evenia says to Damien, "When I'm a bit more awake and have had at least one more
coffee, sure."
Damien Alexander smiles at Evenia Callseah.
Evenia says to Eli, "Don't forget to tell metal face down there to feed that
aquarium."
Eli Grey asks, "Yes, but what should he feed it to?"
Evenia says to Eli, "Gadget. That's it. I always forget his name."
Evenia Callseah gasps at Eli Grey.
Eli Grey snickers at Evenia Callseah.
Evenia says to Eli, "That aquarium was custom built by the torus! Don't even..."
Eli Grey nods. "I've been making sure he does his job, don't worry."
Damien says to Evenia, "Ya brought an aquarium?"
Evenia says to Damien, "Yeah. It always comes with me when I go anywhere. Just
one. The one that has every kind of fish in it."
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Damien says to Evenia, "Did ya get it decorated special, like ya did mine?"
Evenia Callseah nods.
Eli says to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, "Tegan, go tack for us."
Evenia Callseah laughs.
Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Hi tegan!"
Tegan the small circular sanitation bot greets Evenia with a barrage of cheerful
dinging!
Evenia Callseah beams.
Damien Alexander chuckles. "Tegan is funny."
Evenia Callseah says, "Tegan is awesome. Except for when she ate Eli's rift cup
because he stupidly gave it to her."
Eli Grey sighs. "Poor rift cup."
"Rift cup?" Damien Alexander arches an eyebrow.
Evenia says to Eli, "I don't remember the full story of the rift cup."
"Another me from someplace where I don't have my blue skin, came in and dropped
it on an expidition." Eli Grey nods. "He saw me and looked super freaked out and
when he vanished, his coffee cup remained."
Eli Grey says, "Just strolled into observation, like everything was normal."
Damien Alexander stares at Eli Grey. "Wild."
Eli Grey sighs. "Then I was using it for a while and gave it to Tegan out of
habit when I was finished with my coffee."
Damien Alexander asks, "I thought Tegan had a compartment, though. You couldn't
get it back?"
Eli Grey shakes his head. "No, I tried."
Eli Grey shrugs. "I guess it was really just a cup in the end, but it was at
least mildly special to me."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
Damien Alexander says, "Asteria feels yer pain."
Damien Alexander chuckles.
Eli Grey grins.
Eli Grey says, "That little thing that it's in is too adorable."
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a soft fuchsia Tardick
lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.
Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.
Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail
curled loosely around her.
Evenia Callseah says, "Where is my jib. I'm good with a jib. Let me at it."
Damien Alexander says, "Jibber jabber."
Eli Grey smirks. "Jib."
Nissi Valdaire stretches.
Evenia Callseah grins at Nissi Valdaire.
Eli Grey pats Nissi Valdaire on the back. "I like the cut of your jib."
Evenia Callseah coughs.
Lily Kaise grins.
Evenia Callseah says, "Um."
Evenia Callseah chortles.
Damien Alexander says, "Don't cut yer jib."
Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Nissi Valdaire.
Nissi Valdaire asks, "Are we all on course and stuff?"
Ather Jammoa points at a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From
the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa".
Evenia Callseah nods.
Lily Kaise points at Ather Jammoa.
Lily Kaise exclaims, "He did it!"
Lily Kaise laughs.
Nissi Valdaire nods.
wave nissi
You wave to Nissi Valdaire.
Damien says to Nissi, "Heya."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Hi."
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Lily Kaise asks, "Wow it only took us... what half a cycle to make it to 1 LTC?"
Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.
Eli Grey says, "The spiders are catching us. Soon the ship will get stuck and
we'll all end up in oval-shaped cocoons. My dad always said this would happen if
I became a pilot."
Lily Kaise says, "Haha."
Damien says to Eli, "Yer dad said you'd become a cocoon?"
Evenia Callseah laughs.
Eli Grey says, ""A pilot?" he said, "do you want to get eaten by interdimensiona
l spiders?""
Evenia Callseah giggles.
Damien Alexander chuckles.
Nicolette Lawrence says, "Well now we know where you get it from anyway."
Nicolette Lawrence mutters.
Damien Alexander glances at Nicolette Lawrence and glances at Eli Grey.
Damien Alexander shrugs.
Evenia Callseah chuckles. "Here she goes."
Eli Grey grins at Nicolette Lawrence.
Eli Grey says, "Nicolette said I'm the martest pilot in the AEU, she told me
so."
Eli Grey says, "Er.. smartest."
Eli Grey snickers.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Damien Alexander laughs.
Lily Kaise says, "No Vernos is."
Lily Kaise laughs.
laugh lily
You laugh at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise squints.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Eli Grey sighs.
Eli Grey says, "They've almost got us."
Eli Grey says, "This is still blazing fast compared to the other day."
Eli Grey shudders.
Evenia Callseah says, "It's okay. They'll eat the weird-looking ones first. So
eli. You're screwed."
Evenia says to Eli, "I couldn't convert the speed you told me the other day into
LTC's. But it would have sucked. Either way."
Eli Grey says, "Would have been um..."
Eli Grey asks, "12.5 mincycles per seccycle I think?"
Evenia Callseah winces.
Damien Alexander says, "Sanity on a stick, that's slow."
Evenia Callseah says, "Okay. Fuck that."
Eli Grey asks, "Because it's like lightminutes times 2.5 or something, right?"
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Evenia Callseah asks, "I think so?"
Damien Alexander says, "I use... 7.74 light-years per LTC... or something."
Damien Alexander says, "Man, it's been a while since I really had to worry about
it."
Evenia Callseah says, "And this is what you get, for not spending the 5 hundred
million on that nice little part that would have helped."
Eli Grey sighs. "I know."
Damien Alexander laughs.
Eli Grey says, "If I had known that I couldn't get the turbine and solar panels
at the same time, I would have definitely picked it up."
Damien Alexander says, "I got that on almost all my ships that use the rift."
Lily Kaise nods.
Damien Alexander says, "There's one that don't have it. I forget which one."
Evenia Callseah says, "Ah but you did not do your research, thus you crawled
through the rift."
Evenia Callseah gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
Eli Grey says, "I tacked for a while, but even that was kinda slow going. I
eventually just dropped out and set the ship to vector so I could pass out for
the night."
Evenia says to Damien, "I actually think it's the platform."
Damien says to Evenia, "Nah, the platform's in LTCs."
Nicolette says to Eli, "Did you autovector?"
Eli Grey nods to Nicolette Lawrence.
Nicolette Lawrence says, "Figures."
Nicolette mutters and mutters.
Eli Grey asks, "What's wrong with auto-vector?"
Eli Grey says, "I figured it would be better than sitting in one spot."
Damien says to Evenia, "It's one of the ships I don't use too much."
Evenia says to Damien, "Oh yeah. But I'm talking about that auto tacking upgrade
you can buy. Eli didn't put it on the sightseer. Therefore...completely shit
speed."
Nicolette Lawrence says, "It's just weird."
Damien Alexander exclaims, "Oh!"
Damien Alexander says, "That's not what I thought you were talkin' about."
Eli Grey nods. "The impeller."
Damien Alexander says, "Right, I don't have that."
Evenia Callseah nods. "That thing. Yeah that."
Evenia Callseah says, "It's super handy."
Damien Alexander says, "I thought ya meant the LTC converter thing."
Nissi Valdaire asks, "Auto tacking?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Eli says to Nissi, "Well that's sort of how the tech explains it though I'm not
sure it's the most apt description."
Lily Kaise shrugs.
Evenia Callseah says, "I meant the impeller. I'm still half-asleep, someone
figured it out."
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Damien Alexander chuckles.
Eli Grey says, "I used to always get it, but I never realized how much it was
helping me until I didn't have it the other day."
Evenia Callseah says, "I don't put it on everything, but I do put it on things
that are gonna do extended rift travel."
Eli Grey says, "Pretty sure it can only go on exploration ships."
Evenia Callseah nods.
Damien Alexander says, "I don't think any of my ships have that."
Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.
Eli says to Damien, "Just gives you a more garunteed minimum speed. Instead of
going 5 LmS the other day, I would have probably been going at least 300 LmS
instead."
Eli Grey says, "Which, is still not super fast, but it's way better than 5."
Damien Alexander nods to Eli Grey.
Damien Alexander says, "Could get it on the platform."
Evenia Callseah says, "I think it's worth having. But I guess we're all
different. Like I'm still debating over furnace, or high/low on my carrier, and
I can't get straight advice from anyone. Everyone is glad to tell me what's
better, or what doesn't work, and then drift off into some conversation about
solar panels, but I just want the cold hard facts so I can decide."
Ather Jammoa says, "Furnace on a carrier would be a disaster."
Eli Grey asks, "A disaster?"
Eli Grey asks, "I guess because of the low cargo space?"
Ather Jammoa says, "You can't get enough debris in there for a full charge
without continuously salvaging."
Damien says to Evenia, "I remember how much of a hit Akemi's science ship's
sensors took when she installed the hi-lo on hers."
Evenia Callseah says, "I think what would help. Is seeing a carrier with a
sensor plant. And the high/low before I decide."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I have it on my carrier but it also makes it pretty
wobbly."
Eli Grey asks, "Wobbly?"
Bryan Stout says, "Impeller, I think I put that on my gem."
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Lily Kaise says, "Still if I need to take stuff a good distance, that's the
trade off."
Bryan Stout says, OOCly, "Please tell me I spelled that right, belatedly."
Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Yeah impeller, it was right."
Evenia Callseah says, "Well see I'm happy to lose sensors because...It's a
carrier, I don't need it to see the space hotdog from 5 LTC's away, but it's one
of those decisions you can only make once."
Ather Jammoa says, "You can certianly make it more than once."
Bryan Stout says, OOCly, "No, was talking about gemini."
Lily Kaise says, "Well they're already pretty deaf but yeah."
Bryan Stout asks, "Can't you take an upgrade off at farport and store it?"
Ather Jammoa says, "You can take it off anywhere and store it."
Ather Jammoa says, "Not just farport."
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh I had no idea!"
Nicolette Lawrence scrambles to her feet.
Nicolette Lawrence rolls down.
Evenia Callseah says, "Well holy fuck."
Eli Grey asks, "Wait.. what?"
Bryan Stout says, "Oh."
Eli Grey asks, "You can store upgrades?"
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah no that's nifty."
Eli looks baffled.
Bryan Stout nods.
Ather Jammoa says, "At many upgrade shops."
Damien Alexander says, "Didn't know that."
Ather Jammoa says, "It's been something that has been allowed for a few years
now."
Lily says to Ather, "That needs to be put in your book... ahem!"
Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Well fuck me dead. If I'd known that little piece of
information. I wouldn't be debating. I'd be testing!"
Lily Kaise says, "Me too."
Ather Jammoa says, "Why the fuck would I put it in the book."
Damien Alexander says, "Yeah."
Lily Kaise says, "Because the rest of us had no idea before."
Eli says to Ather, "Because you absolutely love making new editions of your
book, of course."
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
chuckle eli
Lily Kaise says, "Right."
You chuckle at Eli Grey.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I knew! This carrier's high-low upgrade sits at Farport to
this day."
Ather Jammoa grins at Nissi Valdaire.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Ather Jammoa says, "I think I hvae a sola rpanel upgrade sitting somewhere."
Damien Alexander says, "Love ta get solar panels on one of my exploration
ships."
Evenia Callseah says, "Well shit. That makes things much easier."
Eli says to Ather, "What ended up happening with the skim thing? It seemed like
things were all ready to go for a bit there."
Evenia Callseah says, "I don't wanna part with 50 tael."
Ather Jammoa says, "Disagreements."
Eli Grey asks, "Oh, because of the vote?"
Ather Jammoa says, "Na."
Ather Jammoa says, "The vote passed."
Eli Grey says, "Oh ok."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Evenia Callseah opens a small black leather zip pouch.
Evenia Callseah removes a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" from
a small black leather zip pouch.
Evenia Callseah begins reading in a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe
Edition".
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.
Eli Grey says, "Hmm.. where's tobias and Sarah? I haven't seen them since we
left."
'I didn't eat them.
You say, "I didn't eat them."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe we left them behind."
Eli Grey looks at Nissi Valdaire thoughtfully.
Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I guess they're gone forever."
Nissi Valdaire looks at Eli Grey and shrugs.
Eli Grey smirks. "I'm pretty sure I saw the ship down there at least."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Well the ship's the valuable part. What could we get for
those two, some potato wedges? Delicious, but no thanks."
Eli Grey chuckles.
Damien Alexander arches an eyebrow.
Evenia Callseah puts a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" in a
small black leather zip pouch.
Evenia Callseah closes a small black leather zip pouch.
Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.
Nissi Valdaire walks down.
Nissi Valdaire walks in from below.
Nissi Valdaire sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple
throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.
Evenia Callseah sighs. "Keegan needs to fix that book."
Nissi Valdaire says, "They're aboard, somewhere."
Eli Grey sighs. "Now I want potato wedges."
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Eli Grey says, "And I don't even have any chips left, it's tragic."
Evenia Callseah says, "An Eli without chippy's is just strange."
Damien says to Evenia, "So how about that game of Trade Cycles? I'll fetch ya
some coffee if ya want."
Damien Alexander smiles at Evenia Callseah.
The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

cooker with a golden dragon on top. The device grinds and gurgles for a moment,
simultaneously emitting a burst of aromatic steam, and a serving of hot
pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl drops into the dispensing area, which he
promptly retrieves.
Evenia Callseah says to Eli, Fomoir of legend, "Did you have him feed them for
me today? I hope so. Coz I don't wanna be you if you kill those fish."

Eli, Fomoir of legend quickly drains a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream
and sugar.
Eli, Fomoir of legend gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot,
which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

fact."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "I could have sworn I saw him do it at least once
after that, but it must have been my imagination."
Eli, Fomoir of legend retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot
pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into his mouth.

I felt bad for him for a moment."
Ather hmms.
Eli says to Ather, "Yeah, the robot will apparently not caretake to feed fish,
if there's no felo food on board."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "I guess it messes up it's routine."
Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, no, who cares about that? I'm trying to think what to
feed skipper."
Eli, Fomoir of legend laughs.
Ather Jammoa examines a robotic chef named Nellie for a moment.
Ather Jammoa says, "Ok, that thing's choices suck."
Evenia Callseah says, "He did have felo food aboard till he kicked it out of the
hold. After that. Gadget told him to shove it."
Lily Kaise says, "'you can feed him rations."
Eli says to Evenia, "Did you already get rid of that dead aquapede?"
Evenia Callseah nods to Eli, Fomoir of legend.
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Maybe Skipper can eat that."

terrible for them."
Evenia Callseah says, "He goes nuts for fish though."
Eli, Fomoir of legend wrinkles his nose.
Evenia says to Lily, "Nah, I open the can and take out the ham first."
Eli says to Johann, "I guess that's the circle of life."
Lily Kaise says, "I had pizza for her initially but after a few days I simply
won't feed that to her."

longer."

is removed."

ago?"

sugar.
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "There was an asteroid field a little earlier too
that looked new."
Ted Warburton says, "Oh cool."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Mostly just because it didn't pop up at the edge of
the sensors."
Johann Schraft asks, "OH man, I hate it when that happens. It's like, where did
that come from?"
Ted Warburton says, "I don't suppose we could survey it on here though."
Eli, Fomoir of legend nods. "I have the stuff o my sightseer, and it would go to
everyone who was on board the ship it launched from."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "But I don't think folks want to do that."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "And also, no X-ray on the sightseer, and only the
second impact probe."
Ted Warburton nods.
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
Ted Warburton takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and

Ted Warburton says, "Oh, thought it was more, I might have enough."
Lily Kaise says, "6 lenses."
Lily Kaise says, "'but I seill have to buy the spectrscopes but I do have most
of the other stuff installed and I wouldn't have but I forgot about the imager."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Eli, Fomoir of legend grins.
Ted Warburton says, "I just know I'm going to bankrupt myself within a few weeks
of getting home."
Lily Kaise says, "It will hold 20 probes though which isn't bad for a tiny ship
like that."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Gotta have the imager before you can get the
spectroscope stuff."
Ted Warburton says, "Makes sense."
Eli, Fomoir of legend exclaims, "Science missiles!"
"I jsut said!" Lily Kaise grins at Eli, Fomoir of legend.
Lily Kaise laughs.
Eli says to Lily, "Oh I just didn't know if you realized that they were together
is all."
Ted Warburton says, "Even so, setting up a platform will cost me a hell of a
lot."
Lily Kaise says, "I have 7 lenses but i'm saving up to build something so."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "It's fun to probe and scan stuff in the sightseer."
Eli, Fomoir of legend chuckles.
Lily Kaise says, "Or help Shule get his Arachnoid built."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Just short little trips."
Lily Kaise nods.
Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, now if I want to run around in one of those, do I
then need an extra, or can it drop in and out of the platform, I never know
where upgrades live."
Lily Kaise says, "My platform holds 90 I think."

Evenia blinks, eyeing the rift status displays for a moment.
Lily says to Eli, "Well it said you and Evenia discovered the other field and I
didn't see any other credits in the library."
Evenia Callseah asks, "Hmm?"
Damien fidgets.
Lily Kaise says, "For the probes."
Eli, Fomoir of legend sighs. "Yeah I know."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "For some reason it didn't have anyone listed, and
then she wanted to go up and get an image of it. For some reason that put us on
there."
Evenia Callseah asks, "I think that was probably because we didn't launch
directly from the ship?"
Eli, Fomoir of legend nods.
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah because we weren't there I guess."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Yeah you have to launch directly from the ship."

take an image. Even if it's already been imaged. Just like an I was here image.
Kinda thing."
Lily Kaise says, "Well uh."
Aisling the Fox stretches.
Lily Kaise says, "Ok."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "If you do it directly from a ship, everyone on the
ship that it launched from gets credit."
Evenia Callseah shrugs.
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah nice to wait a tad so others can get credit as well. Just
saying but what is done is done."
Evenia Callseah says, "I figured Mel and all them would be still on record for
it, so I didn't even think about that."
Evenia Callseah says, "I don't do it for credit. That's the thing. Normally when
I do that. It's been imaged. As I new that place had."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Yeah the image isn't worht anything heh."
Evenia Callseah coughs. "I knew, also. I can't talk today."
Lily Kaise says, "Well the image, when it is turned in does pay out to the
others."
Evenia Callseah says, "Well sure. But I don't turn them in."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but on an expedition like this, would be nice for others,
that's all. Anyway tht's all I'll say."
Evenia Callseah says, "And as I said. Mel and all those guys imaged and probed
it when they were there last time, so I didn't think that image would end up
doing what it did."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Heh no one is getting credit for it. Melinda and
them got all the credit and stuff when they first discovred it."
Evenia Callseah nods.
Evenia Callseah says, "That's what I mean. And normally on a trip like this, I
would always wait till the main image was taken."
It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.
A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the
Fox's shoulder.
Ted Warburton says, "Hang on, what happened here? I'm confused."
Evenia says to Ted, "So I had eli take me up in soul to grab my usual image. But
only he and I show in the library for finding that field. But we Know that Mel's
trip found, imaged, and probed it."
Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Yeah, it's just hte library part of it."
Evenia Callseah nods.
Ted Warburton says, "Yeah. We found a few odd things with who's listed,
sometimes people don't show for ages and weird things like that, like a couple
of us would show when we started, but more of us by the end."
Evenia Callseah says, "That's why I just went and got it, because I knew all
that had been done."
Eli, Fomoir of legend nods.
Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, the libary is a mysterious thing."
Ted Warburton says, "Library even."
Evenia Callseah nods.
Ted Warburton says, "I'm sure I remember us finding that one though, as well as
Wheel of Tears."
Lily Kaise says, "When I ren the library, it said Discoverers Evenia and e/li so
just saying what I saw as well as a close probe was run."
Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, that is weird, but by no means the first weirdness
I've seen with it."
Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. Mel has the image back home."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah guess there's some issues with how they are tracking
things."
Evenia Callseah says, "And if it showed a probe. That definitely wasn't us. So
that's stuff from Mel's trip. I just got my image and landed."
Ted says to Lily, "Were you there for any of the weirdness? I can't remember."
Eli, Fomoir of legend nods. "Yeah before it showed it had been probed and imaged
and stuff, but said discoverers as none."
Eli, Fomoir of legend examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.
Ted Warburton says, "Doesn't surprise me, we saw stuff like that happen too."
Eli, Fomoir of legend tips the bowl into his mouth and drinks the richly
flavored broth, finishing it off.
Ted Warburton finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.
Ted Warburton gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which
accepts it and stores it in a compartment.
Do you know what they want?
Evenia Callseah says, "Yes. All the tael."
Nicolette Lawrence rolls in from below.

l nicolette
Nicolette Lawrence
She appears to be 23 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is of average build with attractively curved hips and
attractive calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average
breasts. Her face is heart-shaped and pretty, with a button nose and dimpled
chin. Her lips are satiny soft and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of
glistening white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are
sparkling turquoise and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is
silvery blonde and loosely styled and left to fall freely down her back. She has
neatly trimmed clear fingernails. She has a shimmering gold barrette inset with
small sapphires, a beautiful red crystal rose hairpin, and a shimmering gold
barrette inset with small sapphires in her hair. She has a small interestingly-s
haped birthmark on her right cheek.
A small enameled sapphire butterfly pierces her left cheek.
 She is wearing a silver flightsuit, a beautiful diamond wrist cuff, and a pair
of light-weight black ship shoes. She is also wearing a pair of stunning
diamond-nested tanzanite teardrop chandelier earrings, a delicate gold chain
necklace, a finely crafted skull pendant of red and silver dichroic glass on a
slender gold chain, a gold link bracelet with numerous small skull charms of red
and silver dichroic glass, a delicate white gold link bracelet with a single red
crystal spider suspended from it, a white stone ring with a silver band, a
roaring metallic gold tigress stamp, a silver touch einrophone in a black
leather phone holster, a neon purple vibro-baton, a bulky asteroid supply
cannon, and a golden Feng Wo coin purse. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, right
wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual

A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every

was going through a rough time recently, and randomly I get a package with these
cute tiger-striped pillows from her with a note, telling me she hoped they made

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy
printed on the chest and a pair of soft electric blue boots. She is also wearing
a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with
a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing
a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both
hands are left uncovered.

and down its center. Vendors call out to the many passersby, gesturing and
holding up their merchandise for inspection. At the west end of the corridor,
several elderly people drink tea and play an odd game of tiles set up on low
black tables. They seem completely oblivious to the near chaos around them. The
wide corridor continues to the north and west, and, nearly hidden by the
numerous advertisements plastered to the metal walls, smaller corridors lead
somewhere east and south.

friendly smiles at customers, especially if they seem to be tourists. Several

A great deal of banging and clanging goes on behind the closed doors along this
narrow alley. The only clue as to what causes the noise is a sign on one door
that reads: 'Shen Long Foodage Devices and Accoutrements. Workers Only!' The
door appears to be locked securely, but along the opposite wall is a display of
appliances that glimmer in the low lighting, closely watched over by an elderly
woman seated in a tall chair in the middle of them. A narrow stairway leads at
the end of this alley leads back down to the main level of the station.

Lily Kaise says, "I love this shop obviously."
[Feng Wo Station; Blending Looms Alley]
Visible behind the gated doorways on one side of this alley is a cramped factory
where large looms work ceaselessy to create rolled bolts of colored and printed
fabrics, and on the other side is a workshop where tailors, male and female,
labor to create clothing sewn of those fabrics. The air is filled with a
combination of sounds: the rumble of the heavy machinery, the incessant chatter
of the workers, and the exclamations of shoppers coming to examine the brightly
hued garments displayed on racks beneath the lanterns strung from the ceiling
along the corridor. A twisting stairway leads down from here to the main level
of the station.

a miniature red and gold pagoda
This red pagoda measures twenty centimeters on each side. It has a traditional
sloping roof with a small golden-eyed red dragon at each corner, and the sides
are comprised of clear plastic panels perforated with tiny regularly spaced air
holes. Inside the pagoda is a carefully arranged landscape. Decaying plant
matter and clumps of moss-covered pebbles cover the floor, half hiding the roots
of a penjing ginkgo tree growing up from the center of the pagoda, its delicate
branches laden with small scalloped leaves. Beneath the tree, a shallow golden
cup filled with slow-growing lacy blue fungus sits near a clump of tiny pink
flowers irrigated by a slender funnel of hydrophilic netting. Occasionally, a
small red cricket with large, delicately veined wings can be seen moving around
among the pebbles and flowers. On the square red lacquered base of the pagoda is
a gold plaque reading: 'Cricket of Singing and Good Luck Bringing.'
Lily Kaise says, "And more plants here."

Beneath the glow of a string of numerous small white lanterns hanging from the
ceiling of this narrow alley, clothing racks are set up inviting the inspection
and purchase of several varieties of richly colored coats and pants. The
exquisite embroidery on the clothing seems to shimmer in the soft light. Several
similar narrow alleys lead away into the depths of the station, but each one is
secured by a locked barred door, and all you can see from here are that they are
lined by closely spaced doorways. A narrow stairway leads up to a higher level
of the station.

[Feng Wo Station; Market]
An old-style market place thrives in this wide L-shaped corridor. Red and orange
lanterns hang from the ceiling, casting a warm glow over throngs of colorfully
dressed people shopping at small booths set up along the walls of the corridor
and down its center. Vendors call out to the many passersby, gesturing and
holding up their merchandise for inspection. At the west end of the corridor,
several elderly people drink tea and play an odd game of tiles set up on low
black tables. They seem completely oblivious to the near chaos around them. The
wide corridor continues to the north and west, and, nearly hidden by the
numerous advertisements plastered to the metal walls, smaller corridors lead
somewhere east and south.

by a locked gate, leaving the way open only down an narrow staircase to a lower
level of the station. A small table where posters are sold has been set up near

Lily Kaise says, "I also thought I had given Nissi a key to this ship awhile
back. Maybe it was Melinda so there was nothing underhanded. It's just amazing
how they love to take their assumptions and turn into their own reality. That is
what Melinda did and others and they get away with this stuff."

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Future Crimes"; Docking Bay.

CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold

Lily Kaise says, "After what happened to Constantine and nissi, I'd grab up
asteria and pile everything on there especially the fish and go for it."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Evenia looks at Johann, her face resolving into a hardened mask, her eyes almost
piercing.
Johann says to Evenia, "Very good number one."
Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers
Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.
Evenia Callseah chuckles.

Lily Kaise says, "There in case you want to confirm if we're in some sleezy
hotel..."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Evenia Callseah points at Eli Grey. "Thing."
chuckle lily
You chuckle at Lily Kaise.
Eli Grey grins.
Eli Grey gives an empty can to Evenia Callseah.
Johann says to Lily, "Does Evenia have one? I don't know how up to everything I
will be."
Eli Grey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.
Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Those dudes wouldn't even take my tael!"
Eli Grey sits down on a traditional round gray zafu.
Eli Grey grins at Evenia Callseah.
Evenia Callseah forcefully hurls an empty can at Eli Grey.
Eli Grey deftly catches it.
Eli Grey asks, "Do what?"
Eli Grey asks, "There were people who refused your business?"
Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.
Lily says to Eli, "Those dudes at the desk of the Inn on Feng Wo wouldn't take
my tael!"
Eli Grey blinks.
Eli Grey says, "So weird."
Lily Kaise says, "We were just going to get a good shower, hangout and rest a
little but we weren't staying over. I also jsut wanted to show Shule tht it is
actually a pretty nice place."
Evenia says to Johann, "Most of the crew probably don't even know that you're
gonna be laying pretty low. So they don't know what you arranged. Silly thing."
Eli Grey says, "It looked pretty nice."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I have stayed there a couple of times."
Johann says to Evenia, "Oh. You mean gossip hasn't made the rounds? What kind of
ship is this?"
Evenia Callseah chortles.
Eli Grey glances at Johann Schraft. "Laying low? What did you do now, Johann."
A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous
blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as
a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.
Lily says to Eli, "I know that was odd. I hope it's not something with our
issues tith mutuality."
Lily Kaise says, "With that is."
Lily Kaise says, "I'd doubt it though."
Johann says to Eli, "I am not feeling great, so unless it relates to the ship,
Evenia is in charge."
Lily Kaise says, "Since you pay in Feng Wo currency."
Evenia says to Johann, "It's up to you to let people know. I wasn't gonna open
my mouth."
Johann says to Evenia, "Well, now they know. Feel free to spread the gossip."
Johann Schraft grins.
Eli Grey says, "Evenia is in charge? Oh great, now she's goign to be
unbearable."
Evenia Callseah laughs.
Eli Grey snickers.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Johann says to Eli, "Well, the problem with doing things well is people give yo
more things to do."
Eli Grey says, "Probably have us all shoveling debris, even when we don't need
to."
Eli Grey grins at Johann Schraft.
Johann says to Eli, "The furnace will break eventually."
Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "As Johann instructed, I am now
spreading the gossip. He's not feeling well, so unless it directly relates to
Nissi's ship, I'm in charge of the trip. I have now done as Johann asked, and
spread it around."
Lily Kaise says, "Good shule we can hide for the rest of this."
Eli Grey says, "Yeah,  then she'll be like, "I don't care that it's broken, just
shovel it into a corneR!""
Evenia Callseah shakes her head.
Evenia Callseah says, "We'll use your blue glow to power the ship. It means
we'll have to kill you, but..."
Evenia Callseah shrugs.
Eli Grey smirks.
Evenia Callseah says, "Hey. I totally know how to be in command. Set the trim to
20. Toss out a random heading. And we'll get home eventually. Oh and fuck
charge. Who needs that."

Lily Kaise says, "Lizzies."

Eli Grey says, "I just remember waking up with a spider on my face."

minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.
'That would not be my favorite way to wake up.
You say, "That would not be my favorite way to wake up."
Lily says to you, "Well when I traded the compressor yesterday I sure was hoping
somebody would offer a lizard."
Evenia Callseah says, "Who was it...The other gray. AEU gray. had an epic flip

Evenia Callseah says, "It was great though. He was all screaming over the pa.
And I was almost on the deck. Laughing."
Eli Grey says, "And that other Eve, the Fringe one."
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Our blue/gray guy is more easy-going!"
Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.
'And the other one is what... Flipping Gray?
You ask, "And the other one is what... Flipping Gray?"
Eli Grey grins. "I try to be."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

Evenia Callseah pokes Eli Grey in the ribs!
Lily Kaise chuckles.

You laugh.
Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers
Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.
Eli Grey asks, "So Gray's not a big fan of the lizards, huh?"
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Come on! Don't be shy! There's plenty
in this decanter up here."
'apparently not
You say, "Apparently not."
Johann Schraft says, "ONly his own."
Evenia Callseah says, "Well not in his bed, apparently. And of course I made my
comments about that too."

You chuckle.
Lily Kaise says, "Heh tht does suprise me a little."
Evenia Callseah says, "All in fun, of course. He's cool."
Lily Kaise says, "I thought he might find them kind of cool."

'wander and scare people
You say, "Wander and scare people."
Lily Kaise says, "You know when I first saw them, I was a little taken aback but
I dunno. They grow on you. I wouldn't give up Asteria for anything. I feel proud
that I was able to trade for her and I also feel I rescued her as her little
ribs were literally showing when I got her."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
'And she needs a sibling.
You say, "And she needs a sibling."
Lily says to you, "I know!"
Lily says to you, "I tried earlier! I thought my compressor would win!"
Evenia Callseah says, "I do love how Mel shares Zeus with me. That means the
universe to me. We call it the joint lizard custody arrangement."
Lily Kaise says, "But yeah I did get Asteria with an artifact detector and I
think that is how Melinda got Zeus so I dunno... maybe that along with certain
trade goods is the thing."
Eli Grey says, "Does anyone even know how much tael you would get for a lizard?
I can only assume that no one has ever actually taken that step."
Lily Kaise says, "No idea I sotped the trade and didn't go farther."
Evenia Callseah says, "Fuck that! If I got a lizard in my hands, you bet your
ass I wouldn't continue trading."
Lily Kaise says, "Stopped."
Lily Kaise says, "When they put down the cage, it was all over for me."
Johann Schraft asks, "The other question is has anybody ever hatched their space
dragon egg?"
You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.
Evenia Callseah says, "I don't think so. Fling some plasma at one and..."
Eli Grey says, "Maybe that's where that big space dragon came from in A14."
Lily Kaise says, "No idea as I didn't get any and I gave Nicolette shit for
taking hers as I was terrified of them."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Evenia Callseah says, "I would love one though."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Eli Grey asks, "Would you ride around on it, wearing a spacesuit?"
Lily Kaise asks, "But I know hmm I think Keegan had one and Caesar had one and
whom else?"
Evenia Callseah says, "Sure. With huge fuckoff wings on my back."
Johann Schraft says, "Yes."
Evenia Callseah says, "Um. I think Nicolette gave hers to...I can't think of her
name. either way that couple has 2 now."
Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers
Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.
Johann Schraft asks, "Has anybody ever tried trading tael for a lizard?"
Eli Grey nods to Johann Schraft. "Yeah, I was just wondering htat."
Evenia Callseah says, "No, but fuck I would if it would work."
Eli Grey says, "Like, I'm sure you could just be like I've got good tael for a
tardic lizard!""
Johann Schraft says, "I am sad, I only got four tael for an artifact detector
though."
Sean Sloan walks in from below.
Sean Sloan sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw
pillow with thick silver fringe on it.
Evenia Callseah pokes Sean Sloan in the ribs!
Johann Schraft nods to Sean Sloan.
Sean Sloan wriggles his fingers.
Eli Grey points at Sean Sloan. "It's a Sean thing."
Evenia Callseah says, "I managed 8 for that compressor, but that trade took a
while."
Sean Sloan glances at Evenia Callseah.
Evenia Callseah glares at Sean Sloan.
Sean Sloan tickles Evenia Callseah!
Sean Sloan snickers.
Eli Grey asks, "Is that more than what you would have gotten at say, Andy's?"
Evenia Callseah nods.
Evenia Callseah says, "For sure."
Johann Schraft says, "No."
Lily Kaise says, "Yep I got I think 8 and a silver tael and some additional it
was a pretty long trade."
Johann Schraft says, "Not for me."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.
Johann Schraft says, "Or last time I traded at Tom Town I think the detector
went for six tael."
Evenia Callseah says, "It was interesting though, my onboard beacon went for
less than 3."
Johann Schraft says, "Then three went to Nathaniel's fine."
Lily Kaise says, "I've only gotten about 4 max for a detector except for Asteria
so who knows what the final outcome would have been."
Evenia Callseah says, "But at tom town. It was an onboard beacon that went for
like 7 tael. And detector for 4."
Johann Schraft says, "I would trade a lizard though for that bumpercar."
Lily Kaise laughs.
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah that bumper car looks cool!"
Eli Grey asks, "I know right?"
Lily Kaise grins.

Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers

in a long long time so it was fine!"
smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise smiles at you.
Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. I enjoy long trades."
The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and
purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.
Lily Kaise says, "Oo love that."
Sean Sloan asks, "So we heading home or stopping at Andy's?"
Evenia Callseah says, "I hadn't got that far yet. We only launched like 6 hours
ago."
Eli Grey pats Evenia Callseah on the back. "We need a decision."
Evenia Callseah chuckles.
Evenia Callseah says, "I think it depends on nissi. If Nissi wants to charge up
we will, if not..."
Evenia Callseah says, "I'm okay either way."
Eli Grey sighs at Evenia Callseah. "That's just Nissi being in charge."
Eli Grey snickers.
Evenia Callseah sighs at Eli Grey.
Evenia Callseah says, "Well it's her ship, nutball."
The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship
is back in the riftflow.
The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship
is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.
Evenia Callseah says, "I mean. If Nissi wants to fly us right into the middle of
a black hole. I would politely say fuck that and abandon ship. But I'd not stop
her."
Eli Grey says, "If you abandon ship, you'll never meet the lovely black hole
people."
Eli Grey says, "They just sorta look like squish. Everything looks like squish
in the black hole."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.

Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker: Sleepily says, "Thanks."
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Nite."
"Now it's harder to pick on someone." Evenia Callseah sighs. "He's an easy
target."
Evenia Callseah glances at Sean Sloan.
Evenia says to Sean, "I take that back, you're still awake."
Evenia Callseah slides a large chunk from some snake meat on a stick, pops it
into her mouth, and slowly chews it.
Evenia Callseah sets her teeth into a chunk of meat on some snake meat on a

Eli Grey chuckles.
Eli Grey says, "But yeah, you are right."
Evenia Callseah pokes Eli Grey in the ribs!
Evenia says to Eli, "I can't help it that you like shooting huge science
missiles into un-knowing areas of interest."
Eli Grey says, "We must destroy the Unknowledge."
Evenia Callseah giggles.
Evenia Callseah carefully puts some snake meat on a stick lengthwise into her

Evenia says to Eli, "You just looked like some weird electronic broken bird."
A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other,
then places it back on the conveyor belt.
Eli Grey gasps. "Oh no, my secret."
Eli Grey says, "I'm really several rautines in a suit."
Evenia Callseah giggles.

Hey guys feels good to return after leaving during the middle of the AEU
plotline due to the stress it was causing. I needed to step away because I was
allowing in game stress to affect my health out of character and was having
chest and arm pains. The doctors did discover a abnormal heart beat but it feels
good to return.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily

Eli Grey asks, "Maybe Lilian took the lizard wherever it was that she went?"
Eli Grey flaps his arms at Evenia Callseah.
Evenia Callseah says, "Maybe. But we don't know either way. We know she hasn't
retired, so..."
Evenia Callseah shrugs.
Lily Kaise says, "I'm sorry I took that out. It just occurred to me that I
hadn't seen Isis in a long long time."
Evenia Callseah smiles at Lily Kaise.
Evenia says to Lily, "Don't be sorry, it's a cool poster. It just made me think
is all."
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but makes me a bit sad as I counted about 8 Lizards
amongst pilots and now we may be down to half a dozen."
Evenia Callseah asks, "Thor. Yours. Nissi's. Anfisa's. Zeus...who am I missing?"
Lily Kaise says, "It's just unfortunate that they're not as well cared for as

An arc of light much like a meteor draws itself in the sky overhead.
Evenia Callseah says, "It makes me furious. So many people treat them like
objects. They seem to forget they're real creatures. They need care. They need
love, and they need to be protected. Sure I don't own a lizard, but I share Zeus
with Mel, and so that's something. But it really fucking pisses me off the way
some have been treated."
Evenia Callseah says, "And I'm gonna shut up now before I start ranting."
Lily Kaise says, "Oh I totally agree! Asteria is my pet and coming from someone
who took in as many stray cats as our barn would accomodate and the nice ones we
brought into our house, I love creatures of all sorts and if I take them in,
it's my obligation to cherish and care for them."

put him down. That way if I wake up late or something, someone can feed him. I
never take that risk."
Lily Kaise nods.
'Yeah, Lily does the same thing.
You say, "Yeah, Lily does the same thing."
Lily Kaise says, "Well I generally do that with Asteria unless I'm traveling. I
trust the ship will land but I want to have her safe with me incase something
unforeseen happens."
Evenia Callseah says, "I mean I know they can go something like a week without
feeding, but you get what I mean. I'm always super careful."

[Famous Andy's Trading Post; Docking Bay]
Though Andy's Trading Post is located in the proverbial middle of nowhere, the
docking bay is large by any standard, accommodating a good number of
rickety-looking carriers and transports surrounded by swarms of workers,
well-armed security guards, and sprawling piles of crated cargo. The bay is
roughly square and is enclosed by walls formed of a patchwork of steel plates
with more laid overhead into a high flat ceiling, each plate held in place by
large bolts and thick, lumpy welds. Metal lattices cover the walls, ceiling, and
deck, keeping tangles of cables and grimy ductwork safely out of the way. A
massive airlock on the south side of the bay allows starship arrivals and
departures, while a ramp leads downward from the north side, where a very large
poster is prominently displayed. Wide hatches lead into corridors extending east
and west. The oil-scented air here is a bit smoky, and the gravity is
approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.
