02:03:32 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go west.

02:03:34 You turn general communication off.

02:03:35 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:03:35 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:03:36 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

02:12:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:12:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

02:13:18 [MTTS] atherj: I am actually kind of disappointed that no one got the perfectly plausable babylon 5 reference that I was using in my character's little joke.

02:13:37 [MTTS] usfolks: Just because our chars don't doesn't mean we don't!

02:13:42 [MTTS] Butchulla: I did, but I didn't mention it. It was glorious though.

02:13:50 [MTTS] atherj: Woo Sci-fi fans.

02:14:08 [MTTS] atherj: Anyone who watched B5 is totally OK in my book.

02:14:23 [MTTS] davetaylor: I'm sure most of us are, that's one series I've not seen though.

02:14:31 [MTTS] usfolks: It's been a long time.

02:14:47 [MTTS] Ulias: I've actually been trying to find a descriptive version for a while.

02:14:49 [MTTS] atherj: To be perfectly honest it's probably my favorite Sci-fi series ever. Just because of the way it was so brilliantly done.

02:15:06 [MTTS] davetaylor: Apparently I must look it up.

02:15:09 [MTTS] usfolks: It was a very good series. I should go back and watch it all over.

02:15:11 [MTTS] alc_71: It's a great series.

02:15:17 [MTTS] atherj: I was told that the ending was pretty much decided on right at the very beginning of the series, and they tied everything together so effortlessly and perfectly.

02:15:20 [MTTS] Butchulla: It's amazing.

02:15:30 [MTTS] something: How old we talking?

02:15:41 [MTTS] atherj: Nineties.

02:16:52 [MTTS] atherj: Well actually I think that the last episode of the series aired in like 2000 or 2001.

02:17:24 [MTTS] usfolks: Part of why I need to re-watch it. I think I missed the last season, maybe 2.

02:17:26 [MTTS] davetaylor: Yes, I think you're right, because I think it aired just after I got Sky, in the UK at least.

02:17:33 [MTTS] alc_71: If memory serves, it was 2000.

02:18:06 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Clearing dictors in the tesla pipe, no ships here though."

02:18:19 [MTTS] atherj: And while many of you might disagree with me, Commander Sinclair was my favorite character in the entire series.

02:18:31 You scramble to your feet.

02:18:32 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:18:47 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:18:48 [MTTS] something: I'm feeling very young right now.

02:18:49 Aborted.

02:18:49 [MTTS] muhala: It's been too long. I barely remember who was who.

02:18:56 [MTTS] Butchulla: Actually agreed, Atherj.

02:18:58 [MTTS] usfolks: Same Muhala.

02:19:02 You grab the door handle as you leave.

02:19:07 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

02:19:07 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:19:16 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

02:20:01 [MTTS] muhala: Yeah, my roomate has the whole thing on DVD but I just haven't gotten around to it. Also unless they've made new copies of it it was never described.

02:20:12 [MTTS] atherj: Na, it wasn't.

02:20:25 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Arch site?"

02:20:39 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I keep saying yes."

02:20:41 [MTTS] muhala: Which kind of makes me sad since it did have some good visuals.

02:20:45 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I keep counting you."

02:20:54 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That keeps being cool."

02:20:55 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Beacons?"

02:21:37 [MTTS] something: I'm guessing that Babylon is not the same as Babylon 5.

02:21:42 [MTTS] usfolks: No.

02:21:46 [MTTS] atherj: Na.

02:22:30 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "A-61 clear."

02:22:50 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What happened in a-61?"

02:23:03 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Don't know, just lots of inderdictors."

02:23:19 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. You said clear, I thought you'd fought ships. My bad."

02:23:35 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'd just said what I was doing."

02:26:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, I missed the guy calling out the results."

02:26:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What did we get?"

02:26:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We were down 102%."

02:26:47 The AEU did not reach any of its performance goals.

02:26:47 Top Performers: Dakhal Araegin, Eli Grey, and Constantine Stone.
The current Conquest period began 25 minutes and 56 seconds ago. The period will end in 3 days, 23 hours, 33 minutes, and 14 seconds.

02:26:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

02:26:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn, a guy died."

02:27:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Who died?"

02:27:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Some Best supporter."

02:27:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pro-government supporter got stabbed on Hyperion."

02:27:56 [MTTS] something: I may have found an AD version.

02:28:00 [MTTS] something: I could be wrong, though.

02:28:25 [MTTS] atherj: I was always told that there was only like a couple episodes of the first season described or something.

02:28:43 [MTTS] something: I found the entire first season in a single file folder so unless it just stops half way through.

02:28:56 [MTTS] usfolks: That's quite possible, actually.

02:29:01 [MTTS] something: Which yeah.

02:29:12 [MTTS] something: It was clearly marked as AD though, so shrug.

02:29:29 [MTTS] atherj: Could have been the entire first season, who can know?

02:29:46 [MTTS] usfolks: Even if it wasn't, I'd mark mine like that. So would make sense.

02:31:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Wasn't there a headline recently saying Best had 73% approval?"

02:31:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do you relaly believe those?"

02:31:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And yet this happens on our second most populous planet."

02:31:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, don't forget though that's the same way the attack on Aislign was reproted on at first too."

02:31:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if we should be trying to give a voice to the dissidents on Hyperion."

02:31:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. Aisling."

02:31:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You can't rely on those surveys to give you accurate results. Even if the participants were chosen at random, you don't know what the fuck the randomizer could've chosen for you."

02:32:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And if memory serves, they tried to make it look like it was Aisling's fault at first, no?"

02:32:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I agree. Clearly there are people who aren't being heard."

02:32:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, all they reproted on was tha ta foreigner shot somebody."

02:33:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. yeah."

02:33:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So it's possible the Best supproter was being violent and the others acted in self defense, but there's no way to really know."

02:35:54 [MTTS] something: So yeah, it was only the first few episodes of the first season.

02:39:06 There appear to be about 21 pilots recently active.

02:43:12 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:43:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

02:43:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:44:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:44:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't think pro-government supporters deserve any kindness but violence is not the way nor murder."

02:44:24 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:44:26 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:44:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:45:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."

02:46:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though it is interesting to know that Hyperion is apparently a hotbed of anti-Best sentiment."

02:46:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Considering this and the bombing."

02:46:44 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:46:48 You say to Lily, "Hi my love."

02:47:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:52:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

02:53:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm nto so sure it was murder personally, but it couldn't have been."

02:53:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. it could have been, I mean."

02:54:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:54:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well it's something we certainly shouldn't be in denial over. If we truly believe in human rights and treating humanity without harming them, then this is unacceptable and well unacceptable isn't a strong enough word."

02:56:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "All I know is, that at the protest it was the Best supporters who wre being violent, and that didn't stop the Union press from making it sound like Nissi just shot some guy randomly."

02:56:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:56:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh so they are referring to Nissi? This is way after the fact or was there another rally?"

02:57:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No they're not, but is reminiscent of that."

02:57:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The rally spanned several days. If you had listened to comms on the -days, not -day- that you didn't show up you would've known this."

02:57:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nissi wouldn't kill anybody! She might smack 'em around a bit and strand there asses but she sure wouldn't kill anybody."

02:58:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the stabbign was not Nissi."

02:58:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The one about a foreigner shooting a pro-government supporter was about her though."

02:58:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:58:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes that is what I am referring to so I was confused a bit there."

02:59:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sorry yeah, I'm just saying that there are parallels between the two stories."

02:59:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:59:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok."

03:01:44 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Entertainment."

03:05:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

03:05:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:10:55 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:03:59 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:04:02 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:04:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So did you chase off any merchants yesterday?"

04:04:33 You say, "Nope, I didn't get a chance."

04:04:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Aww I sure know how that is. I just can't be here at work as i'd prefer."

04:05:11 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:05:53 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

04:06:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:06:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh by the way Constantine, the last Scoop I deployed doesn't have the daily pickup module so we'll just get a big payload when this one goes offline. Also, if the strike stops and those others jerks won't deal, we'll put up our own Battle Scanner and otherwise."

04:08:18 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:08:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I started working on a post to the organization but I just ran out of time. No rush onit currently though. I will give them a chance but they are so quick to assume what they haven't any clue about."

04:08:29 You say to Lily, "Ready to go lie down?"

04:08:31 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:08:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure Love."

04:09:16 Not much to see out there.

04:09:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:09:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:09:20 You peer out...

04:09:20 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

04:09:28 You say, "Well, let's head back to the torus."

04:09:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:09:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

04:09:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:09:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:09:36 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:09:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

04:09:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:09:48 Which sector did you mean?

04:09:48

04:09:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:09:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:09:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:09:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:09:57 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:09:57 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:09:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:10:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:10:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:10:01 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:10:04 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:10:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I haven't checked the office but I'll do it perhaps on Saturday."

04:40:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, sounds good."

04:40:46 You laugh.

04:40:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was actually thinking when the strike ends we should do our own xeno station, at least once."

04:40:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've got about 300 artifacts I've been sitting on."

04:41:01 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:41:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "All that money should go to us, not to the orgs who won't include us."

04:41:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:41:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "In case you haven't figured it out Constantine, I'm hard to beat down. I am a survivor and I will always go forward."

04:41:37 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:42:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, we'll figure a way out of this."

04:42:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:42:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And so shall we and yes we will put up a Xeno station. It won't be the highest one but it should pay you reasonably and of course the points would go to a more worthy source than all of those other stingy orgs."

04:42:59 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:43:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is the payout from xeno stations tied to the level of the parts somehow?"

04:43:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:43:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So yeah will put up a Battle Scanner and a xeno station and probably a Salvage Processor."

04:43:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:43:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes quite a bit."

04:45:01 You say to Lily, "I love you."

04:45:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:45:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We can get Rift Accelerators but the Rift Inserter requires 3000 Command and at this rate if we were were still participating with the others, it would probably take at least another year and a half."

04:45:15 You say to Lily, "I love being with you and touching you and being close to you."

04:45:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

04:45:44 Lily says to you, "I love it when you are right here and when you touch me Love."

04:47:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:47:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Trye so we could probably still maintain 777. For the time-being, I have let the transmitter go and the watchtower and the recharging station will go soon too so I jsut plan to sit on it to see if LIBS will get off of their high-horses and deal if not, well guess they will get bored and go home where we'll take over."

04:47:48 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo suddenly jumps onto a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top.

04:47:49 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:48:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:48:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I still don't understand why Accord keeps the Inserters at such a high Command requirement. I have never understood their reasoning behind that as it would seem more beneficial to help less experienced pilots who need the Inserter."

04:49:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

04:49:33 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:49:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is Libs not going to maintain 777 without us?"

04:50:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:50:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Probably not. You know Evenia took their parts out of our Warehouse and then revoked our rights to theirs so how are we going to be able to work together if they are that way?"

04:50:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:50:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Whoops and probably not. You know Evenia took their parts out of our Warehouse and then revoked our rights to theirs so how are we going to be able to work together if they are that way?"

04:50:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:50:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So yeah LIBS can go suck on a black hole."

04:51:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:51:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And I intended to say it righ there."

04:51:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:51:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We shall build our own stations pretty soon."

04:51:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:51:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So take that too Ather Jammoa."

04:52:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay. Will we be able to turn a profit maintaining all those stations by ourselves? I know Tara salvages a lot, but I wonder we collectively do it enough to pay for all that stuff."

04:52:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If we do, rather."

04:52:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:52:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well not as well as we could if we were working with other orgs but believe it or not, the Battle Scanner is rather inexpensive."

04:53:52 You nod and smile.

04:54:20 Shule runs his fingers through your hair and caresses your back.

04:54:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:54:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The Asteroid processors are pretty expensive and salvage Processors are moderately expensive. The Xenology is... let's see for what we qualify for... the lowest one which costs 8 megacredits but as I say artifacts bring in good income."

04:56:29 Shule runs his fingers through your hair and caresses your back.

04:56:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least for one station, I think the artifacts I'm holding will pay for it."

04:56:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:56:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We can get the Full Spectral Battle Scanner which only costs 2 megacredits and we're just 247 points shy of the next level Battle Scanner."

04:56:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "After that who knows, but I'm going to try to artifact for a while."

04:57:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Another thing we could do when the strike ends is organize that distant artifacting trip."

04:57:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I can just turn in the ones I'm holding out there."

04:57:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That would be great."

04:58:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though if we set a station up here and I cashed them in before we left I could bring a shuttle and save carrier space."

04:58:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:58:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well the most you can contribute towards points is 25 percent so if everyone would just contribute 5 percent or so, that would help but we primarily need command and we need a little push to get to the next level battle scanner which requires 2500 Combat."

04:59:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'd be happy to contribute as much as I can."

04:59:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."

04:59:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I don't mind contributing either."

04:59:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though there's no end to the strike in sight."

04:59:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That I can see, anyway."

04:59:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:59:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So I've never required any of you to contribute but occasionally meeting a goal where we all chip in is helpful but I won't hate you for it."

13:30:19 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

18:07:14 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:07:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

20:42:18 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

20:51:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Someones ship is smelling in new pheonix's garage."

20:51:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. do you know which ship?"

20:52:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Had the name 'Silver Starlight' on it."

20:52:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Whew, I just let out the biggest sigh of relief."

20:52:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was like oh crap, I checked the bowl on Monday."

20:53:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wheres the hair dresser again?"

20:53:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I need a haircut."

20:53:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:53:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Japan."

20:53:44 You scramble to your feet.

20:53:44 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:53:45 You exit the ship.

20:53:45 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

20:53:50 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

20:53:50 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:53:51 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:53:51 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:53:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:53:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:53:53 I don't understand that.

20:53:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:54:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:54:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:54:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:54:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:54:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:54:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:54:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:54:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:54:23 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Camp?"

20:54:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:54:24 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:54:24 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

20:54:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:54:27 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

20:54:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:54:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:54:29 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:54:31 AutoStar detects 5 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

20:54:32 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

20:54:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

20:54:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:54:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:54:58 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:55:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:55:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:55:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:55:14 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:55:14 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:55:19 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:55:46 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:55:55 Not much to see out there.

20:55:59 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

20:55:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:56:00 You exit the ship.

20:56:00 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You see a sanitation drone here.
You can go up.

20:56:01 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

20:56:02 Even though this starship garage smells like machine oil and heavy lubricants, it is spacious and well-lit. Massive hydraulic systems raise and lower starships to and from the landing pad above, and technicians and mechanics in silvery gray coveralls ensure that everything keeps running smoothly. A well-lit stairway which leads to the pilot's lounge is here. The distinct smell of death is emanating from the two-person medium transport "Silver Starlight".
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You see a sanitation drone here.
You can go up.

20:56:17 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:56:17 You can go northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, and west.

20:56:19  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

20:56:19 You are carrying nothing.

20:56:26 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:56:26 You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

20:56:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er yeah, Tara, it's um. Head North from the spaceport and then head Northeast at the fork, then it should be West on Japan somewhere."

20:56:31 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:56:32 You can go north, east, south, and west.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:59:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Jeez, anyone seen her lately? Hpefully that's not her."

20:59:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. hopefully."

20:59:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah, she probably just has felo in her ship that have died."

21:00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I just read the headlines.. someone got stabbed. that's awful. I don't care who they supported. When it comes to violence like that its wrong.."

21:03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I agree, but let's also not forget how that very same news outlet reported on the attack on Aisling."

21:05:40 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

21:06:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah."

21:06:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The bias is obvious."

21:06:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't want to jump to conclusions without knowing the full story, but that's just what it reminded me of is all."

21:10:15 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:14:15 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Hello? Anyone there?"

21:15:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

21:19:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im honestly a bit unnerved about the lack of news about outtcord."

21:20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's weird that it's been multiple weeks since van Dannikin was removed, and nothing has been said about his replacement yet."

21:20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The negotiations were supposed to end a week ago."

21:20:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You would think they would be in more of a rush."

21:20:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Maybe Best is having bureaucratic problems."

21:22:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I dunno, I doubt many people would want to be the negotiator for outcorrod, if Dannikin did what he did, how would other possible negotatiors be feeling about this now?"

21:22:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Good question."

21:23:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, I'm sure there are some people who might want to legitimately negotiate."

21:23:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like Kaisa Rebane, maybe."

21:23:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "She has said in the past that we're getting a raw deal and should renegotiate it."

21:23:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think if there were a way for us to stay in she would find it."

21:24:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's the clear compromise at this point, I agree."

21:24:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We stay in, but renegotiate the treaty is all."

21:24:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah but remember she's opposing best. Best wants us right out. Its unlikely he'll chose her unless he has no choice."

21:25:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sadly I don't think there'd be anyway for us to legitmately manipulate what choices he has."

21:25:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think if Best truly wanted us right out, we would just be out."

21:25:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How could anyone force negotiations on us?"

21:25:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She means from the Accord."

21:25:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I mean, too."

21:26:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh."

21:26:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if he legitimately had no intention of staying in under any circumstances, what would be the point of negotiating?"

21:26:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Who knows, though, I'm not in his head."

21:26:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

21:26:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Best wants to kick millions and millions of people from AEU space too, Con. People who migrated to our space. I doubt he has second thoughts about leavig the accord."

21:27:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Going through this charade for no reason just doesn't make much sense."

21:27:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well if we pull out without negotiationg a withdrawl, then we are in violation."

21:27:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er, without negotiating a withdrawl."

21:27:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But what can an organization we're not part of do to us to get us back for being in violation?"

21:27:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Stop trading with us? If they're smart that's on the table anyway."

21:28:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Restrict our navy movements to Union space? Again, this should all be part of the Accord's plan for us if we leave."

21:28:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I don't know."

21:28:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's just it, if we just pulled out and started doign whatever, we would still be contractually part of the Accord and thus in violation of the treaty."

21:28:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe it's not for us to understand."

21:28:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but if we want out, why would we care about being in violation of anything?"

21:28:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like what would they do?"

21:29:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Tell us we can't have the benefits of being in the Accord? Isn't that the point?"

21:29:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not sure exactly, but if we get out then the Accord won't get invovled unless we become a threat to humanity."

21:31:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You mean they might take their weekly money by force if we quit without negotiating a withdrawal?"

21:31:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, maybe that's true."

21:32:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's posturing, if I'm using that term correctly. They do'nt want to appear to be the bad guy in anything."

21:32:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "You've got the right term."

21:33:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I consider posturing basically political bluffing."

21:33:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's interesting. You're right, but we definitely appear to be the bad guy in everything."

21:33:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's why they blame the corps for the Mutuality tensions too, and why they try to make them sound liek super evil."

21:33:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Interestingly, the Mutuality also blames the corps for that."

21:34:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes, but not from the QSA thing."

21:34:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, what I meant both Aisling's and Anfisa's statements highlighted that the issue was that we had nothing of value to offer for access."

21:34:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The most recent tensions though, have been about that flotilla."

21:35:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, the QSAmeeting not going well was totally our fault, more specifically my fault probably."

21:35:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "As did Frolov's statements, relayed by Anfisa."

21:35:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, it wasn't your fault."

21:35:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "For sure, but that's not why the Mutuality is on edge about war though."

21:35:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think the blame rests on Vernos or on me."

21:35:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't remember if I had taken office by that point."

21:36:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I dn't remember, but I should have at least probably fully passed the torch on that one to one of you guys instead of trying to coordinate it while doing the other stuff. I certainly got some of Aislings messages mixed up."

21:37:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a small matter, from the statements I collected, I doubt any agreement could have been struck, or will be struck any time soon."

21:37:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:37:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm pretty sure I have an greement that would work, but I dno't think folks would go for it, we'd have to all agree fully."

21:37:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What is it?"

21:39:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably nto something for comms."

21:39:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. probably nto something for comms."

21:40:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Enacting a plan as a corps that we can't discuss within earshot of the government? Juicy."

21:40:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'd love to hear it sometime."

21:40:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

21:41:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's just an idea based on what I heard and what I read in those reports."

21:41:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Some of the statements allude to a plan of a similar nature."

21:41:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

21:41:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, what you said about the statements."

21:41:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think that's going to work. I have to admit, I'm not 100% comfortable promising that."

21:41:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean right now it works because they're the good guys and we're the bad guys, but what about six months from now?"

21:42:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think most of our pilots would be."

21:43:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would wager that the League and Fringe don't need to promise anything for access."

21:43:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think the problem is that they just don't like us."

21:43:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "For a variety of reasons."

21:43:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I'm sur ethey have their own agreemtns, just probably nothing like that."

21:43:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. I'm sure they have their own agreements, I mean."

21:44:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think it could be worded carefully though, to at least move closer to avoiding what you are saying about the future."

21:44:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And then what if our government found out?"

21:45:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder how they would take that."

21:45:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If I were Best, I would fire the entire corps immediately."

21:45:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though maybe he doesn't have the stones for that."

21:46:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's worded carefully, they'd have to be willing to admit something their not willing to admit to do anything about it."

21:46:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll write down what I mean for you in a bit."

21:47:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay. Is QSA access worth this can of worms, though?"

21:47:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'd be happy to look at it."

22:00:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There you go constantine."

22:01:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's definitely somethign we should all have a meeting about first."

22:14:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We need to get something going out there. Who's got a plan?"

22:15:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The plan is striiiiiiiike."

22:19:05 [Tactical Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Did anyone call for beacons?"

22:19:52 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Long time ago."

22:20:11 [Tactical Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Ah, that's too bad."

22:39:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

22:48:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

22:58:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:07:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I tried sniffing around the garage but it smells fantastic down there."

23:07:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "My morbid curiosity has instead fueled a desire for waffles."

23:08:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You sure, you can smell it if you take a closer look around."

23:08:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

23:09:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hmm, I guess maybe someone cleaned it up."

23:09:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It must have been cleaned."

23:10:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

23:10:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And sprayed with delicious waffle smell."

23:10:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."

23:10:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah man, I still smell it."

23:11:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, this agreement is so general that I think it would be okay. I guess if they would agree to it, I would."

23:12:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It would surprise me though. There are what, about half a dozen of us who are active in any sense? We can't really promise what this implies."

23:12:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "This would basically just be for their peace of mind."

23:12:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I guess if they're fine with, I'm fine with."

23:17:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We need to get something going out there. Who's got a plan?"

23:17:44 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've got a plan, stop Outccord before it's too late."

23:47:35 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:47:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

23:47:46 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

23:47:47 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

23:47:47 Even though this starship garage smells like machine oil and heavy lubricants, it is spacious and well-lit. Massive hydraulic systems raise and lower starships to and from the landing pad above, and technicians and mechanics in silvery gray coveralls ensure that everything keeps running smoothly. A well-lit stairway which leads to the pilot's lounge is here. The distinct smell of death is emanating from the two-person medium transport "Silver Starlight".
You can go up.
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo allo Bob."

23:47:57 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Pierre, I think Melinda is looking for someone to date. Send applications. There is no grander individual than the Pierre."

23:56:06 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "That's okay pierre, people tend to have better luck between periods."

23:56:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew snickers.

23:56:25 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Follow the cycle."

23:56:27 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's alright, she said she's only intrested in blue guys anyways, anyone know anyone like that?"

23:56:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

23:56:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did she now?"

23:56:47 [General Communication] Joel Kringle whistles.

23:56:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

23:56:53 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Plenty of weird vials to drink."

23:56:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And I can't say's I do."

23:56:58 [General Communication] Joel Kringle snickers.

23:57:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I better be quiet, I'm gonna end up getting punched."

23:57:20 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "By all means continue. I'm not going to get punched."

23:58:52 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Eli come back I miss you."
