15:39 I see no "report" here.

15:39  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

15:39 You are carrying nothing.

15:39 You grab the door handle as you leave.

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

15:39 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo here.
You can go south and out.

15:39 Board what?

15:39 Board what?

15:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

You can go south and out.

15:39 I can't find "sofa."

15:40 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

15:43 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

15:47 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

15:50 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

15:50 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

15:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

15:51 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

15:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

15:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 286,300.12 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

16:00 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

16:04 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

16:11 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

16:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Hey julius, I have extra copies of that book if you want it. I can give it to you after finishing this mission."

16:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Thanks friend, but i've already got one. Just not read it carefully enough."

16:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah ok. Well if anyone else needs one, just let me know."

16:19 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Was merely pointing out a number of types of work and if you pace yourself and not do just one type of work all of the time, you won't become too bored with your work and a paycheck once per week form one type of work isn't a bad thing. Also, courier helps you learn about other places and you can explore those while you are out couriering which breaks up the monotony."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It might still be tough in a fighter that you can field currently, though. If you're going to do that, think about renting a fighter from tannhauser."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah, interesting. Those are fun."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "I saw a nest today, didn't do anything about it."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You typically need a crew of 4 for a nest."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Will do. I've been hesitant to get a fighter now anyway since I can't really get upgrades yet."

20:08 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Xenological Solar Temporary Station in The Belt of Orion.

20:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I think those are both space and ground combat."

20:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Finally we'll get somethign from xenology."

20:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Oh my, not much weapon power in the cargo hauler... let's hope I meet no enemies..."

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "But yes, enemies... flitter times."

20:11 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo jumps down from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap.

20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I can't wait to get better ships and maybe a place to sleep besides my captain's chair."

20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.

20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith laughs.

20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a really roomy one, though."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Ah yes, the good old days. At least I don't have to sleep under those admitedly very clean plastisteel bridges on the main concourse."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Well if it has living quarters with a bed, it's better than this one roomed space."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah, so do I. It's not a bad place to sleep, either."

20:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup I still sleep in a shp 99 percent of the time as well. You can buy sleeping bags over on Mars and you can always put a bed in the store room which is where I slept until I qualified for a gunship which has living quarters."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want a place on New Earth, but I don't like living underground."

20:13 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

20:14 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Or.. you can put a hammock up in the storeroom, too."

20:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I do rent one of those underground bunkers but I rarely go there. I rent it for that untimely event that we might need a place to go under cover. Hopefully that will never occur but I dislike where they are located."

20:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "They're located in landfall, aren't they?"

20:17 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

20:17 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

20:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The apartments on new Earth are located just a couple of blocks form the Central exit out of the Spaceport."

20:18 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There is a complex in landfall, but pilots can't currently rent there."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wish we could."

20:18 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "The battlesuit rapid deployment is there."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "You can talk to the technition at SVP, to have him send it back to new earth."

20:20 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "And how do I get it to Space Vermin?"

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah ok."

20:20 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Jump to vermin. FTL vermin..."

20:20 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "The tech at space vermin will move it to and from space vermin for you."

20:20 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks."

20:20 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh, you mean battlesuits. Sorry, I missed part of that I guess."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a gloss
20:31 y silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

20:31 I don't see "lilky" here.

20:31 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

20:40 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

20:42 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

20:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Wow... luxury long-range sightseers... nice."

20:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "That.. would truely be a remarkable ship to take passengers on."

20:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh it's my primary ship. But I'm also an exploration nut."

20:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It can only hold two passengers though."

20:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Heh."

20:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

20:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ever took anyone on a... expidition?"

20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not a real expidition,  no. I've gone out a few hundred lightyears with a partner or two though. I'l be putting together a platform soon enough, just waiting to see if ATher can do anything about the skims first."

20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If he can't,  then I'll be doing a bare bones expidition."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh.. I was meaning with paying passengers, one might pick up at the passenger station."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've wasted too much time trying to get 3 long-ranged sightseers for a platform. I think i'm just gonna borrow a couple from some other pilots."

20:50 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  no that would be really awesome though."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah, that's what I mean. It would be."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Like pick up a couple of people that just want to explore for a while and see space? I'd be all over that."

20:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I wonder if that's possible... since that's what that ship seems to be made for."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never seen any passengers requesting a trip like that."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Though, it's an approval required ship."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's less luxurious cousin isn't, though."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And is still a passenger ship."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the main difference is that the long-ranged has more charge and living quarters."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yep."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, smjallest ship with a shower."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I'm there, now.. looking at them."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. smallest."

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, it has a shower?"

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's awesome."

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I had to buy a deluxe shower for my regular one."

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I'd have one on the artifact trip."

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Double the hours.."

20:54 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It should only have 2 more hours, right?"

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep,  anything with a living quarters has a shower. I didn't notice it at first because it's in the storage room on the sightseer."

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Showers, living quarters.."

20:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It's the idea ship for any small, private exploration vessel."

20:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "With 20 hours of charge, instead of 10!"

20:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The normal one has 18."

20:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah.."

20:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Same as the exploration scout."

20:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "These ships you can pick up passengers with, though..."

20:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm just saying the normal one has 18 hours of charge, not 10."

20:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "I'm a little lost on Space Vermin. Got my suit here but can't figure out where to request a mission."

20:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh.. you're right. it is 18. My bad."

20:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Miss read the specs."

20:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "If you go south to the gally and then up the stairs, you'll find the control center, that's where you get missions."

20:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "South from the landing."

20:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks."

21:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "AH HA! I've found the bane of my essistance!... or, more like the bane of my credits exsistance.."

21:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What... should I buy!"

21:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Small? Standard? Large? Fancy? So hard to choose!"

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Ask your girlfriend, and you'll have no doubt."

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Thank the heavens I don't have one."

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits an irritating burst of static.

21:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Giggles."

21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "And... the different sizes... hmm...."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Exactly what are you looking at. Clothes? Jewelry? Hats?"

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think holovids."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Don't think impressively large holovid would fit in my flitters storetoom.."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "No clue what those are."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "There's a holovid in the pilot lounge.. if I recall."

21:08 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There is, you just can't get SSN on it."

21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can, however, get SSN on the one at Chet's Grill."

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Eli, I need you glowing blue wisdom..."

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Should I, or should I not buy this impressively large holovid for my flitter?"

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Maybe smaler."

21:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Smaller.."

21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I am trying to figure out if it would fit..."

21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs chuckles.

21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it would fit."

21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I mean, it depends on how much more stuff you want to put in there. If you don't care about the space then go for it. You can always move into an apartment later."

21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh this is neat."

21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Me too.."

21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I'm planning to move to a larger ship."

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I've decided!"

21:12 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

21:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I went with the only option!"

21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "A... mini."

21:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ahem.. where does one find those showers?"

21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you might be able to buy some on Ardsley, but I got mine off SSN."

21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ah."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "How usefull is a flashlight? Really?"

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Some say that the light stuns roid dogs."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Giving you enough time to escape."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs chuckles.

21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I'm willing to bet the repellant might work better so you can actually haul the roid. But I've never had the pleasure, or pain... of running into one yet."

21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Nor have I."

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Is there a photocopier anywhere in the liaison office?"

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Not sure."

21:20 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior pulsates gently.

21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think all the officers have them."

21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In their offices."

21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say org trustee offices have them as well."

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you can't buy on Chetumal, I'll copy something for you when I'm back in home space."

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Buy a photocopier, that is."

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh, I bought one at landfall, when I was getting the holovid."

21:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Roid dogs are real."

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Seen them, artus?"

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Seen them, eli?"

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who was that one cadet? Fidel Besacabres?"

21:24 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "He went out hauling and was never seen again."

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "No idea where that came from."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nope, never seen one, or heard one. But I've also never seen gunarsh or Euclid."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I have though, seen the hatch of a ship after one was tearing into it."

21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What's a gunarsh?"

21:28 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Sheesh. So now I got my battlesuit to Vermin, selected a mission but now I can't figure out how to start the mission."

21:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "New:grumbles."

21:29 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox grumbles.

21:29 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Deploy, then launch."

21:29 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Deploy doesn't work, already tried that."

21:29 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Are you in deployment?"

21:29 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or still with the commander?"

21:29 [Newbie Help] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "First: Is your suit there?"

21:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Doh."

21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Nevermind."

21:30 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Nevermind, now it makes sense."

21:30 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox chuckles.

21:30 [Newbie Help] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hmm?"

21:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "He said it was. Justin, go to the deployment place."

21:31 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Hmm, the commander only had space missions it seems."

21:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That happens sometimes. Since there are more than 5 missions, and you can only do 5 a day, they vary them up."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "How do I find the beacons that he mentioned?"

21:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't forget about low priority deployments, and I believe the AEU has a ground mission other than that."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "I launched into space but didn't see any beacons."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "What did he say about them? There are different kinds of beacons in SC."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Yup, did a bunch of low missions. Need to dig myself out of my negative points."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox laughs.

21:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Get on a crew with other pilots to do space stuff, do salvaging, deliveries, mail...I think someone recommended a book that describes a lot of the activities to you recently."

21:34 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

21:34 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "I need to find some RATS."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's from an in-character perspective, but you might find it helpful."

21:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...for Rats, try any beaconed sector with debris. Orion, Spinward Cluster, Dusty Reaches...places like that."

21:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a book available in the book store, a beacon clusters handbook. You might find that helpful."

21:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll get industry for turning in the cores to the guy in the docking bay at SVP."

21:36 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Ok, let me check on that book."

21:37 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It won't be at the space market, mind you. It will be in the bookstores on capital planets."

21:38 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

21:40 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 286,286.07 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

21:40 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

21:41 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Are Bari spreader corpses debris chunks?"

21:41 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."

21:41 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Ok, thanks."

21:42 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

21:44 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

21:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I wonder if Katina's disapperance had something to do with it?"

21:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What channel is SNN?"

21:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "SSN. If you look on your holo's tuner it should be listed as such."

21:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ah, found it."

21:51 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Is there a way to scan chunks, to find out if they are corpses?"

21:51 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "DEBRIS."

21:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hrm... a copper keyring, for 19.99 eaos?"

21:51 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Debris only scans one, as far as I know, right?"

21:52 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll get a better scanner as you get more industry points. It'll scan further out."

21:52 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "As your points go up, other scanners will become available to you that will scan at a wider range."

21:52 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What Morris said."

21:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want to store your ship keys in style."

21:53 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Cool, but doesn't help me much, in searching for bari spread corpses right now."

21:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah... no kidding. But, that's really cheap."

21:53 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It helps some. Just scan sections of the sector at a time. I think the one you have now goes out 4 or 6 units."

21:53 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "All I can suggest is that you move close to each chunk and scan it. It'll take time, but it works."

21:53 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Either that or just move to each chunk and scan it."

21:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They really only insanely overcharge us on phone service and rent and stuff."

21:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We pretty much pay normal people prices for clothing and food and what not."

21:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

21:54 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Oh my, I need to find 20 of them, but at least that's a solusion."

21:55 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It should have said so many units...which isn't how many chunks. It's how the pieces you pull off add up in your storage."

21:55 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "You are right, I can't read. 10000."

21:56 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "So check your storage as you pull those off with the STORAGE command or I think CARGO works the same. Once you have at least 10K units, transfer it somewhere and complete the mission."

21:57 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Yes, will do that, when I find them."

21:57 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Things will get easier. But there are many ways to make industry points."

21:58 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

21:58 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Yes, I just follow the guide lines, and do vermin missions, and finding corpses is one of them."

21:59 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

22:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs sighs.

22:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "And.. I was about to send Katina something in the mail.. too."

22:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why can't you?"

22:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Wpn't be any use till she is brought back."

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you meant you were going to send her something before she disappeared."

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought you meant you tried just now and couldn't."

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "No... I was thinking about it, then remember that's she's disappeared."

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Was it a muffin?"

22:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

22:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "So.. where at ardsley is this shower?"

22:07 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it's there, but I could be wrong. I also don't remember exactly which store it would be in."

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But there is one that sells soap and other showering supplies."

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's a shower on Ardsley?"

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think."

22:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No idea."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought there was, but it's been quite some time since I looked."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe it was on Mars."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Well.. I'm about to find out if there is or not."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Only place I know of to get collapsalbe showers are at the Helios mall."

22:08 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hmm.."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could swear I've seen them for sale someplace else, but maybe not."

22:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's not to say there's not some other place. That's just the only place I know of."

22:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Mmmm... chili cheeseburger."

22:18 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

22:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That sounds heavenly."

22:21 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How do I get rid of an amunition storage box if I don't need it now?"

22:21 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Expel it."

22:22 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Thanks."

22:22 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yup."

22:24 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

22:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Nothing there."

22:30 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn, sorry. I guess try Mars, and if you can't find anything there, see if someone can fly you out to Helios."

22:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you're looking for a less permanent solution, there's a pool bar down on the beach in New Phoenix that allows free use of the showers."

22:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And they're quite nice."

22:36 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

22:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "A shower caddie?"

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's just to carry your shower stuff around."

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To hold your soap and what not."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah.."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I highly recommend Accord victory soap."

22:45 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, that stuff smells great."

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hmm? Which stuff?"

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Accord victory soap."

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ah."

22:54 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "KO Pick'em'up". The organization has earned 399,200.94 credits.

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "So I moved out of a beaconed sector. How do I find those darn RATS?"

22:55 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you looking for rats to fight?"

22:56 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They do move into and out of sectors, but I wouldn't wait around for that to happen."

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you don't see any, move on to another sector."

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you're doing this out in uncharted space, be very careful not to get lost."

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But even if you do, you can just holler and we'll come find you."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's usually no need to go hunting in uncharted space if all you want is rats kills, though. You can check your D-04's, your Belts of Orion, your A-23's, and so forth."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're bound to find rats hiding in one of those places."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Only steer clear of reapers."

23:02 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

23:03 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

23:04 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

23:07 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo gazes at Shine the big white glowing felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

23:07 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo, and both animals purr softly.

23:11 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

23:15 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

23:19 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

23:23 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What's the command to check all the status info for mining, and the command to change what drones do? I done forgot."

23:23 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

23:23 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Suppary, and tasks respectively."

23:23 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Summary*."

23:23 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Woo thanks."

23:24 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "There is also the status command that gives you a quick overall view of what's going on."

23:24 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:27 Shine the big white glowing felo suddenly jumps onto a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top.

23:31 [Newbie Help] Clint Ranger transmits, "How do I save."

23:31 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't."

23:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Just type quit."

23:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Assuming you mean log out."

23:31 [Newbie Help] Clint Ranger transmits, "Yes."

23:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "The in character understanding for that is that you go to sleep."

23:31 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The game autosaves like every half hour,e very hour, something like that. Generally though, if you quit out, try to quit somewhere private. Inside of a landed starship of yours, a house, an apartment, something."

23:32 [Newbie Help] Clint Ranger transmits, "Thanks will do."

23:32 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That is not the only in-character understanding of quitting."

23:32 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

23:32 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh it was all I knew of, what else?"

23:33 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Especially if you quit somewhere where only you generally have access to. You can say you're doing something else. In fact, you kind of relaly should say that you're doing other things. It doesn't make a horrible amount of sense to go to sleep like 5-6 times a day at least, as some are prone to do."

23:33 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Aha."

23:33 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Almost anything that is within the realm of belief, honestly. By realm of belief, I mean, something that a pilot would be able/allowed to do."

23:34 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Like saying you need to go for a meeting or something. Because as Ather said. It doesn't make sense that you'd sleep a bunch of times a day."

23:34 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:34 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You could say that you put your comm away, veged out and watched holovid for a while. Watched films. Maybe went shopping."

23:34 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "But that would be so great."

23:34 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Read a book. Etc, etc."

23:35 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo gazes at Shine the big white glowing felo for a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"

23:38 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

23:39 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo seems to be hungry.

23:39 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo approaches a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

23:42 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

23:43 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

23:43 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo, and both animals purr softly.

23:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident scrambles to her feet.

23:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

23:46 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

23:47 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

23:47 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, purring softly.

23:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

23:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

23:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

23:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

23:48 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

23:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:48 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

23:49 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Blah, how do you do socials in the mids of communications again?"

23:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

23:49 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Like I just tried to do on general."

23:49 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Like tr gen laugh 'you're crazy."

23:49 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The way that you should've done it would've been something like tr gen chuckle 'yes yes I know that wasn't funny."

23:49 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:50 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Take careful note of the punctuations used."

23:50 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok. Think the apostrophe there made sense."

23:50 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, except for the period and the end quotation mark at the end."

23:50 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "And if you use the custom ones, don't be like me and always forget the closing quotations."

23:50 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep!"

23:51 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Think of it like you would when you're actually speaking to someone. Just remember the tr gen beforehand."

23:51 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against a dark purple leather captain's chair, purring softly.

23:51 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What if I want the social not at the beginning."

23:52 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then emote it. So, you would do something like: tr gen :"I am a funny guy, aren't I?" He chuckles. "OK, I guess I'm not.""

23:52 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Then you'd need to um...there's a way to do it with the greater than and less than things. but I never remember how to do that."

23:52 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't actually know if those work in transmitions."

23:53 [Newbie Help] Johann Schraft transmits, "They do."

23:53 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I think they do, but I could be wrong."

23:53 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, then yeah. Read help advanced socials."

23:53 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That'll help you lots."

23:53 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:53 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Morris's suggestion makes sense in any case."

23:53 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "And nod, to that help advanced emoting thing."

23:54 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

23:58 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.
