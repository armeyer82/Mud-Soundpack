Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling
bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red
aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling
ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice
Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid
security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Attention pilots: it would seem that some
people might've believed that I gave instructions to other office holders not to
approve pending credit transfers. That's absolutely false. Any office holder can
approve any credit transfer as long as it's for a -good- reason; buying
something from someone, paying for a plant from an organization, etc etc. Don't
get carried away with ridiculous stuff, but yes, any office holder can and
-should- approve credit transfers that are made for a good and valid reason that
doesn't revolve around just giving friends or new pilots money. [21:18 27
