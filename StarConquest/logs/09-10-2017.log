-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars, a pair of tan suede clogs, a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes, Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.

13:30:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:30:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:31:01 The ship is already moving.

13:31:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:31:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:31:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:31:08 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

13:31:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:31:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:31:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:31:14 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

13:31:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:31:49 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

13:31:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

13:31:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:32:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:32:05 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:32:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:04:44 You grin.

18:05:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I still have cores form Joel and I can get a top from Rune still and so I'd just need the ejecter which can no longer be Invaders."

18:14:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

18:14:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:14:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We have about a day left on the current BAS."

18:14:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:14:22 You say, "Ah, ok."

18:14:23 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:14:23 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:14:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:14:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That we're still on but obviously everyone is out in the other area so nobody will use and we won't earn anything."

18:14:55 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:15:04 You ask, "Which are?"

18:15:09 You ask, "Area?"

18:15:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They all went out of comms to do salvage ops."

18:15:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And of course left us off."

18:16:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have no intentions of going out to be social with them."

18:16:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Remember I asked you if I could take you out there with me?"

18:16:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hopefully you weren't too sleepy heh."

18:16:42 You say, "Oh yeah."

18:17:10 You nod.

18:18:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will laugh because you see, Morris won't earn any megacredits nor command for probably a couple of months and he will be just beside himself heh."

18:19:32 You chuckle. "Exactly."

20:55:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:55:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:55:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:55:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:55:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:56:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.
