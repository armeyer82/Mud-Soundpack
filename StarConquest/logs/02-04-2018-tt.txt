Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater
minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, a bright orange crate,
and a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver
fringe here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow.

Introduction:
This book details all of the upgrades and ships that the AEU can get from their
own planets and from other planets and stations. Everything has its own special
section (see table of contents on the next page). If you're ever confused by
anything or think that it's missing from the book, feel free to check the
additional info available at most ship upgrade stores. Should you believe that
there's anything that I missed, or which you think might be wrong, feel free to
mail me about it so that it can be corrected in a future edition. Don't tell me
about it on comms, I will more than likely miss it if you do.
Note: this book will contain only starship statistics and class modifications.
The descriptions advertising these ships shown in stores will not be included. I
will offer a brief and in some instances, a more detailed descriptions of
starships and capabilities. The class modifications are mostly combat-oriented,
but I have tried to include them for all vessels since people have requested
this in the past. Furthermore, please note that I did not include pricing for
application starships, this is intentional. Keep checking back for updated
editions!

Requirements: 700 combat points
Maximum Targets: 3 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%
Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method
against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go
after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is
going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track
of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target
retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement
information and send that information to your gunners.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect
solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver
wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her shoulder. Her
head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both
elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist, both hips,
groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both feet are left
uncovered.

Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method
against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go
after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is
going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track
of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target
retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement
information and send that information to your gunners.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Bikura

Torpedos are among the most commonly used weapons in a space battle. A fair few
launchers have decent hull bonuses, and all launchers pack a fairly reasonable
punch and don't suck the combat grid's energy dry. However, some of the
higher-grade torpedo launchers do require considerable energy, and take longer
to fire.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone
here.
Pete Storm is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
