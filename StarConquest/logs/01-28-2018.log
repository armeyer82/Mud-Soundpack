00:09 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Either that or who might be interested in midnight combat missions?"

00:29 Lily Kaise says, "Heh right."

00:30 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I turned general on and hadn't in weeks literally."

00:30 Lily Kaise asks, "And what do I hear?"

00:30 You say, "Nah, he said something over tactical about beacons or combat missions."

00:31 Lily Kaise says, "Well I also turned general on and no I thought precisely the same when he called for missions or beacons."

00:31 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:31 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

00:31 You glance at your communicator's screen.

00:31 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Attention pilots: it would seem that some people might've believed that I gave instructions to other office holders not to approve pending credit transfers. That's absolutely false. Any office holder can approve any credit transfer as long as it's for a -good- reason; buying something from someone, paying for a plant from an organization, etc etc. Don't get carried away with ridiculous stuff, but yes, any office holder can and -should- approve credit transfers that are made for a good and valid reason that doesn't revolve around just giving friends or new pilots money. [21:18 27 January 2318 GST]
There are two board posts.

00:31 Lily Kaise says, "I also don't respond to any of League's call for nests or otherwise."

00:31 You say, "Neither do I."

00:32 Lily Kaise says, "Ugh well Ather blasted me for declining the credit transfer when Vernos sent that credit chip to Melinda."

00:32 You say, "Oh."

00:33 Lily Kaise says, "I jsut responded I was glad that he clarified things. It sure took him awhile to do so though."

00:33 You say, "YEah, no kidding."

00:33 Lily Kaise points at a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

00:33 You say, "I read the notice."

00:33 You say, "Vernos didn't tell us until after he had tried to transfer the credits the reason for it."

00:34 Lily Kaise says, "Right and he knew there was an issue. Had he done so, I would have approved it and dealt with Ather later."

00:34 You nod.

00:35 Lily Kaise says, "I know we both had the impression that ather didn't want us to approve those unless he indicated otherwise."

00:35 You nod.

00:35 You say, "Well, at least he finally cleared that up."

00:36 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah of course but it just gave him another reason to give me a difficult time about something. Seriously though it took him how long... to finally make a statement?"

00:37 You say, "At least a month, from what I remember."

00:37 Lily Kaise says, "If not longer."

00:37 You nod.

04:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:15 I can't find "couch."

04:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:16 You sit down on a tiger stripe leather sofa.

04:16 Lily Kaise sits down on a tiger stripe leather sofa.

04:16 The ship is already moving.

04:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:16 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:16 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:16 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Kalina! Welcome to home space!"

04:16 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

04:16 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

04:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:16 Lily Kaise says, "I have no idea what I want to call it heh."

04:16 You laugh.

04:16 You say, "Don't call it Patriot."

04:16 Lily Kaise says, "Heck no."

04:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:16 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalina. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:17 You laugh.

04:17 Lily Kaise stands up from a tiger stripe leather sofa.

04:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:17 You stand up from a tiger stripe leather sofa.
