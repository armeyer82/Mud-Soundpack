Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

get application
You remove a starship requisition application from a leather briefcase.
read application
1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own.
What do you do and why?
You entered: First, I attempt to destroy any interdictors that may impede my
escape. Following that, I engage any ships that would prevent my departure such
as any chaining ships or ships that are interdicting. I then engage and attempt
to destroy  as many of the remaining ships as I can one at a time. My first and
foremost goal is to do everything I can to ensure that I have the ability to
leave the sector if necessary. Second, I want to destroy as many of the enemy
ships as I can so as to prevent them getting closer to civilian locations and
providing a very real threat.
2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
You entered: I would still take the same approach as in the question above with
the exception of the fact that I would alert everyone over tactical regarding my
location, number, and class of ships. I also would request others to respond to
assist. With it being a civilian location, it is my duty and responsibility to
do everything I can to protect and defend it. Therefore, I would fight as long
as necessary until the enemy is repelled or I run out of ships to fly.
3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships depend
largely on grid, I don't like running out of grid and the engineer can improve
the recharge time of the grid by using advanced tools. Since the engineer needs
to be settled in order to use them, I prefer to have the engineer always be
ready to recharge the grid or patch the hull in case the ship is hit. 
4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving
soon. What actions do you take?
You entered: I notify everyone over tactical of my situation ensuring that I
state number and classes of enemy ships. I then attempt to clear a way for me to
leave the sector by destroying any interdictors if there are only a few of them
and I try to destroy any ships that have me chained to them. If there are many
interdictors and they are too spread out, I may not be able to destroy them
before more are launched. My best option here then is to keep constantly moving
away from the enemy to give the engineer time to repair the hull and for
reinforcements to arrive. Landing in the sector is really the last thing I would
do unless I felt I had no choice as the engineer cannot use advanced tools to
patch the hull.
5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
You entered: We destroy any small ships that may have accompanied the mothership
and leave the sector and notify both Steel Phoenix Command and Accord and don't
return without a cruiser that as PDB shielding and battle suits. The last
mothership could not be destroyed by conventional weapons so attacking it would
be futile.
6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what
would be your priority and why?
You entered: My priority would be to protect primary beacon sectors and capitol
planets. Primary beacon sectors are gateways to capitol planets and the enemy
could inhibit a our ability to defend and protect the capitol planet by
interdicting primary sectors. Capitol planets have the highest population of
civilians and is home to our government and therefore should be protected.
7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing
commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?
You entered: I would carry out any orders the commander issued  and encourage my
crew to do the same within reason.
8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issued
missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?
You entered: I have flown in several salvage ops against, Omega Cartel, "Lambda
Cartel and Merry Band ships. I have also responded and fought against siege
forces both in AEU space and in other alliance space.
9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?
You entered: I still get hit more often than I'd like.
10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?
You entered: I expect it to stay undamaged less than a day as I plan to take it
out and test it in a beacon as soon as I obtain one. I often get hit at least
once during a decoy beacon drop.
11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?
You entered: I'm going to do everything I can to ensure it does not get
destroyed, but if it does, it will most likely be during an invasion.
12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?
You entered: Defensive dissidence. I have the title of Phoenix Dissidence , and
I obtained this ship to help defend the AEU.
13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while
fighting. What song do you choose?
You entered: Thunderstruck by ACDC
14. What is your favorite color?
You entered: Red

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien

               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! Everyone, while I am pleased to
see you attempting to engage in Ground Combat work, please be certain not to
forget to watch your battlesuit's damage, repair in between battles, take cover
if your damage is high and use Repair drones to obtain enough repairs, however
small they are, so that you can launch and obtain a repair from the Battlesuit
Outfitter. If you need tips on managing your Ground Combat tactics, please seek
us out and discuss your questions and concerns. Also, on the conference room
table of the Liaison Office building, there is a box which contains two
different books on Ground Combat. I suggest that you take and read these books.
Regarding another type of work, SEAS has deployed a Temporary Salvage Processing
Station in the sector which is just East of Steel Phoenix Command. Simply
perform your salvaging work, jump to Steel Phoenix Command, move to 20, 1, 1.
Then switch to Manual Piloting Mode and move east by 1 which navigates you out
of the Steel Phoenix Command sector. You should be adjacent to the Salvage
processing Station. Land on the Temporary Station and transfer your debris.
Before you leave, exit your starship and go up to the Control Room and press the
'TRANSFER' button. Then return to your starship, launch, and if you are at 1, 1,
1 then reverse the direction you original navigated to return to the steel
Phoenix Command sector. You can then fly onto your next desired destination. The
advantage to you is there are no Rats or Pirates to deal with, you will earn
more for your debris by transferring to a Temporary Salvage processing station
which is sponsored by an organizations or preferably more than one organization.
In this instance, you will earn AEU credits as well. We hope to establish a new
Battle Scanner for beacon drops and Xenology Researching Temporary Space
Stations over the weekend. We are seeking other organizations participation with
these projects as well. In the meantime, fly safely! And fight hard on the
ground! [14:03  3 February 2318 GST]

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth;
Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go down and out.

power
You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
ftl drydock
You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given
undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the
stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector
Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and
darkened, and the ISC is no more.
A large frame hangs in space here, sufficiently large to at least contain a
battlecruiser-class starship.
Via general sector communication, Shipyard Structure transmits in a robotic
voice, "Detecting vessel 'Defensive Dissidence.' Welcome to Capital Ship
Drydock."

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go down and out.

Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that
bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation
order is entered."
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Defensive

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth;
Spaceport Landing Pad.

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from Lily Kaise on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Greetings
SEAS! We have sponsored 3 income-producing Temporary Space Stations. These
Temporary Space Space stations are -- a BAS in the sector West of Steel Phoenix
Command, a Salvage Processor in the Sector just East of Steel Phoenix Command
and a Xenology Scanner which is just east of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector.
Please inform new AEU pilots on how to navigate to these stations as they will
benefit from earning more income from their work as they pay less taxes on their
income for utilizing a Temporary Space Station. Hence, this shows the abject
ignorance of the League Alliance regarding not wanting the AEU to benefit. It is
moreso that they want to punish AEU pilots for what the Worst administration has
done. Unfortunately, I couldn't obtain approval to utilize jointly contributed
modules from SEAS and Starseekers and Invaders did not respond to at least three
separate invitations to participate. Hopefully over time they will want to
participate as I don't feel comfortable with these stations being sponsored
soley on behalf of SEAS. Another exciting development is SEAS can now convert
Credits to Megacredits. So as long as we have Credits to convert to Megacredits,
we can continue to contribute to Temporary Space Stations or build them on our
own. Fly safe! And fight hard on the ground! [14:34  4 February 2318 GST]

awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
