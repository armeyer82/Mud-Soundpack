00:40 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wal

17:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

17:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:58 The ship is already moving.

17:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:42 [Starship "Vengeance"; Control Room]

18:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:35 You peer into stairway to the pilot's lounge...

19:35 
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.

[Starship "Albatross"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm trying to get to 2000 before the trip."

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Will I get less than a point from bubble artifacts after 2000?"

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I didn't do it."

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "What's wrong Katie?"

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Wait... What does that mean? 2000 points?"

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Is this exploration points or..."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Where's aytheor when I need to shoot someone."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Exploration, yeah."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "What's wrong, Katie? Did someone bitch at you?"

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah, I have only got over 1000."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I started to get only one and a half after 1500."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "So I work hard hard hard to get 100 scp for the dang asteroid hauler, and only then does the techie bother to tell me. *in a high pitched voice* ooo, nooo, I can't sell that to a cadet."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Er, after 1000."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And one after 1500."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm thinking if I get to 2000 before this trip, my bubbling days could be done afterwards."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry Katie."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm sorry Katie. I can come back and we can haul in my asteroid hauler if you wish."

20:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "These cadets want everything all at once!"

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, the only ships cadets can get are the flitter, hauler, and fighter."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Oh my, when do we become pilots."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "After you have submitted your paperwork and it is approved."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I love the bubble. It's my favorite place ever, though if I don't have to bubble anymore, I think I'd still bubble because of the cash."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Quite alright, evangelin, shtone and I are about to do tesla, it juts annoys me."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright. Well I hope everything works out for you, darling."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The cash actually gets a lot worse after 1500. I used to get about 10 million per artifact, now I don't even get 1 million."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Well shit."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Feh, don't count on getting your paperwork approved this side of Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event. Mines been in their for 2 to 3 weeks."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Goddess, really?"

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Serious? Lily, you must have a billion exploration points."

20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope I don't."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I have over 1,010 exploration points."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Curious, this artifacting you speak of, how does it work."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have a good bit but not a million haha."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's the best. You just fly around in your ship looking for stuff to pick up."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I can show you when you get high enough. I believe you have to be over 300 points license, before you can go exploring?"

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's actually my favorite thing to do."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That and scooping."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I enjoy it as well."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But scooping is out."

20:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah, scooping."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Awww... Yeah, I don't know if we can go over there and get stuff now. Though Ather said it was possible?ish?"

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well you can explore for local Artifacts in Battle of Mir or in Alpha 777 but you can't really qualify to turn artifacts from the Bubble and other areas until you have 300 Exploration."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's also a huge pain without autovector."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And a moderate pain without a fast ship."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Right."

20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Heeh, I love autovector."

20:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "That was one of the first things I got for Celtic when I made it into an exploration ship. Autovector."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Looking back on those SVP missions, I can't believe I used to manually move 8 sectors out to find the rat probes and stuff."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess looking for a nest is sort of like that."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't seem as bad though."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yeah but... Oh yeah I forgot the rat killers don't have autovec. Or they can't be upgraded with it. Bummer."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Waiiit, you have to go 8 sectors out for that mission? That explains... a lot."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Meaning the Mule, because they have a fortress."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eventually you will, yeah."

20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yeah."

20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "That explains a lot. Does it matter what direction?"

20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, usually the commander will be like, oh we tracked a probe coming in from the up."

20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Before it ran out of power! Or whatever."

20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And you'll know you have to fly up until you find it."

20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Ah."

20:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "That's interesting. Thanks."

20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It will indicate a direction like coming from the up or similar."

20:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Man, AEU supremacy right now."

20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Did you escape?"

20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Didin't have to."

20:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we won't be able to finish this."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "You escaped, he shot me, I shot him back, and he fled."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't escape, he got me."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie transmits cusses

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, it's no big deal."

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm unharmed."

20:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline laughs quietly. "Cursing is ideal. I did it quite a bit sometimes."

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Shall I end the mission?"

20:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

20:53 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Two for a nest?"

21:14 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "I'm trying to locate a RATS probe near Beacon A-23 that's adrift without power. What's the best way to search for it?"

21:14 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Go in the direction they told you it was coming from."

21:14 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Head in the direction you were given when you were assigned the mission."

21:15 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Ah yeah.. someone just said that earlier."

21:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Woo."

21:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Woo."

21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire chuckles.

21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "That's what I thought. Must be some kind of fancy dialect."

21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "We say woo woo woo woo woo hoo, when we say hello how are you?'" Evangeline Adaire laughs.

21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah crap I went the wrong way. Taht is what I get for joking around."

21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ah well I guess I will just have to correct it then..."

21:33 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "The target computer that announces "target is North and up", is that an upgrade you can fit?"

21:34 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "No it's just the tracking computer."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I think all ships have it, but it can be upgraded."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Hmmm, mine doesn't tell me where the ships are in relation to me."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "The pilot operates it by typing track and choosing the ship."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Ah, gotcha."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Not sure how you'll know that in character though."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "The track command is what I needed."

21:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Probably from their training in flight school."

21:35 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, it'll list targets within range."

21:40 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's fairly frequent visits from Kelsey and IFS out there Kert."

21:40 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Hmm."

21:40 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Maybe I should wait till I'm better upgraded, or have help along?"

21:41 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I could take you out in the medium transport if you wish he to come back."

21:41 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Or, if they're not known for interdicting, I could just run to other sectors and wait them out?"

21:41 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "It has a little more firepower."

21:41 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Though admittedly, not much."

21:41 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a watchtower out there. Up to you if you wanna mess with it. IFS don't interdict but have long-range lasers. Kelsey often interdicts."

21:43 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I have around 120 industry points, I want to rectify that."

22:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Vengeance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:00 The ship is already moving.

22:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:00 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

22:00 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:02 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: -o(qW.X'Rzv}yKnEjcSrL.A!O{B+7Y",9^;b,/cu
