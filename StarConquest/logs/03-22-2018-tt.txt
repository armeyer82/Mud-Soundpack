surveying unit, a temporary structure launcher, a bottle of fine white wine, a
large beanbag chair, a floor lamp, Higgins the droid, Daizey the droid, an
advanced FTL drive tracer, an internal stun turret, a plastic cooler, and a

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved top of lightweight deep amethyst purple cotton
with delicately painted gold flowers at the wrists and hem and a pair of skinny
white low rise jeans. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes,
neck, both wrists, both hands, waist, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a white four poster rattan bed with
a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see Meow the little calico CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously
deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly
colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold
fringe on it, KitCat the humanoid service robot, Kiska the humanoid service

[Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a dark violet
fabric armchair, a black plastic paper dispenser, a wormhole drive tracer, an

She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval, lightly-freckled, and lovely, with a button nose and dimpled chin.
Her lips are faintly upturned and rose-pink and occasionally part to reveal a
set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and
almond-shaped. Her ear-length, curly hair is auburn and in a chic and stylish
pixie cut. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
A slender silver ring engraved with a row of tiny chainguns pierces her left
earlobe and a slender silver ring engraved with a row of tiny chainguns pierces

 She is wearing a thin red knitted turtleneck, a wristwatch with a slim black
leather band, a slim silver ID bracelet with C.T. engraved on the front in a
flowing script, a pair of black low rise denim jeans, and a pair of supple black
flight boots. She is also wearing an elegant gold ring inset with a perfect
solitaire diamond, a black silk handbag embroidered with brightly hued dragons,
a silver touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, and a compact
metallic purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a
flower strap. Her head, face, both eyes, both hands, and waist are left
uncovered.

The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through
into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.
The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the

platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.

it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

asteroid cluster or a field of shipwrecks. Planets are typically systems of
themselves or associated with a star or star formation."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "...that was random."
[PA] Clarina Taylor: "I think it was a response to Blake's question."

concerning whether or not any planets were surveyed from within that last area."

The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.
A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

we're doing approaches, for the record."
A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something
hidden inside the endless webbing.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Coming back, Clari?"
A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to
a viewport.
A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through
the window before disappearing.
A single tendril of silk wafts over you, glistening with beads of moisture.
The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.
A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through
into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.
Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

[PA] Keegan Wantz: "We probably won't hit unknown space."

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startlingly like a single
unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass
is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a
glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created
here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Hey."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Sup."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
There is a momentary pause from the gunfire and then the shooting resumes.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly

The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.
An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the
fog.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left
leg is soaked in blood.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes
close slowly and it appears to sleep.
A white bird flashes by over the plain.
The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.
A white bird flashes by over the plain.
A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.
A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to
swirling mist.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "Gosh I still have to work on these holo films ugh."
Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other,
tortured bodies straining with the effort.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Hawthorn, you said two hours?"
On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls
from the sky.
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "That or so. Yeah."
[PA] Hawthorn Dunn: "I will try not to over sleep."
The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.
The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey
reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey,
before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.
The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.
The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
The monkey drops down to a lower branch.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Gonzales Bourne: "Repair time. Who's awake?"
[PA] Tony Cross: "I am awake."

oorts, asteroid clusters and even fields of shipwrecks but planets and if we do
find any star forations, those would be decent. We ave to get out of Local Space
to find anything of much value."

the better stuff."

for only other things as well. Credits do factor into it I'd think."

or other Sightseers are attached. The Control Room becomes a Weapon Room so you
can no longer see the status."

Ryan Thomas says, "Probly not."
Ryan Thomas says, "Don't see a point to it."

ship, in order to support more crew."

few. Maybe."
