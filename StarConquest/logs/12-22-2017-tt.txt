Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!
This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However,
we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make
sure everyone gets a gift!
First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within
the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and
celebration a little closer to the holiday!
Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes
for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that
already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action
figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos, custom hair styles, small "plastic
surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest
selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details
for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much,
please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to
add additional lines of text!
Thank you!
   Announced 3 days, 22 hours, 23 minutes, and 9 seconds ago

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and
an insulated red sleeping bag here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on an insulated red sleeping bag.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived
at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long
time since we drifted off course en route and it required about
another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When
melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want
to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back
in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to
prepare a written statement as well albeit I didn't ask permission
to do so but I really wasn't given the time to ask very many
questions.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda into the Control Room of the ship and the
exchange began like this. I asked? 'so Melinda do you have a
letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels says. "I do not, she is, um, unavailable."
Melinda then says, "So we are running without either voice
currently."
I nodd to Melinda.
I then asked Melinda? 'so who did she appoint to act on her
behalf?
"She did not appoint anybody," Melinda says. "I took it upon myself
to come out here and make sure you guys knew."
I then said to Melinda. 'well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here.
Melinda next said. "Since she is not available, I will probably
take it upon myself to send whatever letters are needed," Melinda
says. "Somebody has to."
I then went further to state. 'Second, I want to express that i am
very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime happens
to all citizens of all alliances.
'I am not happy with what has occurred.
Melinda then nodded in agreement.
I then said to Melinda. 'Still, I am not the Military. I am not
the aEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government
Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more.
I added with another question? 'So too, did Ather Jammoa send you
here?
"Nobody sent me," says Melinda.
I then said. 'ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who
wants me back there.
Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice," says Melinda, "troubling times are at hand and here I am."
Melinda says, "We want some kind of word, people are getting
upset."
I responded with. 'yes but if our government felt I should be
there, they have the means to dispatch that request to me. I
informed them before I left of my plans as well.
Melinda asked the following which I hoped would be a good faith
effort on her part to convey my need for clarification. "So," asks
Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?"
She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had to say
which was. 'Even if i were there, I am not the party who can
control the behavior of aEU citizens.
Melinda says, "Of course you can't."
She continued with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an
official capasity, you will remain on said trip," Melinda says. "Is
this correct?"
I concurred by saying. 'well it's very much out of my hands. They
need to understand that it's not within my power to control AEU
Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal with those
issues. You can certainly convey to them in o uncertain terms that
I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-
emphasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
Melinda says, "Okay I will do this."
Melinda says, "All right."
Melinda Michaels then stood up to leave without repeating anything
back to me as well as she didn't let me finish what I was saying.
I just went on by stating. 'If I were back there, there really
isn't anything I could do.
Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies."
She still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went
on to say. 'AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to
me as well.. "That's fine," says Melinda.
Melinda says, "I tried."
'Thank you for doing so.
Melinda waved. Then she says, o very unceremoniously, Melinda
says, "Yup."
Melinda says, "Later."
I waved back rather amazed that she seemed both not interested in
what I was trying to gather from the scant information I had as
well as nothing official from the leadership from the league nor
Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms.
Melinda Michaels then rather rudely walked out. There is certainly more that I
would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a written
statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request which
didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took time to
consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the AEU
seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann in
his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on
to Tom Town to charge overnight. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship
was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. After a rather sleepless night, when
I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very
apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of
Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of
the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very
gracious and he
said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to
Comms. Since there was no other means aboard Johann's Galleon to
communicate that we were returning, it is unfortunate that a hasty
decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf. I further find
it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurry not to allow
me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared
before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on. I apologize
to you all though as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was
in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans
of
others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather
Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have
hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.

Dear Lily and Shule,
I need some help. I am struggling how to handle my reaction to people's
judgement and criticism and gossipping. It has stressed me out so much that I am
considering retiring. I mean, these people used to be my friends, but now that
I've closed up to them because of some tramatic event that happened to me, and
because they gave me a blow and gave me reasons not to trust them anymore, they
don't take it kindly. Instead I'm being judged and criticised for what I do,
sugarcoated when I'm with them, and being very discouraged. It's not making my
life as a pilot very enjoyable. It isn't fair, and I shouldn't feel the need to
retire because of childish gossipping people who deprive you of what you want to
do. To be frank I wish to know how you guy can stand to be around and stick
through things, and these people? I mean to be honest from hanging around with
my league mates you guys aren't very liked, but I just don't see why. Or maybe I
do. Maybe it's because it's the same reason why I'm on their ganging up on side.
Because I don't like to be controled by them or suck up to their faces.. I guess
I'm just looking for some encouragement or comfort, and a reason to stay. I'm
reaching out for help. I'm Katina, shy, hard to stand up for myself, and care
too much what people think. I don't want to retire, I love being a pilot, I just
wish people would leave me alone. I want to see the kind people around here, I
don't often see them. Only the drama stirer upper people. Please help me? I'm
asking to meet up with you guys and talk, or perhaps talk through exchanging
letters if you don't have the time or want to meet up and talk about it. I've
sent you both the same letter because I didn't know who to send the letter to.
sincerely,
Katina

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a
small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Asteroid Belt Management Station.
