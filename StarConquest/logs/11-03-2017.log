03:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just have a very limited window of time though."

03:09 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Well, it'll be safe if we have to leave it there."

03:13 Lily says to you, "I see there's 12 units available on Nissi's carrier so hopefully there will be room for your Sightseer."

03:14 You nod.

03:14 You smile.

03:17 Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

03:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

03:23 Mischief the large black felo jumps down from your lap.

03:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They may be taking a fighter or two though."

03:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Evil Eye". The organization has earned 612,300.55 credits.

03:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm jsut glad it's not Asteria who is over there though. She wouldn't survive."

03:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I guess she would survive a week and maybe a day after."

03:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But that day after would be very critical as she would need to be fed."

03:29 You nod.

03:30 You say, "Me too. She definitely wouldn't."

03:43 Mischief the large black felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

03:47 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

03:47 You glance at your communicator's screen.

03:47 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I sense there's a bit of friendly competition afoot between Jade and Katie! Go you both for successfully completing your Low Deployment Missions. I look forward to seeing you both become even more awesome! In your Ground Combat skills. [02:47  3 November 2317 GST]

03:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, Purr th
03:47 e humanoid service robot, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

03:49 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

03:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "You're not going to check your office?"

03:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:49 You say, "I did earlier today."

03:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Ah ok then are you ok to go on over to the Torus?"

03:50 You nod and smile.

03:50 You say, "Whenever you are."

03:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Ok too I forgot to add pay rent. I did pay mine earlier today but we'll likely be back before the end of the month so you won't be evicted!"

03:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:50 You say, "I already paid rent too."

03:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

03:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:51 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

03:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:51 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:51 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:52 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:52 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

03:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

03:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:52 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So hmm I see Eli if Constantine shows up, we'll do the Cleansing thing."

03:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:53 You grin.

04:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They remind me of myself as I would do as many low Deployment Missions as I could plus as many Space Vermin Missions or other missions I could fit in."

04:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I never got to do the SVP missions, but cranking out all my low-deploys was like the first thing I'd do every conquest."

04:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I always did my SVP missions. I didn't do very well at doing low priority deployments back then."

04:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, me too! And then I'd go to tesla and went back and forth between tesla and SVP as I could get the tech at SVP to bring my suit back to SVP so it was awesome!"

04:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Only rats hide in ducts..."

04:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Yeah It's Johann's gig so yeah."

04:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

04:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Interesting that Johann asked us to go along in his transport."

04:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He would have to take skipper along because if he doesn't have a sitter r ofhim, he won't survive on his own."

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a 
13:47 letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps
13:47  and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on  2 October 2317 GST. Time remaining: 9 days, 11 hours, 15 minutes, and 6 seconds

14:22 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

14:22 Even though this starship garage smells like machine oil and heavy lubricants, it is spacious and well-lit. Massive hydraulic systems raise and lower starships to and from the landing pad above, and technicians and mechanics in silvery gray coveralls ensure that everything keeps running smoothly. A well-lit stairway which leads to the pilot's lounge is here.
You can go up.

14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Later maybe. I just got into this mission and don't have a lot of time."

14:24 Cadet Katie Celayla says, "Where you want me."

14:24 You say, "Gun and repair."

14:24 You grin.

14:24 Cadet Katie Celayla sashays up.

14:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Bonzai Trout, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

14:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:25 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

15:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:17 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

19:17 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station in The Belt of Orion.

19:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, on my way but I still need to switch suits."

19:17 The computer reports that the three-person cannoneer "EAOS Ion Rider Delta" has jumped out of the sector.

19:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:17 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:18 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:18 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

19:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:18 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

19:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:18 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:24 Constantine Stone uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:24 Kim Saunders strides south.

19:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Lion's Den, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

19:25 Cadet Katie Celayla speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

19:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Makes a change."

19:25 You feel a slight bump as the aerial fortress detaches from "Lion's Den."

19:25 You hold yourself steady against the sudden thrust as the aerial fortress fires its descent thrusters.

19:26 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a League Templar from storage and sets it in front of you.

19:26 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

19:26 You press a button on a League Templar, which splits open down the front. You carefully climb inside.

19:26 Cadet Katie Celayla presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves an AEU Light Combatant from storage and sets it in front of her.

19:26 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

19:26 A faint vibration soon turns into a steady rumbling as the aerial fortress thrusts toward the space station.

19:26 Cadet Katie Celayla presses a button on an AEU Light Combatant, which splits open down the front. She carefully climbs inside.

19:26 Cadet Katie Celayla speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

19:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Lem know when we're launching."

19:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hopefully the sector isn't invaded."

19:26 The rumble of thrust eases off as the aerial fortress achieves a hovering position near the space station's docking bay.

19:26 You can't do that right now.

19:26 You say, "Soon."

19:26 You hear a faint hum as the aerial fortress engages its cloaking device.

19:26 Kim Saunders says into the PA microphone, "Do not forget to hide the mule?"

19:26 You say, "Soon."

19:26 The aerial fortress isn't currently over a mission area.

19:26 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

19:26 (20 seconds roundtime.)

19:26 Wait 15 seconds.

19:27 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

19:27 (20 seconds roundtime.)

19:27 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

19:27 [Ventilation Tunnels; Entry Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a battlesuit, and the presence of the heavy powered armor appears to be distending the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with giant bugs and mold!
You can go north.

19:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't have much focus to help, but I'll try to keep an ear out for anything trying ot attack you guys from this side."

19:27 You peer north...

19:27 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go south and west.

19:27 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant).

19:28 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

19:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome, thanks."
A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Constantine Stone (EAOS Alchemist).

19:28 Constantine Stone says, "One sec."

19:28 You nod.

19:28 Cadet Katie Celayla waggles her new fancy smancy gun.

19:28 You say, "Now my apologies as this is the first time I have lead here in the vents."

19:28 Cadet Katie Celayla smirks.

19:28 You grin at Cadet Katie Celayla.

19:28 Kim Saunders smiles at you.

19:28 Cadet Katie Celayla asks, "Just apologising in advance?"

19:28 Kim Saunders says, "You can't do worse than me."

19:28 Kim Saunders says into her red metachannel FTL communicator, "Bats?"

19:28 Constantine Stone says, "Okay."

19:29 Cadet Katie Celayla says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Bats and rats and cats in hats."

19:29 You say to Kim Saunders, "Don't challenge me. I just might."

19:29 Kim Saunders says into her red metachannel FTL communicator, "Where?"

19:29 Constantine Stone says, "Good thing my eaos suit has pulse."

19:29 You grin.

The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

20:03 [Ventilation Tunnels; T-Junction] (inside a battlesuit)

20:03 Here, a straight tunnel branches into two alternatives. One can go that way, or one can go that other way. The possibilities are endless!
You see the corpse of Bari Vine Cluster Alpha, Constantine Stone (EAOS Alchemist), Kim Saunders (EAOS Alchemist), and Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant) here.
You can go north, east, and west.

20:03 You peer north...

20:03 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Hallway] (inside a battlesuit)
The rectangular ventilation shaft continues further in the same direction. It's amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins -- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You see Bari Worker Horde Alpha here.
You can go east and south.

20:03 You peer east...

20:03 
[Ventilation Tunnels; Dead End] (inside a battlesuit)
A large mound of mold has collected in this dead end of the ventilation system. In general, if there could ever be any reason to want to visit a dead end, being greeted with a pile of mold probably eliminates it.
You see Bari Worker Horde Alpha here.
You can go west.

20:08 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, that's what I usually do too. But I like not having to switch ships as well."

20:08 Constantine Stone says, "To run off pirates and IFS."

20:26 Wait 1 second.

20:26 Constantine Stone lights his battlesuit's ascent rockets and begins speeding upwards.

20:26 You light your battlesuit's ascent rockets and begin speeding toward the waiting aerial fortress.

20:26 (20 seconds roundtime.)

20:27 [Aerial Fortress "Nemean Lion"; Deployment] (inside a battlesuit)

20:27 The aerial fortress appears to be at Old Frontier Processor.
You see Constantine Stone (EAOS Alchemist) here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
You rocket through the fortress's entrance hatch and stumble to a stop on the deck.

20:27 Illuminate wears off.

20:27 An EAOS Alchemist suddenly splits down the front and deposits Constantine Stone.

20:27 Kim Saunders abruptly rockets in through the entrance hatch, having returned from the surface, and stumbles to a stop on the deck.

20:27 You say, "Wait to call the mule."

20:27 Constantine Stone says, "Okay."

Constantine Stone and Kim Saunders are standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.
A crane descends from the ceiling and efficiently returns all battlesuits in the area to storage.

20:27 Consider it done! (Since there are no battlesuits here anyway.)

20:27 Kim Saunders says, "I am actually really excited about going on this trip."

20:28 You grin.

20:28 You exclaim, "It should be fun!"

20:28 Kim Saunders asks, "I should consider early nominating myself for the whip position, I don't think anyone is ready to take it?"

20:28 You nod to Kim Saunders. "You should."

20:28 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah you should, if you can."

20:28 Kim Saunders says, "I really don't want back in the voice office though."

20:28 Constantine Stone says, "Dakhal hasn't really been around in a long time."

20:28 You say, "Neither do I."

20:29 You say, "I'd be happy if I never saw that office again."

20:29 Kim Saunders says, "I consider myself to be thoroughly unsuitable to that task."

20:29 You say, "Ditto."

20:29 A quiet beep serves to notify you that the aerial fortress has completed repairs of all stored equipment.

20:30 Kim Saunders says, "I think I am lucky I got out when I could, Ather might be stuck with it for a while."

20:30 You say, "When I found out that a crazy lady was going to try to get humanity all killed, yeah, I realized I was not the right person."

20:30 Kim Saunders asks, "Unless Eli wants to give it another try?"

20:30 You say, "Maybe."

20:30 You say, "Who knows."

20:30 Kim says to you, "Well, we all didn't really see what Tatiana's second plan was."

20:31 Constantine Stone says, "I would do it again."

20:31 Constantine Stone says, "But last time I did it wrecked half the city."

20:31 You nod to Kim Saunders.

20:31 Constantine Stone says, "I, rather."

20:31 Kim says to Constantine, "So you were the only one who crash landed a ship? Someone told me Eli did it too, in fact I was referred to ask Eli why it happened."

20:32 Constantine Stone says, "We both did."

20:32 You say to Kim, "I think Ather was planning on being voice for a couple of terms."

20:32 Kim Saunders says, "A stupid idea if you ask me, to crash land a ship."

20:32 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah."

20:32 Constantine Stone says, "It was pretty dumb."

20:32 Kim Saunders asks, "So, what prompted you to do it?"

20:32 Constantine Stone says, "I don't know."

20:32 Cadet Katie Celayla flicks on a portable newsfeed aggregator and peers intently at the screen.

20:32 Constantine Stone says, "I think we just felt like we were running out of time and had no options."

20:32 You say, "Desperation I think."

20:33 Constantine Stone sighs.

20:33 Kim Saunders says, "Yeah, well, I can relate to desperation. I felt pretty much desperate as well."

20:33 Constantine Stone says, "I wish we had just blown them up in space."

20:33 Constantine Stone says, "Like we had been doing."

20:33 Constantine Stone says, "I don't know why we didn't."

20:33 Kim Saunders says, "So, eli and Ather got unrogued, which is a surprise in itself."

20:35 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I don't really know what to make of that. I think they were just pleased that the strike was over."

20:35 Kim Saunders says, OOCly, "Guys, I need to do something, this took longer than expected."

20:35 You say, OOCly, "Ok. We can put you in the lounge when we get up there."

20:35 Constantine Stone says, OOCly, "No worries, we're good from here. We'll put you in the lounge."

20:35 Constantine Stone walks north.

Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

20:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:44 You scramble to your feet.

20:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:44 The ship is already moving.

20:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

20:44 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:45 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How far do you suppose Feng Wo is from this artifact field?"

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I hear it's about a day's travel."

21:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking about bringing a small consignment of alcohol with me in my hold."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And maybe popping over there to trade and hang out for a bit."

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think that would be too dangerous?"

21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I will likely make a quick jaunt over there just to see it at some point, if the other's don't have a problem with us being seperated."

21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm wish I'd thought of that."

21:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What would I need, probably sensor rigging and definitely the comm safety override?"

21:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably, I'm not even sure you would need the rigging as it's a known station you'll be picking up."

21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It certainly cant' hurt though, I'd hate to tell you not to get it it and then you need it."

21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, that would really save me some scratch if I didn't need that."

21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

21:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It might be nice to have, just so I can identify landmarks along the way and such."

21:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm being told that you might need a ship designated as a trade ship. But if you are just gonna put it on the palett, I'm not sure it will matter. Just be careful."

21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting."

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it can't carry much. I suppose a runabout would have been better in that regard, too."

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though I wouldn't be able to reach out a day in a runabout."

21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This will be a fun side adventure!"

21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'd just like to go see it, maybe take a couple of pictures."

21:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

You can go north and down.

21:47 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

21:47 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:47 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

21:47 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:47 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:47 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

21:47 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:47 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

21:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:48 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:48 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:48 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:48 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:50 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

22:50 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Kim Saunders followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:50 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:50 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
Kim Saunders followed you.

22:50 You disband your group.

22:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:50 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 995" has jumped out of the sector.

22:50 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:50 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

22:50 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:50 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:50 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:50 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

22:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:50 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:50 That is already rolled up.

22:50 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

22:50 Kim Saunders strides east.

22:50 You pick up an insulated purple sleeping bag.

22:51 You put an insulated purple sleeping bag in a leather briefcase.

22:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:51 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Heh, it's a bit of a mess in here."

22:51 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:51 Via general sector communication, AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There are currently no active decoy beacons in surrounding sectors."

22:51 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You do not wanna see the control room of White Eagle."

22:51 You laugh into the PA microphone.

22:51 The starship transitions into another sector.

22:52 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:52 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

23:38 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

23:39 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:39 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Starlight Express, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:39 The ship is already moving.

23:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Capital Ship Drydock. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:39 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

23:39 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:39 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:39 The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and darkened, and the ISC is no more.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:39 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Capital Ship Drydock."

23:39 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:39 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)
The computer reports that the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-71" has jumped out of the sector.

There does not seem to be much visible damage to the girders, beams and plating that you can see, but the rest of the assembly is just no longer there. The damage to the deck has bent into a rather unnatural ramp leading downward to the underside of the aft frame assembly. There is also a large hole in the station's skin here.
