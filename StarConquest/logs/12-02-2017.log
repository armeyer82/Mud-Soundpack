A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

02:30 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:30 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:30 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:30 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 382" has landed on the planet New Earth.

02:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:30 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:30 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:31 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

02:36 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

02:36 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:36 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

02:36 You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

02:36 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:37 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I hadn't even planned on actually engaging any ships up close. I was just going to shoot bolts from a distance."

02:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Capital Ship Drydock. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

02:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:37 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:37 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Shipyards."

02:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38 The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and darkened, and the ISC is no more.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:38 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Capital Ship Drydock."

02:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:38 A large frame hangs in space here, sufficiently large to at least contain a battlecruiser-class starship.

02:38 Via general sector communication, Shipyard Structure transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Kalina.' Welcome to Capital Ship Drydock."

02:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But I barely got there in time to even activate sensor dampener before the fight was over."

02:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok well I wouldn't fault you for saying no if it was your ship. I would just accept your preference."

02:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:39 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:39 The computer receives no response, and begins docking procedures.

02:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I didn't have time to argue or debate it."

02:39 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

02:39 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:39 I don't understand that.

02:39 I don't understand that.

02:39 You may not leave the ship until the airlock's environment matches the external environment.

02:39 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

02:39 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:39 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

02:39 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:39 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

02:39 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

02:39 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

02:39 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

02:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's not an argument. Still if I asked you for same, I would respect your preference."

02:40 You exit the ship.

02:40 [Shipyard Structure; Docking Bay]

02:51 You peer out...

02:51 
[Capella Station; Docking Bay]
Every surface in this large docking bay has been coated with an oily residue, disturbed in places where starships have landed. Beneath the residue, the metal and plasteel is blistered, as though by extreme heat. At the edges of the bay are various shapeless blobs of melted plastic, but all the metal has been removed.
The four-person light carrier "Kalina" is landed here.
You can go north.
You are weightless here.

02:51 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

02:51 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

02:51 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

02:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

03:26 Like the docking bay to the south, this ITPN station appears to be wholly open to space, an illusion enabled by the use of a huge single piece of curved transparent plasteel. A metal viewing rail runs around the exterior of the semicircular space. At its center, the pod platform is positioned directly below a broad hole in the ceiling that leads up into open space. Pods arrive and depart through the hole with clockwork precision. Passengers disembark and load from a designated area at the top of some stone steps. Large displays hang from the ceiling and provide status updates.

03:27 Lily,
I thought we just had a long, intimate conversation last night about how much we loved each other. If you really want to throw that away, then I won't stop you. I'm sorry if you thought my actions were out of line, but I was simply done sitting on the sidelines watching our navy get picked apart. I didn't have time to discuss it. It/s up to you.
Shule

03:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I will be sad forever but I suppose you want your wild escapades moreso."

03:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I can't stop you and I won't. If you want to walk away from what we had."

03:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "What do wehave when you behave as you did when I simply said I didn't prefer that you tossed an asset of ours into the fray?"

03:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I thought you trusted me more than that to have a good reason and a strategy."

03:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Last morning I sensed you would prefer threesomes and other things over me in the first place."

03:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's not fair. I told you I was open to the idea, not that I preferred them."

03:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I won't kick you out just now but you will have to come to me first and I know you won't because the wild side is calling you my love."

03:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And you know what? I've played the wild side, I've been hurt from the wild side. I wanted you because I knew you'd beloyal or at least I thought so."

03:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I am not convinced."

03:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sadly I am not convinced."

03:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Then if my faithfulness is not proof enough for you, then nothing ever will be."

03:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well heh faithfulness but launch."

03:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And I didn't run out of the ship because I was angry. I ran out of the ship to check the terminal because things were happening really fast."

03:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Faithfulness but no respect for one's preferences is included I see so that is the trade off."

03:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire sighs. "This is exactly why.... Never mind. It's fruitless. If you feel you must walk away and if it will make you happy, then I won't stop you."

03:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup I knew when I made it this easy you'd be eager to go anyway."

03:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If I was eager to go, I'd have already left the org.?Obviously, I'm not."

03:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh so if we jumped in with that little ship and got blown to bits in a couple of hits how would that help our navy don't blame me for being responsible."

03:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Why is it that I feel every few months, you want to test the waters so that you can find an easy out of our relationship? So now you have your out Shule."

03:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "The Merry band ships had their hands full with the navy ast it was. I just wanted to provide support. They didn't even try to engage me."

03:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So why something as helpless as a nearly cadelt-level bolt thrower?"

03:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "For gotds sakes you could have just gone in with a fighter."

03:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Because I could at least launch bolts and make it easier for the navy to fight them."

03:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No, a fighter can't launch bolts."

03:41 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Anyone heard when the alko holics are to be home?"

03:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well well I'm not convinced but now that you have your own, I am fine to test thattheory but I jsut believed that to be irresponsible."

03:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "The water that is."

03:41 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Sorry it should be alkohaulics I suppose."

03:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I know what kind of problems bolts can cause. I've had to fly against it before, but in the end, it didn't matter this time."

03:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But it's fine. I'll just use my own next time. I have no problem with that."

03:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "The bolt thrower can only take 202 hit so as I say I'm not over-confident I'm sorry if I have sentamental regard for Flash. I'd rather see a stronger ship go in. Even our clipper or the escort."

03:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I understand that and I'm sorry. I didn't realize there was sentimental value there. I was only thinking that if our clipper or escorts got popped, we'd lose more than just the basic upgrades. Mine has a lot of crafted items on it and with our lack of access to GMG, I didn't want to take that chance."

03:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well our clipper I don't think has anyhting from Farport on it."

03:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh, I wasn't sure. I know mine does."

03:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I thought that the org clipper may have active long-range scan."

03:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Albatross has no Farport upgrades so feel free to take it into sticky situations."

03:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, I wasn't sure. I'll keep that in mind for next time."

03:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If there is a next time."

03:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well that is up to you as I certainly know you aren't committed to this relationship and never were."

03:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok...? I've stayed faithful to you throughout our relationship. I don't know how I can show you committment more than that."

03:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "But ever so often you do things like this as a gesture to pressure me to give up and i've about run the course."

03:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm sorry we even had that conversation yesteray. Obviously, I didn't do a good job communicating my thoughts."

03:57 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:57 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:57 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:57 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:57 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

03:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:57 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:57 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:57 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:57 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:58 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I specifically mentioned the ship I wanted to take so you could meet me in it if you wanted to. I wanted to check the terminal one more time. When I didn't see you in the ship, I figured you were mad at me and didn't want to come along."

03:58 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:58 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

I just didn't feel confidence in the Bolt Thrower itself. It would have been fun with us both being able to shoot but that's just not enough lasers in my humble opinion."

04:21 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:21 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:21 You say to Lily, "I love you. I want you to be happy. That's all!"

04:22 Lily says to you, "Well I want you to be happy too but sometimes I don't ehink you are."

04:22 Lily Kaise says, "I don't think you are."

04:22 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

04:23 You say to Lily, "I am. I honestly am. I just worry you're not sometimes!"

04:23 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:23 Lily Kaise says, "No no it's not you love. It's just all of the bad stuff all around."

04:24 Lily Kaise says, "All of that evil senseless crap."

04:24 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I understand."

04:25 Lily Kaise says, "Makes me just want to go back to keeping books which is like death warmed over for me as in this era, ther' not much of a future for a financial person unless they are politically anointed."

04:25 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:27 You say to Lily, "And I'm sorry about yesterday's conversation. I want to make sure you're satisfied. If you are, then that's all that matters to me and I'm more than satisfied."

04:28 Lily Kaise says, "It's such a heavy weight. I try to do the right thing. I try to do good things for others. I am truly dedicated to helping others grow and to excel and when somebody like Ather who is eaten up with jealousy and bitterness has so much influence over others like what he did to sEAS simply because I felt it was just as importnt to serve my responsibility to renewing the beacon out in 777. I had intended to come back if I could but I only had a little time that morning."

04:28 Lily Kaise says, "Then Melinda who lied and absolutely lied about me."

04:28 "I know." You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close. "People didn't understand that and refuse to understand that."

04:29 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:29 You say, "Ather just wanted something to throw at you and he got it. He would have found something eventually."

04:29 Lily Kaise says, "We tried to get her to stay a little longer."

04:29 Lily Kaise says, "Well he already did as he got me demoted."

04:30 You nod. "But like you said, he has a personal vendeta against you or something."

04:31 Lily Kaise says, "I was just trying to understand why nobody from my own alliance wasn't right there telling Melinda or others that I should come back. Still, I wanted to discuss it moreso because just hearing something third hand like that is hard to grasp onto. Still, if I were in the same position again, I'd jsut go back and you know, had we been in my ship or yours, we would have."

04:31 You say, "I have no idea what he thinks of me and honestly, n neither do I care."

04:31 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I know we would have."

04:32 Lily Kaise says, "Well ather probalby doesn't see you as a threat to him. I don't know why I would be but he just has gone out of his way to exploit what he could."

04:33 "Yeah, I don't know why either." You shrug. "Probably because he could never get close to you?"

04:33 Lily Kaise says, "Naa doubt that."

04:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:33 You say, "Then I have no idea."

04:33 Lily Kaise says, "It's because I'm a very hard worker and I've achieved a lot of wealth and you know if it were you and not me, I'd be proud of you."

04:34 "I know you would be and I'm proud of you!" You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:35 Lily Kaise says, "I won't tell anyone else because I don't want to gloat or brag about it but I did manage to get ahead of Ather in exploriton. I'm sure that is just killing him."

04:35 Lily Kaise says, "Explortion."

04:35 You cheer for Lily Kaise!

04:35 Lily Kaise says, "Wow I can't talk this morning."

04:35 You say, "I know what you meant."

04:38 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:38 An oversized semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.

04:43 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Until it's due or oh nos way overdue!"

04:44 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Oh 285 down again?"

04:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It appeared so when I tried to go to it earlier."

04:44 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Aa."

04:45 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Whichtr gen Wish I could help but I don't have access to the pertinent parts these days or I'd go rebuild it."

04:45 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It's all good, I was just notifying people."

04:46 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:46 [General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah Good that you pointed it out Lexie. The other crew should be back soonish I'd imagine."

04:46 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hopefully so, at least according to their original guess it should be tomorrow or sunday."

04:47 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:47 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:47 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

But with so many ships in the sector and the Merry Band ships out numbered and out gunned as they were, firepower wasn't really what I wanted. I just wanted to disable the Merry Band ships to make it easier on the navy to pick them apart. It was the very least I could do. I feel like I just totally let the navy down."

06:04 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

06:04 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:54 You can go east, southeast, and out.

13:54 [Starship "Thunder And Lightning"; Control Room]

13:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Remaining weight capacity:              = 37700


13:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:55 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:56 I don't understand that.

13:56 I don't understand that.

13:56 [Starship "Albatross"; Control Room]

13:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

14:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:01 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:01 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

14:01 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:01 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

14:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:01 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

14:01 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Albatross! Welcome to home space!"

14:01 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

14:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Albatross. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:01 The starship is already moving.

14:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:02 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:02 You pull a large lever towards you.

14:02 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:02 You scramble to your feet.

14:02 [Starship "Albatross"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

14:02 You exit the ship.

14:02 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Albatross" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

14:02 Your ship 'Albatross' has been automatically moved into a garage.

14:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

14:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a gloss

Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.

23:56 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

23:56  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers.

You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

23:56 You are carrying nothing.

23:56 You kiss Lily Kaise.
