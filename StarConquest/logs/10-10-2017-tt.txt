Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

October 9, 2317. Approximately around, 10:09 GST. At 65%, from earthgate, and 
90%, from Torus, on a bearing east and slightly up from Beacon 288. We were on a
course heading towards Beacon 288, after a long voyage exploring some unexplored

space. At least, by myself and many of the other crew. a sight was seen only by
myself, Johnathon Triggs. Many others were present, and had not seen it at all.
The individuals who were awake and present at the time were Morris Corlew,
Jonathan Grays, Wendy, and Melinda Michaels. When we dicussed it, everyone else
claimed to not have seen anything. I, myself, first thought it was part of the
riftscape, till it spoke. It said, "Erto, uberdiosk." to whatever that may mean,
remains a mystery to me. The being sat crossed-legged on a turf of grass, that
was apart of the current riftscape. The riftscape was that of a grassy island.
It was a grey-skinned humanoid, with two fluffy cat-like ears, on top of a
triangular head. It was otherwise hairless, aside from a small tuff of black fur
on its chin. It had large eyes, with black horizontal puplis. It stared at me,
with no expression for a moment. Then it spoke those words.. I offered it a
greetings. Figuring it might have been real.. not part of the actual riftscape.
I said, "Hello. Greetings." It tilted its head as it faded from view.

that? Even just somethign very minor like picking up on peole's feelings?
Something like that could be amplified by the rift perhaps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey coughs. "Peoples."
Lily says to Johnathon, "Well I ahve to call it a day. This is really
interesting information though and I've seen other messages in the rift too

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove"
You see a gunship here.
"William Dove" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "ASS-E7" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is faded and slightly scorched and painted a white color with gunmetal
grey trim. Its laser turrets are somewhat scorched and outlined in gunmetal
grey. Its landing struts are rusted and slightly uneven and painted gunmetal
grey.
It has a small shiny black circular section, a series of delicate antennae
encased in a transparisteel dome, and a smooth dome on the forward end.
It has a luxury sightseer, a luxury sightseer, and a luxury sightseer attached
to its base block.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a plastic frond of light green sea fern.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Kinda holed up in my ship
today. Just had to fly over to Hyperion to check my mail."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Get anything
good?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah I guess. It was my
imaging payment stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm collecting
some artifacts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have almost
400 in my can here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Holy cow, 400?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Gonna be a big
payday for me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, not for
me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How in the hell did you
get that many? Are those still from before the strike?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But for
somebody."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "About 100 are
from before."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can pick up
about 50 a day or more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "From the bubble?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's impressive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's
getting there. I'm not sure how much they're worth for me now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not 3."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'm hoping
more than 1."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well that many you'll get
tons of points and credits."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly
indifferent to its surroundings.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They're taking what we
owe out of what we make right? As far as I know we don't have to submit it
ourselves. Richards didn't mention it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that wasn't
my understanding."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an
orange glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't seen
anything so far to make me belive that's been happening."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wasn't sure
how we were supposed to pay it, actually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well it would make the
most sense, since we are taxed like 99%, but honestly they never said to me
anything like needing to pay it. I still plan to make repperations of my own
anyways, but yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was kind of
hoping to ask Ms. Richard if she would set up an account with a negative balance
for me on atms or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless that
would ruin my ability to buy ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I
offered to pay back the damages and she didn't really seem to care."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "She was like
well, as long as you abide by the contract, knock yourself out."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So far I've only
spent money."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea

"Mrrp.".
A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic
statue of a Jinu.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. you still gotta
eat too man. probably what we should do, is have them take a percentage out of
our earnings."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Fifty percent, or even
sixty. That way you still make some money to buy things you might need or pay
bills."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When this is
over I want to have a little something in the bank for myself."

comes next."

that translates to "welcome"."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, is that the erto?"
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It sure is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll work on the
other one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This is a bit of a silly
question, but were the Jinu known to have any sort of telepathic ability? I find
it interesting that only Johnothon could see or hear it, though others were
presen. Could still be rift weirdness but, still."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. present."
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings
itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it
withdraws.

little too hopeful abou tthings that are likely just insignificant."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The telepathic
contact likely resulted from the rift."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We've never had
reason to believe that the Jinu had any telepathic powers."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the airlock.
A large semi-transparent cylindrical creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a fuchsia glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That word is not
coming up in the translator."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I wonder if he
miswrote it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. that's certain
intrigueing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I thought it would be
human, or friend, or perhaps traveler."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe to
something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like welcome to
a location?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Whatever it is, it's
either wrongly written, or not in the translator."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm.. could be.. the
riftscape it occured in was the floating piece of land."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine's guess
could be right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Most of their
locations don't have human translations."
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a
chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a
pirate flag.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Fascinating... I'm no
expert by any means, but it didn't seem like a normal rift encounter to me from
his description. And likely couldn't have been pulled from his mind or anything
since we were the ones that had to tell him it was a Jinu."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "He just aid it was a gray
skinned humanoid with cat-like ears and what looked like maybe a beard."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. a little tuft of
fur, it just sorta sounded like a beard to me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There is no normal in
the rift. Your mistake is assuming anything in the first place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles. "Certainly can't argue with
you there."
A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself
through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling
tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light
green sea fern.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So, constantine, we're
going half and half on the damages, right? Just asking before I try to get
somethign setup to take it out of my earnings. I'd honestly like to do more than
that because I feel like it was much more my fault than yours, but I know you've
got your own weight on your shoulders and wnat to do what you can, so I thought
half sounded good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah I guess
so. I assumed it was 50 for me, but she didn't really say."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if
Ather ever got the reports. Ms. Richard said she would send them to him."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I thought you had
just said it was fifty billion in damages on total."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it may
have been. I guess I don't remember exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Honestly, I'm getting all
of that from you. She didn't mention anything about paying off the damages
directly, just that they needed the money that we bring in through working."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah, half
of the total is fine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm sure someone
can tell us what it is."
A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up
suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its
tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I hope the supplies I
delivered helped at least a little. It was good to hear that the injured would
be patched up so quickly because of Garner Care."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the south.
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo gazes at Mischief the large black felo for
a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That is good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The other pilots have
been surprisingly understanding about the whoel thing.. I thought for sure that
everyoen would hate us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But I've only met one
person so far that seems to hate at least me."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a
violet glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not to say that folks
aren't upset.. they just seem to understand that we did'nt mean the harm that we
caused."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you talking
about Tanny."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, well.. I wasn't
going to say the name but.. yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, she's
within her rights."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Certainly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still can't
believe we're not in prison."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm happy about
it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, people
have been surprisingly supportive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Us being in prison
doesn't help anyone. We can do much more for the people we hurt this way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I expected a
brutal, lonely push to 50 billion and quiet retirement."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I don't feel
that hated."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All things
considered."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo gazes at Mischief the large black felo for
a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Obviously the
people I was working with at the crash sites would have lopped my head off if
they had known who I was."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No.. And honestly, Tanny
doesn't even really seem to hate us, she's just angry with us. She did'n tsay
that she hated me, she just said we aren't friends when I tried to ask her if
she was ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know if ti's your
thing or not man.. But I've been spending a little time in the sanctuary on the
Torus.. It helps a little."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, like in
prayer?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never tried
it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I certainly
could."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah.. I mean.. I guess
you can call it prayer. More like.. sending my wishes out to the universe and
trying to work a little on forgiving myself.. I don't nkow, maybe that's all
prayer really is anyways."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Mostly just.. being alone
with my thougs in the silence."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I feel like I'm not doing
it right.. but one of the folks said there's no such thing as doing it right.
they said just do what I feel."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think that's
probably right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think what
hurts the most is that it was all for nothing."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All of that,
wiped away, for nothing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know... I mean,
we didn't accomplish what we wanted to, but I'm not sure it was exactly for
nothing... I could be wrong but I think we made them realize that they needed to
do something besides ignoring folks and causing escalations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I kinda think that's part
of why we got the offer that we did."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've noticed we haven't
gotten anymore taungint type headlines, for example."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er. Taunting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "That could just be wishful
thinking, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope you're
right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't help but
think they saw it as an easy way to use us to end the strike."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Luckily if
that's the case, the joke is on them, since Ather had planned to end it
regardless."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Possibly, except they, 
except they clearly did'nt care about the strike at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, maybe
not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean if I were
them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would do
exactly what they did."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And it would have ended
in just a few days anyways, when Outccord went through, so why worry about it
right at the end."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Say nothing
about it to anyone until someone breaks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they were
worried it wouldn't have ended."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It makes sense, but they
could have done what they'd been doing the whoel time too. Used it to villafy
us, instead of offering us a way out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's even more
distasteful to me, that I did this fighting a government that's actually quite
nice and charitable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe that's
the case."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've certainly
done worse to the Union than they have."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I can't be sure.. But I
kinda think that Richards might have had a lot to do with our offer. I kinda
think she went to bat for us, so to speak."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe so."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Stars help me, but I
liked her. She seemed to sincerely want to help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I kind of
did too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I don't
trust my instincts anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, she coulda just
been good at handling people too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Surely that's
part of the job."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings
itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it
withdraws.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure it is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was nice to hear
though that she was against Outccord too, and that she was someone that Garner
picked. Even if she didn't come right out and say she was against it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's mostly the young
people. Folks who are more recently eligible to vote, for example."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who are against
it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Folks that like.. don't
really know any better, haven't seen the things we've seen."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No the people who are for
it are mostly theyounger folks."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "At least that's my
understanding. I was told it was people of a certain age."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It was certainly
teenagers who were out there throwing rocks at us that one night."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh really?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they seemed pretty
oung anyways."

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

translated to "Welcome, and there seemed to be no translation available for
uberdiosk. Constantine had a good theory that it might have been the name of a
place, we don't really have translations for a lot of their locations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "As in "welcoem to
Uberdiosk" We don't know for sure though, perhaps someone at the EAOS will be
able to tell us somethign from the log you sent."

anyother comments regarding it?"

a pretty close translation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "He seemed interested that
uberdiosk didn't translate to anything, that's about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where were those
person filing computers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. I find
that interesting too."

Thanks for the heads up."

communicator:

at least erto is a greeting but will be interesting if there's something about
the other word."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Will have to
waiting and find out from either Fienstein or...Griswold."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ather, you got time to
throw me a double speed plant?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I doubt they have a
translator more advanced than mine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "How sure are you that
you didn't miswrite it?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm curious if it's a place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Positively
certain. If I did mishear it.. and spelled it wrong. Is there words related to
it? That may sound similar?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Perhaps it is the name of a place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's what
constantine said earlier, I think that's probably a good guess Lily."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's the thing with
the translator. Even one letter off will kistranslate."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Although would seem odd that they would just say welcom and the name of a
particular place but I don't know much about how Jinu or anything about how Jinu
would construct a sentence or phrase."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Either that, or it's the
ultimate version of a diosk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, I am pretty
certain that I didn't mispell it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey snickers.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nah... I don't
think it was the name of a place. The grammer is off."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "You don't say,
"Welcome, to new earth." do you? You'd say, "Welcome to new earth.""
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right,  but it's an alien
language."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The Children of the Sun,
for example, communicate in images. It's truly alien."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Though.. that
said. Saying "welcome, to new earth." Would mean, "I welcome you, to new
earth..""
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
I was about to say that so alien language could be in imagry or very simplistic
language ot anything."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or
that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. I suppose
I am just thinking that it may mean more than our simple human terms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't know much
about the COTS languages. I am sure it would be interesting to learn about."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ather? What's the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

Melinda, We'd appreciate some clarifications on where SEAS will be included on
Temporary Space Stations. It's evident that Morris isn't including us on the
Asteroid processor in 285. You may recall during the meeting that we indicated
that we would include Morris's organization on anything which we build going
forward whenever we are responsible for any given station. When you phoned me,
you only indicated that we weren't included in 287, 288 and GMG. If Morris isn't
going to cooperate, we would appreciate the opportunity to resume building the
Asteroid processor in 285 or at least be provided a time frame as to when we
will be included on future stations in 285. We weren't included on the Xenology
station in Belt of Orion. Constantine needs to research a lot of artifacts and
he only wants to research those on a Xenology station where SEAS is included. He
has quite a bit to pay back for his fine. I'd rather not put up our own although
we can obtain a Xenology Scanner. Therefore, please provide a time frame as to
when SEAS will be included again on the Xenology station in Belt of Orion. If
we're not going to be included, then we will begin building our own going
forward. Last, regarding the BAS West of New Earth. The BAS West of the Torus
was down the other day and Shule and I had some time to run beacons in his
Flare. Since we didn't know when we would be included on the next BAS, we built
the one West of New Earth. We ran 4 beacons. However, we have run all subsequent
beacons via the BAS West of the Torus and I specifically informed SEAS members
not to use the BAS West of New Earth that it was only put up to fill the gap
between the BAS West of the Torus being unavailable and it's subsequent
deployment. Provided we are included on future BAS stations in the future, we
have no plans to redeploy nor have we encouraged anyone to utilize SEAS. Thank
you. - Lily

wrong."

[Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Anyone up for beacons?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah ha, 400
artifacts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nice."
A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What device was
it that can detect artifacts?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you can just
check the starmap or rundown each time you enter a sector to detect them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's also a
separate device that automatically stops your movement when it detects them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is what
you really want, but another pilot has to make it for you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Evenia sold me
mine for cheap, so I would ask her for one when you're ready."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say 30
million."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right. And I've
been doing just that, is just check the rundowns."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's also an
anomaly detector that you can use to detect the probes and such SVP sends you to
find."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Lots of manual
work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That works the
same way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But you can just
buy that at SVP."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Wonder if it
would pick up artifacts.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, it doesn't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unfortunately."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That is
unfortunate."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can't really
collect artifacts until you have the reactionless jet anyway, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I tested with
another cadet some time ago. He wasn't able to use a jet I lent him."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What a pain..."
[Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could do some beacons,
but I'm returning from the bubble."
[Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I estimate a'out 0.0D5
time until I arrive."
[Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I could join you."
[Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Chetumal, when you can,
please."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You should come
with us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Meh.. I could use
the credits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I
forgot about the point cap. Well, credits and practice are always nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Points accumulated
after reaching your point cap will slowly trickle to you when you reach full
pilot status. So, no points are really going to waste."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Good to know!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've done about
500 courier jobs over my 5 months and I've got a light transport they've issued
me. I assume they'll eventually issue me a medium, but is there anything after
that, Ather?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just don't ask me how
slowly. I've never been weird enough or grindy enough to reach a point cap...
ever."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I reached my
combat cap a bunch of times as a cadet. I think it can just be pretty low when
you've just signed on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You've barely gotten
started, Constantine. There are rumors that there are a total of 11 courier ship
levels. No one I know has reached the highest one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm not grindy...
just... like to keep busy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Wow..."
[Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "One more for sycthe beacons,
please?"

beacons?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Kim, do you know
if I will still get one point for local artifacts?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or do I stop
getting any points for those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "You still get points
for them but not as much. Certainly not 1 point per artifact. Not sure on the
exact numbers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You think less
than one?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Far as I know, yes,
less than 1 point per artifact."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where are you
artifacting, Stone?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been going
out to the bubble. I was thinking once you get your jet I could just go with you
to 777 or take you out to the graveyard of the Telexan 134th or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll get fewer
points but I don't really care that much about the points."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's as funny

it's something to laugh about."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we handled
it. The nice thing about those is that there are no chains to worry about."

retreat as needed."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Just bloody
LRLs."

chains.. over LRLs."

"UNLESS..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I had a -really-
good laser-resistant hull plating."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I just
mean that the chains prevent you from leaving in an emergency."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So long as you
stick close to the edge, you can probably withdraw quickly without taking too
much damage from the lasers as you do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if nobody
wants to nest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to haul
some asteroids or do some tesla?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It would be a 2
person nest.. at the moment, I think?"

generally start showing up at beacons? Or is it completely random?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think a

our scout does?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got less than
a billion for all those artifacts. I didn't expect such diminishing returns."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Raising all that
money is going to take a lot longer than I thought."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You've gotta be kidding
me, less than a billion?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In the past I've
received a billion for about 70, so I was expecting a lot more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Wel, I believe there's an
artifact trip coming up, you should try to come along, that will get you way
more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I definitely
will."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was hoping to
have a shuttle by then so I wouldn't waste as much space in whoever's carrier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still need 44
points for one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Who's leading
that trip? And, hey eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I believe it's a joint
Libs and CAts thing."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears
up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh.."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Is that for the reguls
sightseer Constainte, or you talking about the runabout? A lot of folks just
bring a runabout with a speed plant on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking a
regular sightseer, as I don't have a way to obtain a runabout."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If there's enough room,
you might even be able to bring your void piercer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "After studying
the ships I determined that the void piercer isn't any faster than our scout,
actually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is
disappointing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Uh, it definitely is, not
by much but it is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the only real
advantage is its better battery, but I doubt I'd be artifacting for two days
straight on the trip anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, really?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah I mean it gets over
30k KMS with not plant."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh sorry, I'm not fully
awake yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I will get
one of those, then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I thought you already had
one?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I was
thinking about it for a while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Ather's book
made me think it wasn't any faster, since both the scout and the piercer have a
10% speed bonus."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or something, I
can't remember."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises
its claws at a small plastic statue of a shark and snaps them menacingly while
dancing around it.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The scout bonus
isn't listed in his book, but it does have it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Using a scout with a
double speed plant it's still pretty close, and then you have weapons in case
there's interdictors."
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I wonder if
it's worth trying it out. They're quite expensive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well I don't know, it
kind of is but kind of isn't. You can get stuck somewhere pretty easy with a
Piercer if there's interdictors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true. I
guess My use case would just be artifacting. I don't think interdictors would
ever be a problem for me at the bubble, since I could just land and use my
bastille to deal with them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assume the
trip is going to have a similar setup? A central station that will get hit by
pirates occasionally, but I wouldn't really need to worry about interdictors
while actually artifacting?"
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils
and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah that's very strange
it does only say 110% crusing speed listed at the shop, I'm not sure what's
going on with stuff like that at the moment. My scout for example is only as
fast as my combat scout, and the combat scout has no plant."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, your
exploration scout with a plant is slower than the combat scout?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, they're the exact
same speed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my scout
does 26667."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, and the
combat scout has no plant? Crazy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have a
piercer? What does that get?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they would
just stop being lame and sell us arrows."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How fast is the top speed
on your scout constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe we should
do an AEU-organized trip someday. Like not by a particular org. Just show them
the whole corps wants to explore."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Huh, yeah that's
strange."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'd be up for
that. And be glad to go on it."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its
claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's my plan,  just
waiting to see if Ather can do something about skims first, after that I'll be
putting on together."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So do you have a
piercer?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Can't wait for
the meeting on saturday."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a
meeting?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No, I used to, but I
didn't want to get stuck with interdictors anymore. I used to use it as my
primary ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ather says it's
mandatory."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mandatory?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Since I liked that it was
a compeltely peaceful ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like the strike
was mandatory."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There will be a more
official announcement to come, I believe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Apparently, it'll
be an imporatant meeting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure it's about the
skims."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I doubt
I'll be around Saturday, but hopefully it goes well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Depending on the
time. I don't know if I'll be there or not. I hope I can be... myself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If we don't get skim
access back, then I"ll either be borrowing someone elses ship for a trip, or
taking a bare bones platform. Honestly taking the latter might show them even
more that we're serious."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I
was thinking."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I told Lily I
intend to organize one in the next month or two."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And she was
urging me not to bother putting a ship together, since I won't be able to get
any upgrades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What we need to
learn to do, is rift over that way. Screw the skims.."
A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself
through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I think if
we show them we can make money using the scraps we have, maybe they'll release
more stuff to us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can't buy upgrades
that way Johnathan."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think we could
already do that if we wanted, it's just far."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And we still
couldn't buy stuff, yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can also just get
someone to carry a ship over in a carrier for you, but the techs over there
aren't suptid. They know our ships are not supposed to be over there so they
won't let you buy the upgrades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I need someone
to bring me out there so I can get a platform and the destroyer thingie."
A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around
a plastic flower with red petals.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What a huge pain
that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What other
interesting things can I do with a platform when I'm not exploring on it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can I make a
cargo ship larger than a medium transport somehow?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think you can actually,
with the United Freight shuttles."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting. Now
would that be able to carry a salvage grapple? I know the shuttles can't
individually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or would that
only be useful for trading."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I honestly don't know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll have to
experiment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure there are many
that would disagree with me, but I also think it makes a decent heavy hitter
gunship with 3 bombers onit. There's probably a slew of reasons others have
about that to say that I'm wrong."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It would then be a
gunship with 6 tops or minicannsons on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. rops, torps.. I
think I need to go back to sleep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "John and I did a
beacon a little while earlier in some kind of torpedo boat gunship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought the
ship was weirdly lightly armed."
A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It only had
three launchers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So such a
platform would at least have more weapons than that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think that torpedo boat
gets a bonus to torpedos though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I hadn't
thought of that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, I can't imagine
it would be as big of a bonus as getting hit with six minis all at once."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm.. where is a
good place to look for local artifacts?"
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many
tendrils.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Battle of Mir."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "777 and Battle
of Mir are good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you need
a reactionless jet though."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I guess it makes sense,

himself when he tried to dock."

ship I docked in, but I think you're right. If we did find ourselves over there,
the free port doctrine would still allow us to dock."

fuck off, without a blacklisting, be violating free port doctrine?"
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo suddenly jumps onto a round white rattan

crime also be a violation?"

thing that I just said."

the rationale. Like you want to close the skim off the Union navy, fine, but why
don't they want my money."

that's the issue."

tech-sharing. I think this is the relaly big issue that you all had issues with
when you went to negotiate the QSA access."

know the differences between some of the things that were being negotiated."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, and if they could
allow civilian ships through and not the navy they would be more willing to do
that. But I'm told that it doesn't work that way."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "All we had when rift
drive was first released to us for exploration, was rift drive. That's it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm just going
off what your book says. And, no.. not just for the rift drive, ather.. but that
operates along side it in exploration.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "For example, the MK
II, only comes on certain vessels like the galleon and the augmented explorer,
or the bolt. The MK III comes only on the science vessel, as far as I'm aware
of. They're pieces of exploration we can't get anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Mind you..
nothing that I'd be able to get any time in near future."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'ms ure he just means
stuff like the furance and the hypercaster, butt like I said, we didn't have
that stuff at first anyways."

any of that."

Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hell, we didn't have
platforms when rift drive came out, either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Before, we would use
cruisers to explore, or just about anything that had a day or more's worth of
charge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You new pilots are
being spoiled by knowing that there are newer, superamazing pieces of technology
out there which can make your lives easier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's all us
newer pilots will be able to use for a while, to explore on our own. I'm still
using my cargo hauler as my exploration vessel.. because of the charge it has on
it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And, everything I
do, is all done manually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Do I look forward
to some of the better ships.. and tech. yes. I do. Greatly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Mostly, because I
look forward to visiting some distant places that my hauler can't exactly take
me to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily was telling
me that a hypercaster is all but essential."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What is the
function of a hypercaster?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's for
communication, I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "How is the
hypercaster essential? It doesn't help with the NDB, or anything like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know,
none of the farport stuff seemed essential to me, even for getting yourself
unlost, or whatever."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's only really
really useful if you're intending to blab a bunch of random jibberish around to
people."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's
what I was thinking."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well no, I'm not
going to say that the farport stuff is not useful at all. Far from it, in fact."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Everything there has
its uses. Even that shitty low-powe rhigh-output pile of shit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ok... a more
serious question. Where does one get the riftdrive from?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Useful for sure,
but I was content to just build my platform without one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The torus."

rather."

book.. a few times. And still use it. But.. I can't remember where it could be
found."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know Jonathan
Gray lost one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But who can
normally buy them?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They were a prototype
design, and there are only two in the hands of civilian pilots now."

them?"

have the other."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I flew on some
weird ships earlier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Define weird."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A fringe gunship
that had 5 chains and one launcher in each room, I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What was the
bolt?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It didn't seem
that great. Maybe it doesn't require many points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The bolt is an
exploration vessel with some experimental technologies on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then we briefly
stepped into a cruiser that had only 3 chains and a launcher in weapon room 1,
which I thought was a weird setup."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The biggest piece of
experimental technology is the ability to create rift storms, which is often
more of a hindrance than a help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah... what kind
of experimental tech?"
Mischief the large black felo gazes at Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo for
a moment, then asks, "Mrrp?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah. Right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting.
Like storms to use to travel faster?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I remember Gray
was talking about that.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Like riftstorms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, if you're
-lucky- they can make storms that will help you travel faster. If you're
unlucky, as bolt storms often tend to be, you'll get a strange storm, which will
teleport you randomly around, to the point where you will probably end up
somewhere completely unintended."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... I've
heard about those on the last trip.. we were lucky not to find any."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You won't find too
many strange storms outside of the ones the bolt generates."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ok! That's a
relief."

2,682,099.74 credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And riftstorm
detectors are purchased by someone who has the blueprints to make them. So, if
you do find one, you can hopefully navigate around it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Like I said, if there
is sufficient determination, nothing can stop someone from exploring."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Fairly accurate.
I went on the last trip as a cadet.. came back with lots of pictures."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I don't even
mean piggybacking on someone else's ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Truth be told..
there's not a lot a cadet can do. We're pretty limited... But, understandablely
so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Regarding
exploring."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "On our own.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm hoping for a
response from the liaison office in the next couple of days, but even if I don't
get one, I still want a meeting on Saturday with pilots! So, make time. I will
announce the exact time via comm notice probably tomorrow. Mandatory, discussion
of our futures, etc."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cadets are honestly
not meant to explore."
Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Agreed.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cadets from -any-
alliance."

"Mrrp.".
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Too big of a
sigh, in relief."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The Mule has a
pretty serious battery."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm a bit fuzzy
on exploring in non-exploration-grade sensor ships. Is the thing with that that
I have to manually check rift locations?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or will it not
detect the locations at all without an upgrade."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The Star and
Soothsayer have decent batteries as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, I just had a tought.
Would creating a rift storm help with geting away from an Outsider patrol? As in
would Outsiders try to go around it instead of going through it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the STar used to be
decent for it, but now the sensors are terrible for exploration."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there not
really any working around the sensor issue?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I still think it
might be ok, just not as good, but I'm told that it's just a terrible idea all
together."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably better to use a
constructor or something if you are going to use a non-exploration vessel."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why a
constructor?"
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises
its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while
dancing around it.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For the obvious
reason that you can build stations and go farther?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Because you can just shit
out recharge stations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And if you have a
furance, you could also put out repair stations to repair it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. a furance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "Furnace."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I could
buy a constructor, but not a furnace."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right? Isn't
that farport?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah taht's farpiot, but
you could still just shit out reharge stations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah! I like
that idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Goddamnit, I can't talk
right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know what you
mean."
A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its
tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest
and jets off.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "With space for
28 modules, could I carry 7 recharge stations?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Top, core,
battery, and the recharge module?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or do those
require more parts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You would need a battery
as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh you said battery."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah. So just
4 parts for each station."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think so yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's pretty
good, I'd get almost 60 hours of charge out of that, if I timed the recharges
really well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus whatever
extra time the feinstein sink gets me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The mod transport
actually gets a bit more charge too, it doesn' have to be a constructor."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Plus, it has quarters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't
think about that, but it does have more charge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And it's
cheaper."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The constructor
doesn't have quarters? That's sad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is a good
place for gathering debris?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "About... grade
20."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Belt of orion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Try around dusty
reaches and spinward cluster."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I tried to get a
scoop once.. wasn't able to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs sighs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How do temporary
charge boosters work? Do they boost your remaining charge by a certain amount,
or do they just power your ship for a certain amount of time?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They give you about 20
minutes of charge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Enough to get you out of
a bind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "From what I
undestand.. they only charge after you charge them.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any
reason why you can't load your ship with hundreds to increase your range?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just prohibitive
cost?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It would just be
extremely impractical."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think the ones
you buy have to be chaerged up, but the ones you make do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. charged."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's what I
thought he was refering to. The ones that can be made..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's the range
supposed to be on an improved salvage sensor? 8 units?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They also sell them at
supply stores."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, improved
is 8."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Reason I ask,
is.. I have one installed. Flew to the center of the sector.. looked at the
rundown.. and knew many should've been in range. But, none could be detected."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I'm not
sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, my mistake..
two were just out of range."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, yeah. I
know sometimes when I'm trying to eyeball ranges I underestimate how far things
are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "FInding a lot of
only 0 grade at dusty... hmm."

is fine in belt of orion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My mistake."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would just
head out there, it's pretty good. 777 is good also."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah 777 is pretty good
for points too, since the debris is small out of the shipwrecks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll check out
777 in a minute. Still just testing out this sensor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "777 a shipwrek
area?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep, and an
artifact field."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Er.. shipwreck."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "WIll have to
remember that for future referance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To get there, go
to Mir and autotravel to 777."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not Battle of
Mir, just plain Mir."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's even one of ours, in
theory. The area belongs to everyone now, of course. But i9t's the remains of
one of our naval forces I believe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I know mir well..
too well.. there's really nothing around there.. at all."

out.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or something
like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yep. Sensors work
well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So what does the
imager do? Is that what gets you money and points on expeditions?"
A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly
flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then
it withdraws.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess there's
also probes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It just takes initial
pictures of special interest sites."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And those pay
decently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, it images an are of
space and takes some basic sensor readings. Once you have one you can then
upgrade it with the spectroscopy upgrades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can also like, fly up
close to certain things and get photos of them. Like I took one of Hyperion and
had it posterized for example. But the primary purpose is for exploration, yes."
A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels
itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The imager is
made, right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And takes 6 or 7
lenses, apparently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Only a handful of folks
can craft them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do those only
come from IFS debris, or is there a RATS scrap piece that you can derive them
from."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The sensory apparatus
from RATS has them too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Need to do more
nests..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You could also try buying
them from people. Though you are likely to be charged part of your soul, if not
all of it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was told
once... 120 mil per lense.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Uh.. really? that sounds
awfully cheap."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not for me, it
isn't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well no, but I just mean
in general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Ather, how much would
you charge for a lense."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the airlock.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is that 5 mil,
both ways? Or, just one way?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just to go out."

free."

nothing comical about it. I've already started making vague plans in my head
