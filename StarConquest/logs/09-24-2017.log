01:56:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:56:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

01:56:26 You stroke a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

01:57:13 You say to Lily, "Mmmm, I love seeing you topless."

01:57:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

01:57:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

01:58:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pair of navy blue jeans. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with 
01:58:11 a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a star print mandolin case. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

01:58:21 Remove what?

01:58:26 You reach for Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and tug insistently at a pair of navy blue jeans, indicating that you want to remove it from her.

01:58:31 You tug Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's pair of navy blue jeans off over her legs.

01:58:40 You put a pair of navy blue jeans on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:59:38 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:59:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:00:35 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the smooth skin above her breasts.

02:00:36 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

02:00:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you softly on the neck.

02:00:54 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

02:01:01 Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

02:01:04 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.

02:01:09 Shule kisses your neck and chest as he gently caresses your back.

02:01:41 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.

02:01:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pats Purr the humanoid service robot lightly.

02:01:52 You grin.

02:01:53 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

02:02:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Good job that little robot is doing!"

02:02:11 You say, "Yep."

02:02:14 You smile.

02:02:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:02:27 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:03:42 "You are so sexy." You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I'm surprised that more guys don't try to touch you at the NQ parties. I know if I were any other guy, I'd sure love to touch you."

02:04:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I haven't been to an nQ Party in hmm coming up on 2 years now. Have no idea but most guys didn't grop other women there."

02:04:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Grope that is."

02:04:53 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:05:51 You nod. "I know."

02:05:55 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:06:16 You say, "I'm just saying, you are so sexy."

02:06:53 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:06:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's mostly a tease to pierre to get him to toss beads your way so yeah one might do some crazy moves but only towards the end of the last one did I see anyone being more explicit and it was a woman on woman thing and so I said it was time for me to call it a day."

02:07:39 I don't understand that.

02:07:57 You say, "Yeah, I know. I'm just saying that you are super sexy."

02:08:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blushes.

02:08:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well then go to Capy Myers and have your fill haha."

02:08:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Cape Myers."

02:08:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:08:42 You say, "Nah,m I'm not going to lose you."

02:08:53 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

02:09:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Im just saying there's other women from there who look similar so I just feel like onw of the same from there."

02:09:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:09:38 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Nah, you'll always be the most attrative to me."

02:09:46 You say, "Attractive."

02:09:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:10:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well thank you!"

02:10:05 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:10:28 You say, "Although, I think most guys won't touch you because they figure you'd kill them if they did."

02:10:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I even look similar to other pilots. Believe it or not, Nicolette and I have similar features."

02:10:47 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

02:11:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow you know i'm not violent. I'd just ask them not to."

02:11:20 You chuckle. "I meant that figuratively. Not literally."

02:11:23 You laugh.

02:11:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well too I really don't think many guys would at the moment because of all of my bad press heh."

02:11:59 You say, "Heh."

02:12:05 You say, "You'd be surprised."

02:12:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps."

02:12:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But not lately."

02:12:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Still, I'm not looking so."

02:12:27 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:12:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:12:47 You say, "Neither am I. I'd never date anyone else but you."

02:12:53 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

02:13:21 Lily says to you, "Well you know I won't as I wasn't intending to date anybody while in a career as a pilot."

02:13:28 You nod and smile.

02:13:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:13:49 You stroke a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

02:13:53 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:14:01 You say to Lily, "Well, you know that you are my dream woman. So..."

02:14:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Aww I sure don't see how!"

02:14:37 You say, "Hmmm, let me count the ways... Oh wait, I'd lose count before I even got half way."

02:14:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at you thoughtfully.

02:14:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What."

02:14:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:14:58 You laugh.

02:15:23 You say, "You're my tream woman in so many ways that I could never count them."

02:16:06 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:16:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:16:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:16:21 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:16:53 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:16:56 You say to Lily, "You're beautiful, smart... and I could go on and on. You're fun to be with... So on."

02:17:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blushes.

02:17:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah but I'm not always the most upbeat either. You've seen me at some pretty low pspots."

02:17:53 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps into Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap and settles in, purring.

02:17:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident hugs Prissy the big violet long-haired felo.

02:18:02 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

02:18:23 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "We all have our moments."

02:18:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Trye that."

02:18:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "True that."

02:18:43 You say, "You've seen me really down and discouraged too."

02:18:53 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:19:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll try to get ust to 5 LTC before we turn around. Had we not jumped through hoops earlier, we coul d have gone out farther."

02:19:35 You say, "And you were there for me."

02:19:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

02:19:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

02:19:47 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

02:19:57 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

02:19:58 Lily says to you, "Well you know I will always be here for you."

02:20:05 You nod and smile.

02:20:29 You say to Lily, "I'll always be here foryou too."

02:20:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll never leave your side. We may be distant for some reason but i'll always return."

02:21:27 You say to Lily, "I love you."

02:22:06 Lily says to you, "I love you too!"

02:22:33 You say, "I hope I'llnever do anything to make you want to leave me."

02:23:57 Lily says to you, "It would take a lot. If you start seeing that slut form the Fringe, well yeah but I think you'd prefer to keep your distance from her. I'm still amazed that she is so self-assured that she wouldn't think that making what is an obvious pass at you while I wasn't there is nothing."

02:24:31 You say, "Yeah, I would much rather keep my distance from her."

02:25:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Showing one's boobs to another man is not casual stuff."

02:25:42 You say, "I know. Hence why I don't like flashing unless you're there."

02:25:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah if I were there an dyou did it, you know i'd just laugh."

02:26:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:26:16 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:26:26 You say, "Same here if you did it while I am there."

02:26:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But she did it specifically to you which is disturbing."

02:26:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And I wasn't present."

02:26:40 You nod.

02:26:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "She probably knows if she did that when I was present, I would have likely slapped her."

02:27:07 You say, "Yeah, no kidding."

02:27:12 You say, "She probably does."

02:27:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yet she sure doesn't think there was anything wrong."

02:27:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So."

02:28:26 You say, "But it didn't work on me. I'm still with you."

02:29:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sorry to make it uncomfortable for you as it will likewise be for me too. However, if we do take this trip and Johann wants us to discuss things, I will not resist relating what you told me and I will say to her in front of Johann: 'now don't you not think that showing your boobs to my fiance isn't coming onto him especially if I'm not present?'"

02:29:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know she would try to talk her way out of that but there's none."

02:29:52 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:30:07 You say, "She has a reputation for lying."

02:30:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I sure won't arrange for this encounter. I'm just saying that I won't hold back."

02:30:24 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:30:25 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:30:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:30:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:30:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What the."

02:30:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:30:45 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:30:45 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

02:30:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

02:30:51 You say, "Ummm, ewird."

02:30:53 You activate the long-range scanner and search for passive detections and recent ping returns.

02:30:53 You struggle to see around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident as you work with the long range scanner controls.
(7 seconds roundtime.)

No sensor signatures detected. A PING using the active long range scanner may reveal more, but is also likely to reveal your own ship's position.

02:31:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops sorry love."

02:31:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:31:11 You laugh. "It's ok."

02:32:00 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:32:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:32:28 You lie down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:32:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.

02:32:38 Shule pulls you down on top of him.

02:32:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident lies down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:33:10 "Come lie on me?" You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:33:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:33:16 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo slides to the floor.

02:33:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slides off a pair of soft lavender silk bikini panties.

02:33:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

02:33:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a pair of soft lavender silk bikini panties in a small suitcase.

02:33:54 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:33:59 You remove all of your clothing, placing it carefully in a small suitcase.

02:34:02 You lie down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:34:34 "Come lie down on me?" You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:34:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident lies down on you.

02:34:49 You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:34:54 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:36:54 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

02:37:54 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

02:40:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:40:20 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:40:22 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:40:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:40:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.

02:40:58 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:41:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:41:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:41:20 The computer announces, "Setting course to Beacon Alpha 271."

02:41:21 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:41:31 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:41:31 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

02:41:31 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:41:32 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:41:35 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:41:41 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

02:41:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh we could have gone to 272 but that would be father I think. Let's see."

02:41:54 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:42:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button on the rift drive control board, and the starship begins dropping out of the riftflow.

02:43:27 You say, "Hmmm."

02:43:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So whi ch one?"

02:45:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:45:22 The computer announces, "Setting course to Beacon Alpha 272."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

02:45:31 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

02:45:32 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
You nod.

02:45:32 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:45:42 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

02:46:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:46:22 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

02:47:09 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Mmmm, I love touching you."

02:47:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:47:23 Lily says to you, "I love it when you touch me."

02:47:35 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

02:47:39 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:48:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sure someone has probed that one."

02:48:09 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:48:09 A readout shows Pre-Stellar Object 6250-2663 about 24.37 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southeast and Slightly Up.
A temporary beacon appears to be 19.1 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Eastsoutheast and Very Slightly Up.

02:48:14 You say, "Yeah, probably."

02:48:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We will, start out earlier sometime though and explore perhaps west of here a bit more and then south."

02:48:40 You exclaim, "Yay!"

02:48:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:49:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd love to probe and scope some more."

02:49:07 You exclaim, "That would be fun!"

02:49:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles and nods.

02:49:32 Shule kisses you as he caresses your back and waist.

02:49:54 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

02:50:39 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "If I had it my way, I'd always be touching you."

02:50:54 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:50:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:51:09 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:51:45 Shule rubs your back and waist.

02:52:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm it is tempting to travel to that pre-stellar all the same."

02:52:25 You grin.

02:52:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Naa guess not this time but we will in time."

02:52:56 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:52:59 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:53:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:53:37 Shule slips his hand between both of you to  caress your tummy and abdomen.

02:54:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gently caresses your tummy and abdomen.

02:54:56 Shule keeps caressing you as his hand slides further down.

02:56:35 Shule presses his lips to yours for a long, tender kiss.

02:57:38 Lily kisses you long and passionately in return.

02:57:52 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:59:52 Shule slides his hand further down to cup your groin and run his fingers through the hair there.

03:00:54 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:01:01 Lily begins to gently caress and stroke you.

03:02:03 Shule caresses you between you legs with one hand and rubs your back with his other hand.

03:07:15 Shule continues to caress and stimulate you between your legs.

03:10:42 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

03:10:55 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

03:11:08 Lily continues caressing and fondling you.

03:11:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

03:12:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

03:14:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

03:15:05 Shule grows hard as you touch him and he touches your intimate parts.

03:15:32 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

03:15:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

03:15:55 Lily beams at you as she notices you become firm and erect.

03:16:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

03:16:39 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:20:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

03:20:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

03:22:24 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:22:24 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

03:22:25 The computer announces, "Autoforward beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Beacon Alpha 273 in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:23:03 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:23:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I didn't want it to take us to 273."

03:23:12 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

03:23:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."

03:23:51 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:23:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Glad we started back when we did."

03:24:08 You say, "It'd be fun to do that, but probably not today."

03:24:24 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:24:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.

03:24:55 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

03:25:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well we'd go to 274 a lot faster but getting back is the challenge and not sure what the life is on these."

03:25:05 You nod.

03:25:07 You say, "Yeah."

03:25:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I guess we can sotp on 271 and check but then I'd have to put blothes on heh."

03:26:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident whispers, "I hope we didn't prolong things."

03:27:09 Shule whispers to you, "It's fine." as he places the head of his erection at your opening.

03:27:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

04:09:46 You say, "Me too."

04:10:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So let's check the power level and hopefully 270 isn't too much less in terms of power."

04:10:24 You ask, "Ok, you going to get dressed then?"

04:10:28 You grin.

04:10:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know we both prefer to get to sleep in about an hour or so."

04:11:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If there's at least ten hours of power then I won't mind us landing on 270 and then whomever wakes up first can take us in to the Torus."

04:11:57 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Works for me."

04:13:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

04:13:40 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

04:13:51 "Going to get dressed to check the power on the stations?" You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:25:45 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

04:25:55 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

04:26:04 You say, "Guh, I don't like this one."

04:26:37 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:26:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:27:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits up.

04:27:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:27:18 You begin the docking sequence.

04:27:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

04:27:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

04:27:27 I don't see "lilyon lips" here.

04:27:30 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

04:27:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:27:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up.

04:27:37 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:27:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You first heh."

04:27:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:28:17 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

04:28:17 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

04:28:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

04:28:19 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:28:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well."

04:28:31 You say, "Plenty of time left."

04:28:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "If this one is similar to 270, we're fine!"

04:28:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident lies down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:29:37 You ask, "Shall we head to 270?"

04:29:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:29:43 You say, "Up toyou. I don't mind."

04:29:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I just asked you that!"

04:29:50 You laugh.

04:29:57 You say, "I know."

04:30:07 You say, "Let's go to 270."

04:30:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok might as well go on I guess just as long as we land on the staiton and I think we would even if we happen do toze off."

04:30:36 You nod.

04:30:40 You begin the launch sequence.

04:30:45 A launch trajectory is located.

04:30:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:30:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:30:56 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

04:31:01 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 270. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

04:31:02 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:31:12 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:31:12 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:31:13 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

A temporary beacon appears to be 14.7 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic West and Very Slightly Down.
A temporary beacon appears to be 84.2 light-cycles away toward Galactic North.

05:32:36 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:32:36 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

05:32:38 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:32:39 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic North."

05:32:41 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

05:32:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:33:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

05:33:29 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:33:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:33:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:33:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:33:35 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

05:34:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:34:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

05:34:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

05:34:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

05:34:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:34:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

05:34:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:34:23 You hold Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's hand, taking her into your group.

05:34:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:39:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can certainly ask for one."

05:40:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And for the record, no more crashing ships into the landing pad, guys. That's really really really bad form. We're not trying to set out to kill or injur our own people."

05:41:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Who's crashing ships into our landing pad?"

05:41:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Doesn't really matter anymore at this point. What's done is done."

05:41:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And we're going to all have to take responsibility for it."

05:51:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "23 september, from the Liaison: There have been several patrols completed since their introduction. The object of the patrol is simple: to look for suspicious activity in order to prevent future tragedies like the bombings and murders that the people of Hyperion see on a daily basis. Would you not agree?"

05:51:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Battlesuits provide the intimidation factor. It's generally a sufficient deterrent. Don't forget, we're still coming off of a war. The Outsiders haven't even been pulled back for ten years."

05:51:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "On a daily basis? What?"

05:52:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What in the hell? There's been more than just those two murders and the one bombing?"

13:31:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:31:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:31:08 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

16:30:25 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:30:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:30:26 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:30:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:30:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:30:40 The ship is already moving.

16:30:41 The ship is already moving.

16:30:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:30:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:30:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:30:44 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:30:44 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:30:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:30:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:30:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:30:50 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:30:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:30:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:30:53 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

16:30:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:30:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:30:55 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:30:58 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

16:30:58 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

17:30:48 Constantine Stone sits down on an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a hand-made purple and dark pink dragon quilt on it.

17:31:01 You say to Constantine, "What happened exactly?"

17:31:35 Constantine Stone says, "Eli and I cut power to four ships during landing sequences."

17:32:28 You disband your group.

17:32:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So constantine please tell us, what happened?"

17:32:46 Constantine Stone says, "Well, as I said, Eli and I crashed several ships."

17:32:53 Constantine Stone says, "We were aiming for the pad."

17:33:02 Constantine puts his head in his hands.

17:33:05 Constantine Stone says, "But I guess we missed."

17:33:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident hugs Constantine Stone.

17:33:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah but you had no idea that self-destructing ships would do that."

17:33:37 Constantine Stone says, "Well, we did know they would crash."

17:33:45 Constantine Stone says, "We didn't self destruct them."

17:33:52 Constantine Stone says, "We crashed them on purpose."

17:33:59 Constantine Stone says, "We didn't know anyone would be hurt, but that's no excuse."

17:34:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps you could have chosen a sector away from New Earth like an uncharted but you didn't know."

17:34:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Right?"

17:34:20 Constantine Stone says, "Well, we didn't do this with the self-destruct sequence."

17:34:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How did you do it?"

17:34:29 Constantine Stone says, "We deliberately crashed them."

17:34:39 Constantine Stone says, "Set a landing course, then cut power about 5 seconds before landing."

17:34:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't understand."

17:35:04 You say, "I see."

17:35:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I thought there were safety features we couldn't override."

17:35:23 Constantine Stone says, "You can always cut main power."

17:35:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

17:35:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

17:35:51 You say to Constantine, "I still think you should talk to a lawyer."

17:35:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do too."

17:35:57 Constantine Stone shakes his head.

17:36:03 Constantine Stone says, "All my money is going to the victims."

17:36:12 Constantine Stone says, "Besides, I'm guilty."

17:36:19 You say to Constantine, "We have credits between us."

17:36:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Please there's a judge at least maybe he would make a recommendation or hire a public defender for you."

17:36:32 Constantine Stone says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It hasn't."

17:36:42 Constantine Stone says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "If it has, I don't know anything about it, at least."

17:37:03 Constantine Stone says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I don't think he did, it was clear to me that he had never done it before."

17:37:11 Lily says to Constantine, "Please seekout legal council."

17:37:20 Constantine Stone says, "I can't fight the charges."

17:37:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And counseling."

17:37:28 Constantine Stone says, "Whatever they're going to do with me, I deserve worse."

17:37:48 Say to whom?

17:37:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I had no idea that there was a risk of crashing into other starships too so who knew?"

17:38:13 You say, "Constatnine. I know you did it for the right reason. If we leave the acord, more than 30 people will die."

17:38:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Obviously, with power disabled guidance and such are lost but still."

17:38:20 You say, "Constantine."

17:38:23 Constantine Stone says, "I know, but these people were innocent."

17:38:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well so were you for the most part."

17:38:45 Constantine Stone says, "I've done more damage to the Union and humanity than Best ever has."

17:38:50 You say, "So, will be the vicitms if the outsiders attack and we don't have the Acord."

17:38:59 You say, "They'll be innocnet vicitums too."

17:39:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You also were influenced by Ather who won't do anything himself and has put the whole fucking burden of all of this on us."

17:39:09 Constantine Stone says, "It wasn't Ather's fault."

17:39:10 You say, "Innocnet victims."

17:39:14 Constantine Stone says, "I should have known it was dangerous."

17:39:18 Constantine Stone says, "But I didn't think about it."

17:39:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes but I mean all of this Ather isn't lifting a finger except to protest and screw me and sEAS over."

17:39:40 You say to Constantine, "Space is dangerous. O?ur universe is dangerous."

17:39:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes it is."

17:39:48 Constantine Stone nods.

17:39:54 Constantine Stone says, "But the people I hurt never set foot in space."

17:40:05 You say, "It's going to be more dangerous for us and civilians if the outsiders attack and we leave the accord."

17:40:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is why you need a lawer because quitting won't likely rid you of any legal issues."

17:40:45 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, there's no getting out of legal issues, I know that."

17:40:50 You ask, "You think Best is going to take responsibility if we leave the Accord and thousands of innocent vicitms die?"

17:40:59 Constantine Stone says, "I just don't mean to run from them. I intend to go to Dure and let them decide what to do with me."

17:41:06 You say, "He won't. You'll just let him win by retiring."

17:41:09 Constantine Stone shakes his head.

17:41:14 Constantine Stone says, "No, I'm not retiring."

17:41:21 Constantine Stone says, "Just turning myself in to the authorities."

17:41:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok but they will assign you legal assistance."

17:41:51 You say, "If you need credits, I'll help pay."

17:41:54 Constantine Stone says, "If they do that, I won't refuse it, but I'm not fighting the charges."

17:41:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Whatever, we won't remove you from sEAS and same here."

17:42:04 Constantine Stone says, "I appreciate that."

17:42:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We'll chip in and help you."

17:42:08 Constantine Stone says, "I'm sorry I let you guys down."

17:42:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok."

17:42:14 Constantine Stone says, "I had hoped I could help you guys build up the org."

17:42:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You were caught up in the passion of the moment and I understand."

17:42:33 You say to Constantine, "You didn't let us down. You fought for something worth fighting for and you still should."

17:42:47 Constantine Stone says, "Not this way. I never wanted to kill anyone."

17:43:01 You nod to Constantine Stone. "None of us ever do."

17:43:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's tragic, it's horrible and I am so sorry for you and the victims and their families but it happened so you need to jsut do the best you can to go forward and you are doing the right thing but please don't quit piloting."

17:43:30 Shule nods in  agreement with Lily.

17:43:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident hugs Constantine Stone.

17:43:37 Constantine Stone says, "I don't intend to quit, but I expect my sentence may be..."

17:43:38 Constantine Stone says, "Long."

17:43:48 Constantine Stone says, "So I don't know that I'll ever see sky again."

17:43:51 You pat Constantine Stone on the back.

17:43:55 Constantine Stone says, "But facing the consequences is the right thing to do."

17:43:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We'll see but remember, we are here for you all the way."

17:44:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Which governments are doing that?"

17:44:04 You nod and nod.

17:44:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We care about you. We love you as family so we have to look out for one another."

17:44:40 Constantine Stone nods.

17:44:41 You nod.

17:44:44 Constantine smiles weakly.

17:44:45 Constantine Stone says, "Thanks guys."

17:44:50 You say, "Of course."

17:45:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure and please keep us posted and please if they ask for persons to contact, please tell them my name and if Shule wants, his too."

17:45:19 Constantine Stone nods.

17:45:21 You say, "Please do."

17:45:30 You say, "The can definitely contact me."

17:45:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Don't leave sEAS."

17:45:38 Constantine Stone says, "I won't."

17:45:42 You say, "Good."

17:45:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just please turn in any ships you still have."

17:45:46 Constantine Stone says, "I expect they'll revoke my license, though."

17:45:50 Constantine Stone says, "I returned the scout."

17:45:50 Constantine Stone nods.

17:45:54 Constantine Stone says, "And I sold the rest of mine."

17:45:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

17:45:57 Constantine Stone says, "Except the one I live in."

17:46:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well we'll see how it goes it may not be permanent."

17:46:14 Constantine Stone says, "But I'll have them repossess and liquidate that after I'm sentenced."

17:46:14 You say, "We'll hope for the best."

17:46:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "After all I believe you have a reasonable case. The circumstances aren't good but how were you to really know? I suppose they would say you should but I am not the one to judge."

17:47:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There's always traffic out there so I guess that's their case."

17:47:23 Constantine Stone says, "I don't know."

17:47:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

17:47:33 You say, "We'll just keep our fingers crossed for you."

17:47:35 Constantine Stone says, "I've asked Evenia to come collect my pet if I go to prison."

17:47:41 Constantine Stone says, "If she doesn't, I may ask one of you to."

17:47:46 You say, "Ok."

17:47:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No would love to have it it oculd stay with ours."

17:47:54 Constantine Stone says, "But I'll let you know."

17:47:57 Constantine Stone nods.

17:48:03 Constantine Stone says, "For now I'd like him to stay at home."

17:48:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Can you get me a key?"

17:48:11 Constantine Stone says, "But once they take me away I'll let you know."

17:48:13 Constantine Stone says, "Sure."

17:48:29 You say, "Get us a key before you head over there."

17:48:34 Constantine Stone nods.

17:48:34 You sigh.

17:48:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We'll keep it for you as Evenia probalby has more than she can handle."

17:48:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

17:48:57 Constantine Stone says, "Vanta knows Evenia, so I'd like her to have him, but I'd understand if she wants nothing to do with me now."

17:49:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "You have a key to William dove right?"

17:49:06 Constantine Stone says, "Either way I'll let you know what happens."

17:49:10 Constantine Stone says, "I don't think so."

17:49:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Grn."

17:49:16 Constantine Stone says, "For now I'm going to try to get some sleep."

17:49:22 Constantine Stone says, "I'll take no actions for a while."

17:49:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slides a "William Dove" key off of an enameled purple space cat keyring.

17:49:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives a "William Dove" key to Constantine Stone.

17:49:40 Constantine Stone says, "I'm still hoping the government will give us an exxact report on all the damage."

17:49:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So keep that as that's where your pet will be."

17:49:48 Constantine Stone says, "But at some point this evening I'll reign my office."

17:49:53 Constantine Stone says, "Resign."

17:49:53 Constantine Stone nods.

17:50:41 You frown. "I swear the Voice of the Corps office is cursed."

17:50:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah please as you know, let's be hopeful that the news were being over-sensaitonal. I don't want to discount the severety of the incident. I'm just saying and not to be in denial."

17:50:48 Constantine Stone smiles.

17:50:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at Constantine Stone.

17:51:01 Constantine Stone says, "It seems to be cursed, yeah."

17:51:02 You smile at Constantine Stone.

17:51:09 Constantine Stone says, "Hopefully, whoever has it next keeps their nose clean."

17:51:18 Constantine Stone asks, "And yeah, wouldn't it be great if this was a lie that Best leaked to the ISN?"

17:51:27 Constantine Stone says, "I'd still be in prison for life, probably, but at least no one would be hurt."

17:51:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Heh yeah so who is next? I doubt we will even get a voice as who is eligible now?"

17:51:42 You say, "I wouldn't put it past Best."

17:51:44 Constantine Stone says, "Dakhal, maybe."

17:51:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am but I don't htink I want to right now expecially."

17:52:00 You say, "I'm not touching that office again."

17:52:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's a hell hole."

17:52:14 You nod.

17:52:30 You say, "I'm happy being SDC for now."

17:52:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No matter what you do, it's just always messed up or messed with. I'm not the villain that others want to make me out to be."

17:52:46 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

17:52:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

17:53:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I won't revisit that now. Your issues are more important Constantine."

17:53:13 Constantine Stone nods.

17:53:17 Constantine Stone says, "Alright."

17:53:24 Constantine Stone says, "I'm going to go try to get some rest."

17:53:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So what ship will your pet be in?"

17:53:34 You wave to Constantine Stone.

17:53:39 You say to Constantine, "Rest well."

17:53:47 You say to Constantine, "And try to clear your head."

17:53:48 Constantine Stone says, "My mule Lion's Den, but don't take him yet."

17:53:49 Lily says to Constantine, "Yes try to get some rest."

17:53:54 Constantine Stone says, "Let him stay home as long as he can."

17:53:54 Constantine Stone nods.

17:54:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh sure will."

17:54:08 Constantine Stone waves.

17:54:13 Constantine Stone says, "Alright, thanks for the support, guys."

17:54:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But will be sure he's fed."

17:54:18 Constantine Stone nods.

17:54:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He might like playing with ours though."

17:54:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

17:54:35 Constantine Stone smiles.

17:56:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I knew he might be a little eratic especially over the incident with the prototype ship he destroyed."

17:56:48 You nod.

17:57:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I tried to talk him into jsut giving it back which is what I would have done."

17:57:04 You say, "Well, all we can do now is just be as supportive to him as we can."

18:05:54 You say, "Yeah, that's what I would have done."

18:06:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But still ather spearheaded all of this. I heard him on the aEU channel requesting that more starships be destroyed yet he wasn't doing any of it."

18:08:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps for some less-experienced like Constantine, he could have given some advise concerning starship destruciton. It's not a method we use on a regular basis."

18:08:37 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

18:09:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I certainly will volunteer to be a character witness for Constantine. Eli is obviously in as much trouble unless it was only Constantine who crashed into the Landing Pad?"

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

21:00:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:00:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:00:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:00:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:00:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:01:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:06:18 I don't understand that.

21:06:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:06:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:06:26 You peer out...

21:06:26 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

21:11:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

21:11:50 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It should be noted: AEU forces are holding position over New Earth at present time. An allied pirate or whatever the fuck they're calling themselves now pulsar jumped into New Earth orbit earlier, and when the navy, Shule and I responded, the pulsar transmitted farewell and left."

21:12:07 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Interesting."

21:12:20 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That kind of sounds like they're trying to goad you."

21:12:36 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or somethin..."

21:13:01 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Maybe. When we launched, I dampened its sensors. Then when I moved closer to it, it locked on to me, and I fired a disarming bolt. It left after that shot."

21:13:12 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

21:13:25 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah, I get the feeling they just wanted to make you respond."

21:41:52 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

22:30:41 Your communicator reports that...

22:30:41 
At least five recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

22:33:14 [Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Huh... I just seen a warship jump through the dusty reaches."

22:33:24 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:33:24 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:33:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:33:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:33:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:33:42 The ship is already moving.

22:33:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:33:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Dusty Reaches. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:33:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:33:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

22:33:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:33:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:33:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:33:52 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly wi
23:33:54 th his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.
