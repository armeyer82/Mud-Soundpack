00:02 Damien says to you, "How you doing?"

00:03 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders in from the south.

00:03 Nicolette Lawrence rolls in from the south.

00:03 Suddenly there is no more road ahead of you, and the carriage is plunging down a steep hillside, barely under control.

00:03 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

00:04 Nicolette Lawrence sighs.

00:04 The carriage bumps heavily over a rock and then arrives back on the road.

00:04 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

00:05 You wave to Nicolette Lawrence.

00:05 Nicolette Lawrence waves and waves.

00:05 The horses cease their panic, and breathe hard as they resume a more normal pace.

00:05 Damien Alexander waves to Nicolette Lawrence.

00:05 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

00:05 Damien says to you, "Hanging in there, I guess."

00:15 Queenie the big violet bobtailed felo wanders west.

00:15 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:16 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

00:16 A readout shows Asteroid Cluster 6364-5354 about 18.4 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Southsouthwest and Slightly Down.
An astable riftstorm appears to be 3.32 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Southwest and Up.

00:16 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

00:16 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

00:16 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:16 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Reps."

00:16 Damien Alexander stands up from a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

00:16 Damien Alexander tramps south.

00:16 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone coming out?"

00:17 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Hang on."

00:17 You stand up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:18 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Engineering Room]

00:18 The engineering room of a starship should be a clean, sterile working environment. This room, however, is filled with command consoles that have cables visibly snaking across the floor, finding their way through ductwork to reach deep within the bowels of the ship. The ship is portrayed on several data displays, with stylised symbols representing specific ship components to aid in damage level monitoring, system limitation and repair. A small, basic starmap display is placed on a pivot on the ceiling, but it seems to be an afterthought as any operator would have to turn around to face it when at a control board attempting to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

01:18 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

01:25 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:25 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

01:25 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

01:34 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

02:14 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

02:14 The starship has arrived on the very limits of a solar system, the first point where the local star's influence on gravity is anything more than negligible. The star itself is merely a distant glinting point, indistinguishable from any of the millions of distant but brighter stars also in view. This is an Oort cloud, a massive sphere of captured comets, asteroids, and similar interstellar flotsam.

02:14 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

04:36 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Meow the little calico CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.

04:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:37 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:37 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:37 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Happy, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a 
04:37 letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps
04:37  and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 13 November 2317 GST. Time remaining: 12 days, 20 hours, 24 minutes, and 17 seconds

13:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Dearest Lily,
The last few weeks have really been difficult for me. Many things have been weighing on my mind. It definitely was part of the reason why I got so upset at you the other night. I know it was unfair to you and for that I apologize.
Several situations have forced me to reconsider where my life is going and whether or not piloting is really the best career choice for me. Therefore, I feel it would be best for me to take some significant time off of work so that I can do some very deep soul searching. I feel the need to regroup and ground myself again. I am not however, going to turn in my license quite yet. It is a big decision and one I will not take lightly.
As for us, I will definitely miss you. You mean the universe to me and I'm sorry if I have done a poor job of showing it. I would prefer that you wait for me, but I understand if you decide to get involved with others. I don't know yet how long I'll be gone and therefore, it would not be fair for me to ask you to wait. If in the end I decide to leave piloting forever, I will be sure to return any personal belongings I have of yours prior to doing so. My last day of work will be either Friday or Saturday. This will give me time to resign from my office as SDC.
I love you with all of my heart and will miss you dearly.
Forever Yours,
Shule

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch
18:51 ow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
