00:03 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Just one."

00:03 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "May I join?"

00:03 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Sure, meet on chet."

00:03 [Tactical Communication] Kerry Rodriguez transmits an irritating burst of static.

00:03 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "When?"

00:04 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "In 20 seconds i'll be landing, so assume now."

00:07 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

00:17 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

00:23 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

00:33 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

00:39 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "1 for gunship beacons?"

00:39 A short gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

00:49 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

00:55 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine, I am ready if you want to try to gather folks."

00:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What are you all wanting to do? I am somewhat limited on time but I will commit to the special mission or to cleans Old Frontier."

01:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, okay. We were thinking of attackng a turtle ship."

01:00 Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

01:01 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.

01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How many do we need for that, 4?"

01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah."

01:01 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.

01:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Generally a league to do the flashy stuff. Maybe Ather can suggest alternatives though."

01:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can, I can."

01:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It all depends on what we get for the run."

01:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That is true."

01:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So I guess Shule isn't hearing us or something. If we had just us four though what would you suggest as a configuration Ather?"

01:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Put out the call on tactical, constantine. We probably want tier 5."

01:06 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A tier 5 damage suit for a turtle mission?"

01:06 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I forget, can other alliances help?"

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Fringe or EAOS then?"

01:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fringe or EAOS?"

01:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We would have an AEU tier 5 as a repairing suit, and that tier 5 AEU suit will have a lot of the readily available light abilities such as illuminate, laser guidance and flash. Just have to make sure it doesn't flare."

01:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fringe."

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fringe, if you would."

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "New Eartt?"

01:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I can either be that suit or a fringe."

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes please."

01:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So guess I bring AEU? Or do you want to Ather."

01:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Uh."

01:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well Ather will have to bring the tank suit, right?"

01:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We have Ted in a fringe."

01:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We no longer have access to a League Constantine but yeah."

01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, shoot. Can we not use the turtle suit to tank?"

01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's just fine, I can tank using the thrall suit thing."

01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."

01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily, do you have a fringe suit?"

01:09 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Stay clear of tesla."

01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, my fringe is only tier 4, I forgot that. I should probably run repairs."

01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Do you have the light module on your AEu Constantine?"

01:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do."

01:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily. Do you have a fringe suit?"

01:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup."

01:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You're fringe. Constantine, you're AEU."

01:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or the Thrall suit."

01:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool. Now I think I heard someone say some time ago that we take this in a cruiser with a mule docked?"

01:11 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:11 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, the navy sends a lot of ships to help, but the cruiser method is probably the best method. It will leave the cruiser vulnerable while we destroy the battleship though."

01:11 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

01:11 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:11 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:11 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily, we're waiting for you in the lounge."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm still short lock evasions for a cruiser."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Note: this will probably take at least an hour to an hour and a half. I hope you all have the time."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I should be good."

01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The cruise ris taken care of."

01:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The guy won't talk to me."

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why not?"

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The guy on Steel command?"

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure. He says he doesn't think I can be of any help."

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Interesting. I wonder what the requirements are."

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah well."

01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah."

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What's your Ground Combat Constantine?"

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "1538."

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I need 1800."

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does the suit only come as a tier 5?"

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Doubtful. That makes no sense since there are lower tiers of those suits available."

01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm that should be sufficient for more than the lowest tier at the minim and yeah what Ather said."

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You don't think it's the ship I went there in?"

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Doubtful. I think I went there in uh, my destroyer."

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay."

01:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But feel free to try."

01:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah I don't even remember but yeah maybe I did go over in a gem but it shouldn't ever matter."

01:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nope."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, I think I kind of remember talking to him some time ago."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder what changed."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Did you maybe assign the mission then?"

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't believe so, as I have none pending."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess I can't be sure."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's not an officila mission like all that."

01:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any way I would check?"

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily, come to the lounge. Let's head out there and see what happens."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You too, constantine."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

01:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."

01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I genuinely hope you did not assign the mission back then, or we're going to have some pissed off naval officers later on."

01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think I did."

01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That doesn't sound like something I would do."

01:23 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:31 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

01:35 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:39 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:55 A short gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:03 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

02:03 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a new notice.

02:04 Minor Change: Communicator channel 5 now simulcasts to any other allied alliances. For example, if the AEU and EAOS were allied, anything said on channel 5 on the EAOS channel would also broadcast on the AEU's channel 5.

02:05 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

02:05 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a new notice.

02:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry about that guys, I was using only minors before they replicated but they still hit me a couple times."

02:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then I couldn't keep up once there were 4 of them."

02:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No wor-r-r-rr-r-r-ries. aaaabort for-r-r-r noooow. Thiiiis will require careful con-n-n-nsideration-n-n-n. We wen-n-n-nt wr-r-r-rong somewhere, and I need t-t-t-to figure out-t-t-t where."

02:15 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:19 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Tesla clear by the way. Sorry folks."

02:19 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Oh uh, forgot to say, yeah."

02:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:31 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

02:41 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

02:55 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with narrow dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

03:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alright, I think next time things will go much more smoothly! Take heart, take heart!"

03:13 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a
03:13  dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, a small Bari-shaped tidbit, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

03:13 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

03:13 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:14 You're already sitting.

03:14 The ship is already moving.

03:14 The ship is already moving.

03:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:14 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:14 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:14 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

03:41 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:47 a Tardick lizard named Asteria

03:47 This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA. Its stomach is bulging, but it seems content to slowly digest its large meal.

05:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

05:42 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
