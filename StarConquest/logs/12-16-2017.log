12:09 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

12:09 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

12:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
The ship is already moving.

12:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

12:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:12 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:12 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

12:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:13 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

12:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

12:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:13 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:17 Oh no! You currently do not have any proteges!

12:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:51 You say to Lily, "Nope, couldn't chase you cause you weren't awake yet."

13:51 Lily Kaise asks, "Oh wow can you believe this term is nearly over again?"

13:51 You nod.

13:52 Lily Kaise says, "You should still nominate yourself. There isn't really anyone else who can serve so just do the best you can and that's enough."

13:52 You frown. "Ok."

13:52 Lily Kaise says, "Heck when we were gone, nobody challenged us."

13:53 Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.

13:53 You say, "True."

13:53 You say, "I'm trying to convince Vernos and Constantine that lasers are really worth it on AEu ships. It's kind of common sense, but..."

14:01 Lily Kaise says, "Vernos obviously can't qualify for the better lasers either so still, they do get the bonus."

14:02 You nod.

14:03 You say, "Yeah."

14:03 Lily Kaise says, "They need to look at the damage output and do the math behind the multiple number of lasers versus the single torp or for chainguns perhaps at their level of combat, the damage and such might seem more but there's the downtime for reloading and the time it takes to fire."

14:03 You say, "Exactly."

14:04 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

14:04 Lily Kaise says, "They've been brainwashed by other pilots who when they have lasers, don't have the added benefit we have just as we don't on chainguns or torpedos."

14:05 You say, "Yeah, that's why I like AEU pilots to learn combat from other AEU pilots."

14:05 You say, "I'm not trying to be a separatist or anything when I say that. Our ships take a different type of tactic some times."

14:06 Lily Kaise says, "It has nothing to do with separatism."

14:06 Lily Kaise says, "It's just the abilities of our ships and weapons versus another alliance."

14:06 You say, "I know."

14:07 You say, "Exactly."

14:08 Lily Kaise says, "They can't install lasers and receive the same result and our ships have a difference in engine speed."

14:08 You nod and smile.

14:14 Lily Kaise says, "Woo if my cap keeps progressing, later today I'll have reached that 10K mark in exploration."

14:14 You cheer for Lily Kaise!

14:14 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah... I had no idea..."

18:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.
