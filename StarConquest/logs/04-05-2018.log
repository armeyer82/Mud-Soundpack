-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I'm pleased to see you engaging in Ground Combat work. However, please be certain to observe your battlesuit's damage, repair in between battles, take cover if your damage is high and if you don't have the REPAIR ability on your Battlesuit, use Repair drones to obtain enough repairs. Also, launch and obtain a repair from the Battlesuit Outfitter if the damage is too high to repair. If you need tips on managing your Ground Combat tactics, please seek us out and ask questions. On the conference room table of the Liaison Office building, there is a box which contains two different books on Ground Combat. Please read these books. The Battle Scanner West of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector and the Salvage processing stations east of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector will be renewed in a few hours. Please be certain to Transfer after you have completed your salvaging work. If you are uncertain as to how to access these stations, just ask us and we'll assist you. Fly safely and fight hard on the ground! [19:46  3 April 2318 GST]
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: AEU pilots: having not received a lot of letters from people telling me about times of availability, I'm just going to set up a meeting. If you all can come, great. If not, I don't want to see letters or messages from people saying "well, that time was not good for me." You all were given the option of sending me your times of availability. All that being said, the meeting will be on Saturday, at 19:00. This should be a decent time for pretty much all people who have weird hours of wakefulness and activity. The meeting is to discuss the current status of the AEU pilot corps, and to see if we can find some common ground to end the devisiveness between pilots in the corps. I also have some information that I would like to share with the rest of the pilots related to some discussions I had with Keegan on the most recent expedition. I hope to see you all there! Remember, Saturday, 19:00, New Earth conference room. [21:07  3 April 2318 GST]
Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings Everyone! The Battle Scanner West of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector and the Salvage processing station east of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector are now renewed and functional. After you have completed your salvaging work, please be certain to Transfer your debris to this Salvage Processing station. Then when the Transfer of debris has completed, be certain to exit your Starship and go up to the Control Room of the Salvage processing Station and press the TRANSFER Button so that your Credits and Points will be sent to you. Regarding the Battle Scanner West of Steel Phoenix Command, You should not attempt a Beacon Drop until you have received instructions from someone who has performed Beacon Drops before.

01:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:33 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:33 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:33 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

01:33 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

01:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

01:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:33 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:33 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 736" has jumped into the sector.

01:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.
The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

01:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:33 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:33 You scramble to your feet.

01:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:33 You exit the ship.

01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid transmits, "Sure. I've lost my fighter though, overestimated my fighting abilities... But I think I'll be okay with a cargo one too against rats."

01:34 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a mail bin. You grab it off the belt, eager to see its contents.

01:34 I don't understand that.

01:34 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

Hello,
Currently we are maintaining Salvage and BAS Stations East and West of Steel Phoenix Command. If your organization would like to participate, please load two of each of the following: Basic Control Center top, Storage Container Unmanned Pickup Modules and Cores into SEAS Warehouse or onto a Module Transport and send me a key which I would distribute to Shule and Constantine who are SEAS Trustees and assist with station building at times. Also, please try to maintain that there are two of each of these modules on hand most of the time as These stations will be replaced about every 12 days.
These stations are not teeming with activity. However with the current presence of a number of new pilots in both AEU and Fringe, these Income-producing Temporary Space Stations have the potential to yield greater activity and Income and Megacredits for all involved.
As for the Alliance Core Module, we will alternate with Fringe and AEU Cores on these stations
The following would occur. for one cycle of stations, the BAS would contain a Fringe Core and the Salvage Processor would contain AN AEU Core. Subsequently, this would be reversed for the next build of these two Temporary Stations as they would be alternated per each cycle of stations.
By having Tops and Ejecter Modules, on hand I could assure that both RUNE and ICE would always be incorporated into both of these Temporary Stations.
If there is a future consensus amongst 
01:35 us to support an Asteroid processor and for special occasions when there are artifacting trips/pilots express more interest in artifacting, we can establish a Xenology Station. The Xenology Scanner Module is a very expensive Module. The current one which Starseekers can obtain costs 14 Megacredits. Therefore, it is not very justifiable at this time.
Please let me know your thoughts, concerns or if you'd like to participate, etc as soon as possible.
I will be replacing the BAS and the Salvage Processor stations sometime tomorrow and I will wait until around 1400 for your response.
Kind regards,
Lily Kaies

01:36 You put a fine piece of paper with an official header reading "From the founder of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars" in a leather briefcase.

01:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well there is nothing wrong with the Fighter. Many experienced pilots upgrade those and still use them."

01:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yep, my fighter has seen quite a bit of combat."

01:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And actually, I'd suggest renting a ship to do beacon drops as opposed to waiting until you can get your own."

01:37 The sensor systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

01:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid transmits, "Aa, well then, will purchase one as soon as get back to the New Earth. But I won't drop beacons anymore..."

01:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid laughs.

01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I learned a lot from flying beacon drops in rented ships until I could get my own upgraded ships."

01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "There you go a little more. Unfortunately that is all I can send you until you have your full license."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

01:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid transmits, "I think rats was the smallest of my problems. Outsider escort ships were much worse when I was trying to hit them."

01:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid transmits, "Well, at least I can say I did."

01:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wait now! What strenth of Beacon did you deploy?"

02:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid transmits, "Hehe, mine was very low, and second hit got my ship destroyed. I was going with others, there was various levels."

02:01 I don't understand that.

02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh that's why when you have more than one ship in the sector, it will draw more and higher. So it's not a good practiceto run Very Low Strength Beacons, please only do those solo."

02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, we can do some beacon drops together some time."

02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Sure can."

02:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You silly!"

02:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid laughs.

02:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But honestly, if you like help learning how to fly, gun or whatever. Let me know. I have been known to have a bit of knowledge concerning space combat. Some of it is even good knowledge."

02:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid transmits, "Ahaha, okay!"

02:08 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:08 You're already sitting.

02:08 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:09 The ship is already moving.

02:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:09 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:09 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

02:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:09 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:09 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:09 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:09 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:10 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:11 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hello Samuel and welcome!"

02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Samuel Dunston transmits, "Hi."

02:37 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Anna Danhid transmits, "Hey there."

02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hello."

03:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Where did you hid yourself Shule?"

03:13 Not much to see out there.

03:13 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

03:13 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

03:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm in my flare."

03:13 You scramble to your feet.

03:13 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:13 You exit the ship.

03:13 [The Torus; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.

03:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:13 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a small mystic purple bioplastic crate, and a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:13 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a small dusky pink trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a bag of felo treats, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

03:13 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:13 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Now I'm in Dove."

03:13 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:13 You laugh.

03:14 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I was just in Starfish after I set up the stations as I didn't have time to fly back to here. Then I just came back."

03:14 You say, "Ah ok."

03:14 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:14 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:15 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:15 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:15 You say to Lily, "I lov eyou."

03:15 Lily Kaise asks, "Did you get your chips form the proceeds of the trip?"

03:15 You say, "I did."

03:15 Lily Kaise grins.

03:15 You grin.

03:15 Lily says to you, "I love you too!"

03:16 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:16 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

03:17 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

03:18 A large semi-transparent perfectly round creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

03:18 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:20 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:28 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

03:28 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Need salvagers and at least one defender for a salvage op."

03:28 Lily Kaise says, "Eat your heart out morris."

03:29 Lily Kaise says, "Or let your selfishness and envy and jealousy eat your heart."

03:29 "No kidding!" You nod.

03:29 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:29 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:30 You ask, "Wait, he has a heart?"

03:30 You say, "I mean..."

03:30 You chuckle.

03:30 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:30 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah that's a stretch right?"

03:30 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:30 You laugh.

03:30 Lily Kaise says, "That is one more evil dude."

03:31 You exclaim, "No kidding!"

03:31 You say to Lily, "I'm so glad you never dated him."

03:31 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh gods! I didn't like him from the beginning of time!"

03:32 You laugh.

03:32 Lily Kaise says, "Besides, you know it would be rare that I would date anyone but someone form aEU."

03:32 You say, "That's true."

03:32 You say, "I've only ever dated people from the AEU."

03:32 Lily Kaise says, "Well you are the only one I've dated so."

03:33 You grin.

03:33 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:33 You say, "I should have only dated you, but I figured I never had a chance anyways."

03:33 You laugh.

03:34 Lily Kaise says, "Well you never tried... initially..."

03:34 You say, "True."

03:34 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with narrow dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:35 You exclaim, "That was partly because I figured you were way out of my league!"

03:35 You grin.

03:36 You say, "Many more experienced, better-looking, and far more skilled pilots have had an interest in you."

03:36 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Nope none better looking than you!"

03:37 Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:37 You say, "Awww, thanks, but I hardly believe that."

03:37 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:37 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

03:37 Lily Kaise says, "I do because most of the male pilots I have encountered are so ugly."

03:37 You laugh.

03:38 Lily Kaise says, "Not that looks are everything but some rather scare me."

03:38 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Tabloid."

03:38 You say, "Oh come on now. Many women like Damien Alexander, Cesar and Blake."

03:38 Lily Kaise says, "Oh man."

03:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:39 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

03:39 Lily Kaise says, "Hey I hope they shit on all of their snottly little hairdos."

03:39 You say, "Those three could get just about any woman they wanted."

03:39 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

03:39 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't like any of them."

03:40 You say, "Well, that I figured out."

03:40 You grin.

03:42 You nod. "Well, the Fringe had a bad habit of stealing my siginificant others."

03:42 You exclaim, "And wow! That's insane!"

03:43 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

03:43 You say, "Cesar, because he was an Ace, Blake because he was cruiser qualified, and Damien, well. I don't know why and neither... Well, I won't mention his name as I highly dislike the fourth."

03:44 'mike' could refer to more than one person. Please be more specific.

03:46 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...tryin again. Need one or two defenders and salvagers for an op."

03:46 You say, "I'll give you a hint about the fourth. He was the one who got in a physical confrontation with the space bus driver."

03:46 Lily Kaise says, "I used to go out to GMG with Alexander because we worked well together but he already had a girlfriend and I was not interested in anyone from Fringe."

03:46 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:46 [Tactical Communication] Petra Summers transmits, "I can salvage."

03:47 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "I will defend."

03:47 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Petra what grade can you salvage?"

03:47 Lily Kaise says, "Blake is rather dull and pretty stupid in many respects. Can you believe that as long as he's been a pilot, he didn't even have a Jet so he could go outside of the starship? Come on now."

03:47 Lily Kaise asks, "Those cost what less than 5 million?"

03:47 [Tactical Communication] Petra Summers transmits, "I have the mighty grapple 1."

03:47 You say, "Well like I said. The Fringe had a bad habit of stealing away my significant others. Cesar, because he was an Ace, Blake because he was cruiser qualified and Damien and the fourth because... Well, I don't know why."

03:47 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. Right now if we do the op in Orion, I have too many defenders and not enough salvagers."

03:47 You nod to Lily Kaise. "Wow1 that's insane1."

03:48 [Tactical Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "We are turing in our scoop in orion."

03:48 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Morris I can salvage."

03:48 [Tactical Communication] Petra Summers transmits, "So I can grapple up to grade 40."

03:48 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, need you to be able to get 40 to 60 if we do it at 285."

03:48 [Tactical Communication] Petra Summers transmits, "Oh darn."

03:51 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

03:56 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...Defense meet in the Old Earth lounge other'n Evenia. That's Petra and the Timothies."

03:56 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Salvagers are Johann, Hank, and Ari."

03:56 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I know. I'm not worried."

03:56 [Tactical Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Wooh on way out there now."

03:56 [Tactical Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "285?"

03:57 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway, being cruiser-qualified isn't what makes a man for me."

03:57 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

03:57 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:57 Lily says to you, "That is just a nice benefit!"

03:57 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Salvagers, be very careful please. 200 each so folks don't get shorted."

03:57 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:57 [Tactical Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Roger that."

03:57 Lily Kaise beams at you.

03:57 You ask, "I should work on my cruiser qualification then, right?"

03:57 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Morris Let me know when you want me to hop on out there."

03:57 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:57 Lily Kaise says, "No."

03:58 You chuckle.

03:58 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Not at all!"

03:58 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Any time. Checkin ammo."

03:58 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Just forget it!"

03:58 You laugh.

03:58 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:58 Lily Kaise tickles you!

03:58 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:58 Lily Kaise says, "I'm not discounting that Love. I hope you know what I meant."

03:59 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I do. I was just having fun teasing you."

03:59 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:00 You say, "I am not worried about anyone stealing you away from me. Don't worry."

04:02 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

04:03 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

04:04 You stroke the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

04:04 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

04:07 Shine the big white glowing felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

04:09 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's unlocked, Eve."

04:10 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:10 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:11 You beam at Lily Kaise.

04:11 Shine the big white glowing felo curls up and closes its eyes.

04:21 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:22 A small thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

04:36 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

04:38 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

04:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

04:42 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

04:44 A large semi-transparent perfectly round creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

05:00 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with narrow dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

05:03 You say to Lily, "Let's go lie down my dearest love."

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "Ok Hun."

20:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:16 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:37 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:37 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

20:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:37 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:38 I don't understand that.

20:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:38 You remove a secondary pilot command access unit from a leather briefcase.

20:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Five jumps to The Vortex. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Deep Wastes."

20:38 You stand up from a black leather captain's chair.

20:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:38 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

20:38 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

20:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The sensors tell you that this area is full of valuable salvage, but all you can see of it yourself is dark smudges that block the light of the stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Four jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:38 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon A-45."

20:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:38 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:38 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon A-49."

20:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:38 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Hamilton's Funnel."

20:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:38 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:38 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Vortex."

20:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:38 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

20:38 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:38 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

20:38 I don't understand that.

20:38 There are no other ships in the sector.

20:38 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (2, 12, 20)

20:38 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

20:38 
Accord starship departed to Unclaimed sector The Dusty Reaches (Beta-3) approximately 2 minutes ago.

20:39 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

20:39 You lift a small plastic cover and press a green button.

20:39 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

20:39 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (2, 12, 20)

20:39 You activate the long-range scanner and search for passive detections and recent ping returns.

22:51 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:51 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:51 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:51 The starship is already undergoing launch procedures.

22:51 [Tactical Communication] Petra Summers transmits, "Johann, repair as we said before?"

22:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:51 The ship is already moving.

22:51 The ship is already moving.

22:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:51 The ship is already moving.

22:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

22:51 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:51 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

22:51 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Rats is best I can do. It's not much of a repair suit, it's much more support."

22:52 I don't understand that.
