-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, a
robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated
cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Shine the big white glowing felo
here.

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

[Telex-Providence Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Newly constructed, this spaceport landing pad is among the largest and most
technologically advanced in any alliance. The seemingly endless expanse of
smooth pavement is nevertheless dwarfed by an absolutely massive tree trunk that
towers hundreds of meters above the pad and the surrounding forest. The trunk is
broken off near the top, and the jagged edges remain, though they are crowned by
a huge glass dome. A large archway has been carved into the base of the trunk,
and through the crystalline sliding doors you can make out a palatially scaled
spaceport concourse thronged with pilots, travellers, and civilian employees. A
large number of ships are scattered across the pad, with a variety of hoses,
machines, and droids attached to them. Every few minutes, the thunderous sound
of a ship's atmospheric thrusters obliterates any other sounds in the area.
The two-person light transport "Treasure Box", the vostok-class capsule "A Very
Long Name For A Very Little Ship", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are
landed here.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person light transport "Non Serviam Redux". The organization has earned
541,714.66 credits.
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Who exactly are you refusing to
serve?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Unbelievable."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They think the pilots
were tricked into voting against Outccord?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh is that what they meant?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah sighs. "Apparently, somehow."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I guess. Was it really
loaded?"
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Wait, what? What is the
wording they are referring to?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So yeah what did it say."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't remember it
word for word now, but I didn't think it was loaded. It was perhaps a bit longer
than usual."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wouldn't it have been easier
to say, do you support outccord, yes or no?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's how our first
vote was worded that was also unanimous, at the very start of this."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes, but if you can rig the
question so that every answer supports it, then you look better in the media."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I very much doubt that was the
point."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So why did you take a second
vote, and why change the wordin for a second vote?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'm suspecting to get enough
media spin to muddy the waters. But that's just an educated guess."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um no, that's not what
we were trying to do, we weren't trying to do anything deceptive."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh you guys ran a new vote. Ok
I misread this apparently."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok I withdraw my comment."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So take another vote and just
put it plain and simple. Do you, a pilot of the AEU civilian corps, support the
AEU withdrawl from the Accord of Free Worlds...if ya want it to be all flowery
and whatnot. But if ya throw things in bout what a bad idea it is and stuff,
it's easily construed as bein a loaded question."

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, a
robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated
cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Shine the big white glowing felo
here.

Attention pilots! Earlier today, the Dusty Reaches was held under siege. I
responded with a crew around 13:15, but no ships were found in the sector. Less
than an hour later, just after 14:00, IFS warships were discovered in the Dusty
Reaches. Those who could respond including myself, assembled at Old Earth and
boarded a cruiser. There were not enough pilots for a full crew, but we chose to
engage anyways. When we arrived, there were three Poseidon-class warships, two
Artemis-class warships, and two Ares-class warships. The Accord responded with
their own cruiser, a destroyer and a couple of gunboats. The IFS were
successfully driven from the sector and the siege ended. Please stay vigilant
and careful. I truly hope this is not a sign of things to come.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "An

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"Indeed. I have a theory that Teslatown activities don't actually account
towards the conquest unless the teslabucks are turned in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"Because points aren't credited unless you report your work by turning in
teslabucks."

could work on their tesla without messing with the strike."

to get the votes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually ISN

that you gotta watch out for the most."

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Defiance" has jumped out of
the sector.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Defiance" has jumped out of
the sector.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Defiance" has jumped out of
the sector.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee with a large neon purple dragon
appliqued on the front, a pair of body-skimming white lowrise capri jeans with
periwinkle blue and coral pink jeweled flowers on the front and back pockets,
and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white
blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a
perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the
side, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head,
face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, waist, and both ankles are left

one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, a
robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated black cooler, a small red insulated
cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, a pair of gray canvas sneakers, a pair
of shiny buttercup yellow patent leather clogs, and Prissy the big violet
long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
