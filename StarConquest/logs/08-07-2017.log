make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstel
00:43:25 lar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

00:44:20 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:44:20 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:44:22 Not much to see out there.

00:45:05 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

00:45:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:45:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:45:10 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:45:11  You are wearing a lightweight navy wool suit jacket, a long-sleeved white cotton dress shirt, a pair of pleated front slim fit navy wool dress pants, and a pair of black patent leather oxfords. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of black silk socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:45:12 You are carrying nothing.

00:45:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:45:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:45:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:46:09 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.

00:46:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:46:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:46:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:46:44 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:46:47 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

00:46:47 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

00:46:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:47:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:47:15 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:47:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:47:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:47:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:47:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:47:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:27:27 [MTTS] andawn: Which message?

01:27:51 [MTTS] kaite: Just try gulping down some food.

01:27:55 [General Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Just let me know. I need the points."

01:28:10 [MTTS] usfolks: I'm amused. Now everyone is going to gulp food.

01:31:58 [MTTS] kaite: Oh ok well yeah sometimes, yeah, guess it's akin to the rats core random kind of thing.

01:31:58 [MTTS] Ulias: Now we need a headline about strange new snake-lilke eating trend hahaha.
[MTTS] kaite: Heh wouldn't put it past the media. They are everywhere! They are everywhere!

01:32:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:32:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:33:08 [MTTS] usfolks: Well, if this discourages people from having figures like models and eating like they should weigh 400 pounds, go for it. Heh.

01:33:42 [MTTS] Ulias: There's people like that in real life though. We probably all know at least one.

01:34:16 [MTTS] usfolks: Next game feature: Star Conquest introduces the SpaceTapeworm.

01:34:36 [MTTS] Butchulla: Let me know in advance so I can hide?

01:34:36 [MTTS] me: Ha haha.

01:34:38 [MTTS] andawn: Space tape.

01:34:50 [MTTS] moose: Oh my...

01:34:58 [MTTS] usfolks: We already have spaceworms. Might as well have a space tapeworm. Right?

01:35:06 [MTTS] Squidmind: This is not a general use ooc channel.

01:35:26 [MTTS] usfolks: Sorry Squid.

01:35:34 [MTTS] andawn: Sorry.

01:35:41 [MTTS] kaite: Hmm well people do tend to enjoy food that they aren't able to enjoy when they encounter it but that doesn't mean they eat that way all of the time.

01:40:53 [MTTS] Ulias: If I found a space game that can be beaten in like ten to twenty minutes that I think the staff would enjoy and perhaps even be interested in creating an Sc counterpart, sorta like how Trade cycles and Horrible People have real world counterparts, would that be best shared through a ticket, or would that something that should go on messages to the staff board?

01:41:33 [MTTS] Ulias: Even if you guys aren't interested I making an SC port, I think you would get a kick out of this.

01:50:14 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
Lileah Rose is asleep.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a large leather lounge couch.)

01:51:52 You peer out...

01:51:52 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The Torus docking bays consist of sterile silver-colored walls, floor, and ceiling. Somehow, even with people coming and going constantly, the floor is kept completely clean. An unknown technology allows the docking bay to remain open to space while holding air. You see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star outside. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility is to the east, and the starship supply store is to the west.
The three-person heavy cruiser "Refracted Reality", the one-person marauder "Optic Nerve", the two-person syphon "Mentally Drained", the two-person asteroid hauler "Smells Like Cheese", the one-person flitter "Back To Basics", the one-person flitter "Typical", and the two-person light freighter "Sandbagger" are docked here.
You see Larry the droid, Erika the droid, a shiny blue medical drone, a spherical security drone, a spherical security drone, and a police drone here.
You can go north, east, west, and down.

01:51:56 There are 2 players connected:

01:51:57 Rolando Caganda  (A)      Darren Amari  (A) [n]      

01:53:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:53:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:53:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:53:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:53:25 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:53:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:53:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:53:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:53:41 There are no other ships or debris in this sector.

01:53:47 Would you like to see the FTL map?

01:54:26 You have selected Sector 28: Chetumal.

01:54:27 Please confirm. [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:54:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

01:54:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:54:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:54:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:54:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Cardenas.

01:54:57 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:54:59 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

01:55:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:55:01    Planets:

Would you like to request landing clearance at Chetumal?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

01:55:25 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

01:55:28 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

01:55:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Sandbagger.  The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

01:55:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:55:36 You smile at Lileah Rose.

01:55:39 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

01:55:40 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

01:55:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:55:46 Lileah Rose blinks.

01:55:50 Lileah Rose grins at you.

01:56:02 Lileah Rose asks, "so what's up?"

01:56:18 You say, "I wanted to look around Ixtapa more to see if I could figure out where to get the stun cannons."

01:56:29 Lileah Rose asks, "oh want me to go with you?"

01:56:36 Lileah Rose asks, "or would you rather i didn't?"

01:56:38 You smile at Lileah Rose.

01:56:46 You say, "You are always welcome to come along.,"

01:56:59 Lileah Rose kisses you.

01:58:44 
[Chetumal; Ship Shop]

Teenagers accelerate past you on reactionless footjets, braking abruptly in front of stores or apartments, or skimming at reckless speeds down ramps leading to lower levels. A section of missing rail to the east turns out, upon careful examination, to lead to a steep ramp.

02:34:08 You can go west.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:34:10 [Ixtapa; Ledge]

02:34:11 You are standing upon a ledge only a few meters wide, which runs for a short distance along Ixtapa's outer wall. You glance over the edge occasionally, but your vision is obscured by mist and various city pollutions long before the surface becomes visible. The section of ledge ends in a thick wall, which extends upward to the top of the city. A nearby dark corner is partially eroded.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go west.

02:34:23 I see no "corner" here.

02:34:28 [Ixtapa; Dark Corner]

02:34:28 You can go out.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:34:30 I don't understand that.

02:34:32 [Ixtapa; Dark Corner]

02:34:32 You find yourself standing in a corner formed by two of Ixtapa's outer walls, which are effectively blocking out all sunlight. Squinting at the eroded concrete, you notice more damage than was originally visible. In fact, something has eaten a large tunnel through the concrete, and you see a dim light at the other end.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go out.

02:34:47 Lileah Rose says, "wait"

02:34:48 You say, "ick"

02:34:53 You say, "ok"

02:34:55 You find yourself standing in a corner formed by two of Ixtapa's outer walls, which are effectively blocking out all sunlight.

02:35:04 I see no "tunnel" here.

02:35:37 Lileah Rose just went into a hole in the concrete.

02:35:41 [Ixtapa; Cramped Tunnel]

02:35:41 Lileah Rose is here.
You can go southeast.

02:35:44 You say, "hi"

02:35:48 You hold Lileah Rose's hand, taking her into your group.

02:35:51 Lileah Rose grins at you.

02:35:53 You kiss Lileah Rose.

02:35:55 I don't understand that.

02:35:56 [Ixtapa; Artificial Cavern]

02:35:57 You can go north, south, and northwest.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:35:59 [Ixtapa; Artificial Cavern]

02:36:00 A miniature city seems to have been built here, deep within Ixtapa. A cluster of lights, some of them functional, has been suspended from the ceiling. Groups of buildings of various sizes extend toward the back of the cavern, to the east. Small, dark people glance at you suspiciously as they go about their obscure business. Some barely-recognizable modern version of electronic music blasts loudly from somewhere in the northern part of the cavern.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go north, south, and northwest.

02:36:13 Lileah Rose says, "wow"

02:36:22 [Ixtapa; Artificial Cavern]

02:36:22 The light is more dim here, and the densely-packed clusters of buildings close in on you. Small, poorly-maintained droids carry large boxes of materials back and forth among the buildings. You feel constantly watched by the inhabitants of the cavern, although they are rarely visible. A small path snakes through the buildings to the east.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go east and south.

02:36:29 [Artificial Cavern; Path]

02:36:30 You can go southeast and west.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:36:33 I don't understand that.

02:36:34 [Artificial Cavern; Path]

02:36:35 This path is almost completely unlit, and you wonder how the inhabitants of the cavern manage to navigate among their closely-packed buildings. You suspect that you are being avoided, as the dark, flitting shapes you saw from beyond the path have now gone. You share the path with only automated droids, which clank heavily along the concrete as they move past you.

You suspect that you are being avoided, as the dark, flitting shapes you saw from beyond the path have now gone. You share the path with only automated droids, which clank heavily along the concrete as they move past you. A shorter path branches off to the east, while the main path continues to the southwest.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go east, southwest, and west.

02:36:57 [Artificial Cavern; Dead End]

02:36:57 You can go west.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:37:00 [Artificial Cavern; Dead End]

02:37:00 You guess that this short path is somewhere in the center of this small cavern city. You are still being avoided by the cavern's inhabitants, with a single exception: a large metal door is slightly ajar, and is the only open door in sight.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go west.

02:37:08 [Cavern City; Weapons and Armor Shop]

02:37:08 You see a trash bin here.

02:39:54 [Cavern City; Weapons and Armor Shop]

02:39:54 You look about uneasily as the shop's owner, one of the small, dark cavern inhabitants, glares at you from behind a counter. Various bits of stun armor and illegal-looking weapons are scattered haphazardly about the shop. You feel inclined to either make a purchase or quickly leave.
You see a trash bin here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go out.

02:40:46 Lileah Rose gives you a stun power cartridge storage container.

02:51:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You will likely find unregs quite interesting when you meet them.. They're um.. different for sure. We alliance folks could probably learn a lot from the way they live."

02:52:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And just like any group of people, there's good ones, and bad ones."

02:52:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "They seem to enjoy duct tape and bolts."

02:52:36 The suborbital pod reaches the top of its arc, coming to a gradual stop before beginning to plummet back to the surface.

You can go out and into the ship.
Lileah Rose followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:54:54 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

02:54:55 You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.
Lileah Rose followed you.

02:54:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, right on. Yeah, probably won't be able to do that. Though you could put your scoop on someone elses transport and have them take you. We pilots won't be banned from their space or anything, our ships just won't be able to enter the skims."

02:55:06 Lileah Rose says to you, "there is a very nice mall here if you need to do any shopping sometime."

02:55:08 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Eh?"

02:55:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's that?"

02:55:13 You say, "Ah, ok"

02:55:16 You smile.

02:55:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Couriering."

02:55:36 Lileah Rose says, "just go south on thar road south of Sea view and go into the mall"

02:55:51 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

02:55:55 You smile.

02:55:56 You say, "ok"

02:56:01 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's that? Come blow up your courier ship?"

02:56:09 Lileah Rose sits down on a large leather lounge couch.

02:56:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

02:56:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Don't you dare. It's all shiny and new."

02:56:13 You sit down on a large leather lounge couch.

02:56:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh! Did you do the thing?"

02:56:31 Lileah Rose says, "your call Love I'll ride along"

02:56:33 Lileah Rose grins.

02:56:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I did the thing."

02:56:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, well than I couldn't do it anyways."

02:56:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cackles!

02:57:04 You grin.

02:57:07 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:57:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

02:57:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:57:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Transport all the things!"

02:57:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:57:25 There is nothing in the storage hold.

02:57:25 Storage capacity: 200000 units

02:57:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All of them!"

02:57:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:57:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:57:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:57:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:57:47 Lileah Rose says, "don't be afraid I forgot to look closer at the cannon"

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:49:45 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:49:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:49:47 You say, "crap"

03:49:51 You say, "it's still here."

03:49:52 Targets in this sector:

03:49:52 
[1] Battleship 451 (IFS)
[2] Debris at 14 units

Scan which target?
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:49:52 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as another starship is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

03:50:04 I don't understand that.

03:50:06 Lileah Rose says, "hopefully we'll make it"

03:50:10 You nod.

03:50:20 Lileah Rose presses some buttons on the sensor control board.

03:50:20 A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as another starship is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:

03:50:26 Lileah Rose says, "ugh"

03:50:32 You say, "uh oh"

03:50:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:50:35 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']
Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:50:37 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

03:50:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:50:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
Lileah Rose says, "thank the stars"

03:50:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:51:09 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

03:51:12 You exclaim, "No kidding!"

Enter the number of the object you would like to transfer.

03:51:18 Lileah Rose laughs.

03:51:19 You hear metallic scraping as the transfer of the cargo begins.

03:52:02 The sounds from the ship's hold cease as the cargo finishes transferring.

03:52:02 You have been credited with 1704958.78 AEU credits for your find.

03:52:10 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

03:52:10 Current overall point level: 157
Current combat point level: 0

03:52:26 You say, "I wish we could go fight that ship up there."

03:52:33 You say, "it's been there for a while."

03:52:35 There are 2 players connected:

03:52:35 Lileah Rose  (A)          Rolando Caganda  (A)       

03:52:35 Lileah Rose says, "me too"

03:52:44 Lileah Rose says, "it's really powerful though"

03:53:10 You say, "Yeah, I don't doubt that. It says battleship when I scan it..."

03:53:19 You exclaim, "That sounds powerful!"

03:53:32 Lileah Rose says, "it took out the FTL in the Journeyer in one hit"

03:53:37 You exclaim, "wow!"

03:53:41 Lileah Rose says, "yeah"

03:53:54 Lileah Rose says, "I was jumping out and I am so glad I had a temp drive installed"

03:54:15 You exclaim, "And I have no combat flying experience so... I'm certainly not going to be any help!"

03:54:28 You say, "I'm glad you had a temp drive too"

03:54:37 Lileah Rose says, "well mine has only been as a gunner and as an engineer so far."

03:54:48 Lileah Rose says, "and I'm not even the best gunner"

03:54:51 Lileah Rose laughs.

03:55:01 You say, "Well, I'm sure you're better than me."

03:55:18 Lileah Rose says, "who knows. I was never the most coordinated human."

03:56:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's everybody?"

03:56:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm alright."

03:56:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Doing alright, I suppose."

03:57:05 Say to whom?

03:57:08 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

03:57:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well.. as well as I can be when salvaging."

03:57:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I spent the whole day combing the debris field but I got all the artifacts for 300 exploration finally."

03:57:37 You say, "Well, you have to have some coordination. You're a starship pilot."

03:58:05 Lileah Rose says, "well I'm more of an explorer type. I think I barely passed combat training"

03:58:16 Lileah Rose says, "I love the stars"

03:58:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I feel like that I am about to be in an argument with the government over the proposal. We shall see what they say."

03:58:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Have they responded at all yet?"

03:59:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No."

03:59:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do they argue with you about this kind of stuff? I would have expected them to just be like 'Okay, noted.'"

03:59:18 You grin at Lileah Rose.

03:59:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 1,832,812.50 credits from a xenology submission.

04:00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Opinions get ignored more than argued with sometimes."

04:00:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You might not hear back from them tonight. The folks at the terminal have to go and inform someone else, who likely has to inform someone else and so forth. And then it makes it's way back ot the liaison office."

04:00:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not sure how many steps are involved. But I know it's a process."

04:01:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah ha, good Rats killing, Dak."

04:01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hmm?"

04:02:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just stamped a report of you wiping out a bunch of Rats."

04:02:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good job."

04:02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cheers.

04:02:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh. I suppose I was pretty busy with them. Thanks!"

04:02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eli, I'd like to discuss something with you and constantine."

04:03:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "If you two can spare a moment."

04:03:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure."

04:03:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Arlight, Ineed to get my ship. But I'll be right there."

04:03:36 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

04:04:03 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

04:04:08 Lileah Rose squeezes you affectionately.

04:06:20 You say, "ok, I think it's time for me to wind down for the day."

04:06:23 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:06:23 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:06:26 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

04:06:28 Lileah Rose stands up.

04:06:31 You stand up.

04:06:34 You hold Lileah Rose's hand, taking her into your group.

04:06:38 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Airlock]

04:06:39 You can go out and into the ship.

04:06:46 You can't go that way.

04:06:49 You sit down on a lavender tapestry sectional sofa.

04:07:02 Lileah Rose asks, "wow did you look out there?"

04:07:07 You peer out...

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water. Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the Spaceport.

You can go north, west, and down.

04:07:42 You say, "Yeah, I did."

04:07:52 Lileah Rose says, "wow that battlecruiser"

04:08:04 Lileah Rose says, "I've never seen it before"

04:08:21 Lileah Rose sits down on a lavender tapestry sectional sofa.

04:08:35 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

04:08:55 Lileah Rose says, "I have only seen one or two battlecruisers over here."

04:10:19 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

04:10:34 You say, "Yeah, I hadn't seen it before either."

04:10:52 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

04:12:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person light transport "Procyon". The organization has earned 409,151.27 credits.

04:15:50 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

04:25:52 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:31:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "So.. not very threatening."

04:31:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok. I'm on it."

04:31:16 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:31:16 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:31:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:31:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:31:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:31:25 The ship is already moving.

04:31:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:31:33 Which sector did you mean?

04:31:34 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

04:31:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:31:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:31:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

04:31:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:31:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:31:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:31:43 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: m`xcR{eEM7"dNf52J#m<i9cg7-y"+d;K5vH(y1~P
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:31:44 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

04:31:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:31:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:31:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:31:48 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:31:49 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

04:31:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:31:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:31:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:31:53 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:31:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

04:31:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:31:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:31:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:31:58 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
The computer reports that the two-person bolt thrower "Redemption" has jumped out of the sector.
The computer reports that the reconnaissance craft "Is This A Dagger Which I See Before Me?" has jumped out of the sector.

04:32:01 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

04:32:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Orion clear."

04:32:22 The wormhole drive is unable to draw enough zero-point energy for a jump.  An interdiction field is suspected.

04:32:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "They really are quick to jump out when you get there."

04:32:29 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (13, 11, 4)

04:32:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:32:33 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

04:32:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:08:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Mutuality headline says that area pilot invented canned beer."

11:08:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or maybe it doesn't say pilot."

11:08:55 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They could have been given the secret formula by a hard-drinking area pilot though."

11:09:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sleepy. I don't know what I'm saying. I said canned bear a minute ago for crying out loud."

11:09:03 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We really have no way of knowing."

15:54:59 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:54:59 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:55:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:55:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:56:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:56:11 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

15:56:16 You glance at your communicator's screen.

15:56:16 There is one headline.

15:56:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:56:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:56:21 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

15:56:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:56:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:56:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:12:01 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:12:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:12:04 You peer out...

17:12:04 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be a sight to behold."

17:12:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

17:12:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:12:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If we can learn secrets of the pysics-breaking spherical cube, surely our power would be limitless."

17:12:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:12:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You sare a spherical cube, eli."

17:12:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. physics-breaking."

Enter your selection:

17:12:56 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:12:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:12:56 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

17:13:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:13:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:13:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:13:03 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:13:04 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

17:13:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

17:13:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:13:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:13:08 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:13:11 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

17:13:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:13:45 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

17:13:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

17:13:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:14:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:14:05 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:18:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The first time I brought back a cluster of those organic-looking spheres, I was so worried the researchers were just going to say "Uh... sir? these are just alien turds.""

17:18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey Shule."

17:42:46 [Starship "Flying Cat"; Control Room]

17:42:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

17:44:13 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:44:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:44:14 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:44:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:44:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:44:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:45:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:45:00 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

22:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:01 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

22:14:37 Not much to see out there.

22:14:40 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:14:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:14:42 You peer out...

22:14:42 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

22:14:45 I don't understand that.

22:14:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:14:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:14:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:15:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:15:04 Which sector did you mean?

22:15:04 
[1] Tandem Territories (Mutuality)
[2] Tandem Station (Mutuality)

22:15:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Tandem Station. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:15:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:15:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

22:15:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:15:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:15:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:15:13 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:15:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:15:24 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station "Tandem" (Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:15:27 Via general sector communication, Space Station "Tandem" transmits, "Firestorm, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:15:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Space Station "Tandem" (Alpha).

22:15:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:16:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:16:16 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:16:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Greetings, Firestorm. The Mutuality welcome you to this free port."

22:16:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:16:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:16:36 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:16:36 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:16:59 [Space Station "Tandem"; Accessway]

22:16:59 You can go north, east, south, west, and up.

22:17:01 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:01 You can go north, south, west, and down.

22:17:05 List what?

22:17:06 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:06 You can go northeast and south.

22:17:08 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:17:08 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:09 Along this twenty-meter-long section of curving corridor are several doorways, each set into a shallow alcove with a keypad beside it. In the dim but steady light, you can see a metal plaque on one of the doorways, reading, 'Damage Control.' Visitors wandering into this area usually get a stern look from station personnel passing by, while familiar faces get a nod of recognition. It is quiet here, footsteps muffled by the thin dark gray carpet.
You can go northeast and south.

22:17:21 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:21 You can go northeast and southwest.

22:17:22 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:22 Smoothly curved and polished metal girders protrude slightly from the finished walls here, almost decorative in their spacing along the corridor and in the semicircular wheel-like brace overhead where the girders meet. The light is dim but steady, provided by tall glowing panels that match the curvature of the walls. Along the corridor are several doorways set into shallow alcoves, one identified as 'Trade Licensing and Certification,' though entrance into that area requires a code unlikely to be known by civilian pilots.
You can go northeast and southwest.

22:17:36 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:36 You can go east and southwest.

22:17:37 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:37 This long corridor is quiet, footstep muffled by the thin gray carpet covering the metal floor. The walls curve smoothly into an arch overhead, with polished steel girders protruding slightly from them and meeting at the apex of the ceiling with a semicircular wheel-like brace. Between two shadowed doorways here is a laminated notice of the corridor being closed for maintenance in what might be the near future.
You can go east and southwest.

22:17:49 You can't go that way.

22:17:50 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:50 You can go east and west.

22:17:51 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:17:51 Here at the north point of the outring, dimly lit corridors extend to the east and west, curving around the station with geometrically precise construction. On the north side of the corridor is a security station with mirrored windows set around the heavily secured doorway, and opposite the security station is a wide hatch leading south into a spacious, well-lit corridor.
You can go east and west.

22:18:03 [Space Station "Tandem"; Crossway]

22:18:03 You can go south and out.

22:18:04 [Space Station "Tandem"; Crossway]

22:18:05 A few advertisements for shops elsewhere in the station have been affixed to the walls of this part of the crossway, but the light is dimmer here than elsewhere and few people venture by. On the north end of the corridor, a wide hatch leads out into the outring. From here you can see through the hatch to the lights of one of the station's main security offices, this one located at the north point of the ring. Toward the south is the station's hub, its light and noise a marked contrast to this quiet corridor.
You can go south and out.

22:18:13 [Space Station "Tandem"; Crossway]

22:18:13 You can go north, east, south, and west.

22:18:15 [Space Station "Tandem"; Crossway]

22:18:15 This corridor is wide but relatively quiet. Traders are rarely seen in this part of the station, but shoppers come, instead, to browse the shelves of the two shops located here. On the west side, in an alcove framed by potted ferns bolted to the floor, is the doorway to a store where hydroponically grown plants are sold, and on the east side is a container shop, its doorway decorated with rows of bags firmly glued to a display stand. The station hub is to the south, and toward the north is the exit of the crossway to the station's outer ring.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

22:18:30 [Space Station "Tandem"; Crossway]

22:18:30 You can go south and out.

22:18:32 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:18:32 You can go east and west.

22:18:33 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:18:33 You can go southeast and west.

22:18:34 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:18:34 This curving section of the Outring measures perhaps ten meters wide and twenty meters long. Arched alcoves along the corridor contain doorways leading to station facilities. In the dim but steady light provided by the tall glowing panels recessed into the walls, you can see that the metal plaque beside one doorway reads: 'Electronics Fabrication.' Beside it are instructions for general deliveries to the shop.
You can go southeast and west.

22:18:46 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:18:46 You can go southeast and northwest.

22:18:47 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:18:47 Curved metal girders, polished and reflecting the glow of the lighted panels along the pale gray walls, brace the ceiling of the long corridor here. Underfoot is a thin gray carpet, worn in a few places, but dampening the sounds of footsteps of passersby. Set into an alcove here is a doorway to an office of the Free Port Authority, though it appears to be locked at the moment.
You can go southeast and northwest.

22:18:57 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:18:57 You can go south and northwest.

22:18:58 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:18:58 Down this long, curving section of the outring, girders protrude from the walls at regular intervals, the lengths of polished metal matching the curvature of the walls and meeting perhaps six meters overhead in a semicircular wheel-like brace. Between the girders are alcoves containing doorways marked as various station offices. One of the doorways here has a metal sign bolted to it, reading, 'Personnel,' and some of the traffic in this area consists of station workers coming to read the notices mounted to a board beside the doorway.
You can go south and northwest.

22:19:12 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:19:12 You can go north, east, south, and down.

22:19:13 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:19:13 This intersection of corridors is about ten meters across and twice as long to the north and south, the pale gray walls curving smoothly into an arched ceiling. The walls are smudged in places with oil and grease, and between the curved girders that support them are several stacks of plastic-covered crates. On the west side of the area is a wide, open hatch leading into a spacious, well-lit corridor extending toward the station's central hub, while smaller hatches to the north and south allow access to the outring around the station. The sounds of ships landing and launching occasionally come from the corridor leading east from here. Additionally, built into the wall on the northeast side of the area, is circular stairway leading downward to a lower level of the station.
You can go north, east, south, and down.

22:19:30 [Space Station "Tandem"; Accessway]

22:19:31 You can go north, east, south, and west.

22:19:32 [Space Station "Tandem"; Trading Center]

22:19:32 You can go north.

22:19:33 [Space Station "Tandem"; Trading Center]

22:19:34 A lighted board over the counter here details the ever-changing prices of commodities bought and sold at the station. Traders come in and out, sometimes pausing to stare at the board a few moments before quietly approaching the clerks behind the counter to arrange the transfer of trade items.
You can go north.

22:19:37 [Space Station "Tandem"; Accessway]

22:19:37 You can go north, east, south, and west.

22:19:38 [Space Station "Tandem"; Mail Center]

22:19:38 You see a trash can here.
You can go south.

22:19:39 [Space Station "Tandem"; Mail Center]

22:19:39 Mail from everywhere in human-occupied space, even the farthest reaches of Mutuality territory, finds its way here to Tandem's largely automated mail center. Above the belts that convey packages and mail to and from the back of the mail room, a menu board relates prices for letters and packages. A handwritten note beneath encourages pilots to request a load of mail to deliver themselves.
You see a trash can here.
You can go south.

22:19:40 [Space Station "Tandem"; Accessway]

22:19:40 You can go north, east, south, and west.

22:19:41 [Space Station "Tandem"; Docking Bay Beta]

22:19:41 You see an automatic teller machine, Lump the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go west and down.

22:19:46 [Space Station "Tandem"; Accessway]

22:19:46 You can go north, east, south, and west.

22:19:46 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:19:47 You can go north, east, south, and down.

22:19:48 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:19:48 You can go north and southwest.

22:19:50 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:19:50 This corridor is much like a tunnel, though a clean one. The walls are smooth and pale gray, braced with polished metal girders that meet at the apex of the arched ceiling in a semicircular wheel-like construct, and the floor is covered with a dark carpet that has worn a bit thin in places. Inside alcoves along the corridor are several doorways, among them a damage control station with an emergency exit map beside it.
You can go north and southwest.

22:20:02 You can't go that way.

22:20:04 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:04 You can go northeast and southwest.

22:20:05 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:05 The doorways into several offices, all of them unmarked, are set into alcoves along this curving corridor. Next to one of them is a small black rectangular panel that appears to be inoperative at the moment. Though the air is cool, warm air constantly circulates upward from vents near the floor, alleviating the deep cold of space just beyond the confines of the station.
You can go northeast and southwest.

22:20:16 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:16 You can go northeast and west.

22:20:17 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:17 Every doorway set into the alcoves along this section of corridor has a plaque on it, reading: 'Private.' People occasionally come along, but no one seems to ever enter or come out of these doorways.
You can go northeast and west.

22:20:25 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:25 You can go east and west.

22:20:25 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:26 This long, curving corridor is dimly lit, but through a hatch on the north side, a bright spacious corridor extends toward the center of the station. Beside the hatch is a faded sign warning of the dangers of sudden decompression. Opposite the hatch, along the south side of the corridor, is a security office with mirrored windows set around its heavily secured doorway.
You can go east and west.

22:20:28 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:39 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:39 You can go east and northwest.

22:20:40 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:20:40 Along this section of the corridor are several doorways set into alcoves. Among the doorways is one labeled by a plaque outside as the Tandem Pact Trade Coordination Office. Beneath the name on the plaque is the Pact logo, a four-pointed star superimposed over an open circle.
You can go east and northwest.

22:21:04 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:21:04 You can go southeast and northwest.

22:21:07 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:21:07 Lighted panels recessed into the walls along this long, curving corridor provide a dim but steady illumination, the light glimmering off polished metal girders protruding from the walls and following their curvature upward to the smoothly arched ceiling where they meet in a semicircular wheel-like brace. Among the doors inset into shallow alcoves here is the Office of Trade Rates Coordination and Arbitration.
You can go southeast and northwest.

22:21:18 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:21:18 You can go north and southeast.

22:21:19 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:21:19 Along this long, curving corridor are several doorways recessed into shallow alcoves, among them the Trade and Tax Regulation Office. It is not unusual to see weary and sometimes exasperated traders lined up in the hallway near the office, awaiting their turn inside.
You can go north and southeast.

22:22:06 [Space Station "Tandem"; Throughway]

22:22:07 Polished steel girders brace the walls here, meeting overhead in the arch of the ceiling where a red and black Mutuality banner hangs, the fabric stirring slightly in the warm air wafting up from the ventilation system beneath the floor. Along this section of corridor, a wide doorway opens south to Tandem's taxi station, though some sort of construction is taking place there and, as a result, the facility is not open for business. Another open entrance leads north into a general clothing store advertised by a rack of attractive clothing standing just outside the recessed doorway.
You can go north, east, and west.

22:22:19 [Space Station "Tandem"; Throughway]

22:22:19 You can go east and west.

22:22:20 [Space Station "Tandem"; Throughway]

22:22:21 The center of the floor here has been left uncarpeted, allowing air to circulate upward from the ventilation system that runs beneath the floor, the warm air rippling the Mutuality banner hanging from the polished girders that meet at the apex of the arched ceiling overhead. Traders, visitors, and station residents move easily through the corridor, though a long line often forms at the kiosk of a taco vendor here, the aroma of freshly cooked food too tempting to resist. Just to the west is the station's hub, noisy and brightly lit.
You can go east and west.

22:22:33 [Space Station "Tandem"; Hub]

22:22:33 You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, and down.

22:22:37 [Space Station "Tandem"; Hub]

22:22:37 Perhaps twenty meters in diameter, the hub of the station is a bustling, brightly lit place. Popular businesses are accorded space here, including a crowded restaurant, a rather seedy bar, and a gaudy souvenir shop. In addition to the shoppers milling about, traders and travelers gather in small groups around a wide circular stairway in the middle of the hub. Apart from them are station residents, known by their relaxed manner and dress. Around the perimeter of the hub are wide corridors leading north, south, east, and west to other parts of the station.

22:22:55 You peer southeast...

22:22:55 
[Space Station "Tandem"; Spacers]
Tinny popular music plays in the background of this crowded little restaurant. The light is bright, and the floor looks clean. Though people mill about somewhat chaotically, crowding around the long counter near the back to place their orders and jostling each other as they find seating on the benches pulled up to the two long black plastic tables in the center of the room, the air here seems oxygen-rich, probably due to the long black planters along the walls, each one overflowing with green ferns and leafy plants.
You see a trash can here.
You can go northwest.

22:22:58 You peer northeast...

22:22:58 
[Space Station "Tandem"; Souvenirs]
Crammed onto every available inch of shelf space here are inexpensive souvenirs, some of them useful, most not. Banners and flags hang from the ceiling, and at the end of each aisle is a bin of stuffed toys. A small clothing section adds to the capitalist ambiance, as souvenir t-shirts and underwear are snatched up nearly as soon as they are restocked.
You see a trash can here.
You can go southwest.

22:23:01 You peer northwest...

22:23:01 
[Space Station "Tandem"; Shipsuits]
Hanging from clothing racks arranged into aisles down the middle of this popular shop are numerous styles of shipsuits, all constructed of the cheap but durable synthetic fabrics so common among spacers. Though Mutuality colors predominate, a good selection of other colors are also on display.
You see a trash can here.
You can go southeast.

22:23:04 You peer southwest...

22:23:04 
[Space Station "Tandem"; Bright's Bar]
Smelling of roasted peanuts and spilled beer, with a long bar near the back surrounded by padded bar stools, and dented metal tables placed here and there across the center of the room, this dimly lit establishment resembles crowded, shabby bars anywhere. It is distinguished, however, by the rare collection of neon shapes on the walls that cast oddly colored lights on the faces of its clientele, and the assortment of spacer-beloved beverages on the menu. You see a very large black jersey labeled 'JUPITER CRASH' hanging on a wall.
You see a battered holovid, a trash can, and a dark red and black payshoes interface here.
You can go northeast.

22:24:05 [Space Station "Tandem"; Throughway]

22:24:05 Two shops occupy space along this section of corridor. On the north side, a shop called Fluidity advertises water and water-related wares with big balloon-like bubbles hanging around the sign over the doorway, and on the south side is a fabulously popular gelatin store decorated with a rainbow-hued sign, reading, "Gelatin Supply! All Colors! Get them NOW!.' It's not unusual to see spacers wheeling away whole cases of the stuff from there. Down toward the east is the brightly lit central hub of the station.

22:24:40 [Space Station "Tandem"; Grand Conference Room]

22:24:40 Numerous long, narrow windows of transparisteel framed in black give this circular conference room a view that can be found nowhere else on the station. Though you can see little but distant stars through the windows, starships can occasionally be observed moving through nearby space to dock at the station. In the center of the room, decorated in black, red, and gunmetal gray, is a large round table of ebony steel with the symbol of the Tandem Pact engraved in the middle. Comfortably padded black chairs surround the large table, and overhead is a round ring of lights that shed a soft illumination over the room.

22:25:15 You can go north, east, west, and up.

22:25:16 [Space Station "Tandem"; Lower Hub]

22:25:17 Lit by regularly spaced panels recessed into the walls, this area is circular, with a winding staircase in the center of it leading up to a higher level of the station, where it is always brighter and noisier than here. The same staircase has a downward extension, but it is blocked by a metal grate with a sign on it. To the east and west are long corridors, and to the north is a quiet area, its arched entrance framed with a slender, smoothly curved water panel, the small bubbles inside continually generated and rising upward to the apex of the arch.

22:27:05 The ship is already moving.

22:27:11 The ship is already moving.

22:27:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:27:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:27:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:27:16 The starship is already moving.

22:27:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:27:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:27:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:27:20 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

22:28:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:28:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:28:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:28:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:28:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:28:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:28:51 Huge walls of windows line this semicircular station room. Travelers mill about, watching the large display boards suspended from the high ceiling, and new arrivals stream out toward the reception area. Pods arrive and leave through a broad circular opening in the ceiling, landing with superb precision on a central platform. Broad steps lead up to the passenger loading area, where a white-gloved attendant directs traffic. To the west, you can see the nearly identical AEU Circuit station through a tall archway.
You can go west and northwest.

22:28:59 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:30:46 A display indicates that ITPN Main Circuit Pod One is due to arrive within seconds.

22:31:32 List what?

22:31:34 I don't understand that.

22:31:36 [ITPN Main Circuit Pod One]

22:31:36 This transport pod is spheroid, with a broad band of transparent plasteel around its center. Several rows of seats line the inner edge, and each seat is equipped with a bit of rubberized webbing to secure its passenger. Small displays next to each seat provide the ROUTE for this pod, with the current destination always at the top of the list. A chromed ring of tubular plasteel is mounted to the ceiling, with a number of hand grips dangling from it for those who choose to remain standing. Soft carpeting in a subtle blue and black ripple pattern covers the floor.

22:37:03 You peer down...

22:37:04 
[Space Station "Tandem"; Accessway]
In this long corridor, polished metal girders matching the curvature of the pale gray walls arc overhead, except on the far wall where a set of stairs leading up to the ITPN Station has been built along the outer bulkhead. Tall lighted panels are recessed into the walls, and the metal mesh of the floor allows warm air to circulate upward from the ventilation system beneath. Beyond a wide hatch to the north, technicians and mechanics can be seen rushing around in the station's Repair and Rearm facility, while the starship supply store to the south seems relatively quiet with several large unopened crates stacked beside the hatch there. To the west is another wide hatch leading to a cavernous space that can only be one of the station's docking bays.

22:37:23 [Space Station "Tandem"; Outring]

22:37:23 About ten meters across and twice as long to the north and south, this section of smoothly finished gray corridor curves slightly as part of the outer ring of the station, commonly called the Outring. Polished metal girders protrude from the walls, which arch gradually to meet overhead. Though the light here is never bright, the tall glowing panels recessed into the walls provide a steady illumination. On the east side of this area is a wide, open hatch leading into a spacious corridor extending toward the center of the station. Smaller hatches follow the outring around the station to the north and south, and the sounds of ships landing and launching often comes from the corridor leading west from here. In one corner of the intersection, a narrow circular set of stairs leads down to a lower level.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

22:38:29 This intersection of corridors is about ten meters across and twice as long to the north and south, the pale gray walls curving smoothly into an arched ceiling. The walls are smudged in places with oil and grease, and between the curved girders that support them are several stacks of plastic-covered crates. On the west side of the area is a wide, open hatch leading into a spacious, well-lit corridor extending toward the station's central hub, while smaller hatches to the north and south allow access to the outring around the station. The sounds of ships landing and launching occasionally come from the corridor leading east from here.
