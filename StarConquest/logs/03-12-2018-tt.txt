Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole
drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser

Subject: Our ridiculous lives
Author: Constantine Stone
Posted: 18:57 13 March 2318 GST

Pilots,
 
I won't be at the meeting Saturday, so I thought I'd jot some things down about
the current predicament we're in for people to think about. At the recent League
meeting Kim and I attended, a couple things were made clear to me:
 
1. The League pilots voted twice to not allow us on their ships and not crew on
our ships. Any League pilot who does these things in spite of the vote is seen
as a scab breaking a strike.
 
2. The League is really pissed off about Best saying that the citizens of the
Mutuality aren't human.
 
3. Many of the League pilots feel that we don't do enough to oppose Best, and
that we either embrace him or tacitly enable him.
 
You'll notice I wrote nothing about stations, because I don't really care about
stations. There are maybe 6 of us that are active, and among those 6 the number
of pilots who actually need the extra money from stations is probably 0-1. I
don't think we should make any decisions based on our inclusion on stations.
 
That said, if I could correct some of these things, I would. In a perfect world,
we would still be in the Accord, but that ship has sailed and isn't coming back.
Personally, I view the Steel Phoenix as being important to the Union's defense
now that the Accord doesn't provide that defense, so I have no problem
supporting it. Some League pilots have expressed views suggesting to me that
they believe the Steel Phoenix is some kind of threat to unregs. This seems
idiotic and nonsensical to me, but we don't really talk about these things -- if
any of you feel like we're wrong to support the Steel Phoenix, I'd like to hear
about it. 
 
Also in a perfect world, Best wouldn't make disparaging, inflammatory comments
about people he hasn't met, or persecute unregs in general. This is something we
have no control over -- my view is that we voted him into office, this was a
mistake, and we'll likely have to live with it for the next three years (barring
events outside of our control -- Hyperion voter registration ledger, anyone?
what happened to that news story, and where are the ledgers?).
 
I'll admit I've done nothing to oppose Best lately. Since the crashes last year,
I've been working hard on earning the money to pay off the debt I owe to New
Phoenix, and not on much else. I also personally feel that while Best has said
and done things that are distasteful to me, I've done worse things. It isn't
just me, though. My perception is that none of us are doing anything to oppose
Best currently. I get that there aren't many of us and we have varying levels of
activity; I understand this, but I doubt these things mitigate the perception
that we don't care or actively support the government.
 
So what's to be done? If I were writing a wish list, I'd wish for Best to place
some percentage of Steel Phoenix forces at the disposal of the Accord, as a way
of contributing a token force to the common defense of humanity without giving
the Accord control over all our defense spending. I'd also wish for Best to drop
his persecution of unregs and stop trying to deport the ones within Union space
(did that ever happen? another news story that disintegrated). These things
probably won't happen, though, as the government never listens to us and
apparently has no incentive to.
 
Interestingly, at this recent meeting, a few league pilots expressed interest in
meeting with us to come up with peaceful and legal (I stress) ways to oppose the
administration. I thought this was interesting because in the past none of them
have shown any interest in helping us (and indeed, many of them still do not). I
don't know how fruitful such a meeting would be, however, as I think we've well
established that protests and strikes coming from six guys are pretty toothless.
I have mixed feelings about attending a meeting like this. I think it's
encouraging that other people want to help, but don't forget that fixing point 3
in my above list will never do anything about point 2. The League takes its cues
from the Mutuality for whatever reason, and likely won't amend relations with us
while our government openly persecutes unregs.
 
So those are my thoughts on the current political climate. I'm sorry I'll miss
the meeting. If anyone has thoughts about these things, please post them, I'd
love to read them.
 
To the government stooges reading this, come at me, I guess. I think we're way
past hiding our displeasure.

Greetings,
First, please keep any and all messages and exchanges over the AEU Channels we
engage in which pertains to the AEU as confidential. I do not want anything I am
about to share to be exchanged with anyone who is not an AEU pilot. Thank you
for respecting this request as well/
I am not certain that I will be available to attend the meeting Saturday,
however, I will if possible.
Here are my own responses to Constantine's statements along with my own
thoughts.
While I did want to attend the meeting yesterday, I couldn't for personal
reasons. Still, I didn't consider that it would yield much progress because you
see, the League are the true separatists in all of this. If they truly wanted to
protest what the AEU Government is doing along with what they mis-perceive that
AEU pilots are not doing, then they would engage with us.
Constantine states:  1. The League pilots voted twice to not allow us on their
ships and not crew on our ships. Any League pilot who does these things in spite
of the vote is seen as a scab breaking a strike.
I already knew about the League's unwillingness to work with AEU pilots who they
want to punish rather than our government. Yet the League believes it's ok to
allow the Merry Band to pervade known space. Until recently, they didn't seem to
take issue with another Alliance's government whose government is a dictatorship
so it's rather hypocritical. but it goes without saying that they aren't
following a very rational line here.
You see, if they truly wanted to punish the AEU government, they would give us
cause to earn their currency and increase the proffitability of other Alliances
rather than for us to independently engage in our own enterprise. So herein is a
contradiction of rationale on the part of League pilots.
next Constantine states:  2. The League is really pissed off about Best saying
that the citizens of the Mutuality aren't human.
I agree with the League on this aspect and it is perfectly clear that none of us
agree on this point as I have considered Mutuality to be as human as anyone.
So thereagain, the League just want to drum up excuses to point fingers ... to
hold us accountable for what we absolutely cannot control.
Constantine then states:  3. Many of the League pilots feel that we don't do
enough to oppose Best, and that we either embrace him or tacitly enable him.
We protested, I am not a Phoenix Dissident for tacidly agreeing with the AEU
Government either. I personally paid for Message beacons expressing my own
opposition to Outcord. I attended the meeting across the Skim to attempt to
negotiate our assurance that we would demand of the AEU government that they
would agree not to attack the Mutuality nor invade their space again.
Consequently, no conflicts have occurred since the initial incident. Here's just
another childish and mis-conceived justification on the part of the League to
blame us merely because of their typical 'because we can' mentality.
Notwithstanding that I am certain that all of us would not support any attacks
on the Mutuality if they were to ever reoccur. I for one do feel a huge sense of
frustration and I reluctantly concede to feeling more powerless than I want to
ever admit. I'm still willing to do whatever it takes though to do what we can
but a handful of us can't effect the necessary changes. It takes more than a
handful of pilots who citizens disrespect in the first place, to cause the
necessary level of force to effect change.
Concerning Temporary Space stations, I disagree with Constantine and I would say
that this is likely due to his lack of personal experiences and knowledge
concerning Temporary Space Stations which isn't any fault of his. we need them
but we don't need to participate with other Alliances with the exception that
Cats can buy all of the highest Temporary Space Station Modules. However, there
was a time when all organizations couldn't and they put together the best
possible station configurations with what they were capable to provide. Everyone
grew and survived quite nicely. We shall manage very well without the best that
Credits can buy. We need these stations to maintain funds in our organizations
particularly to support Cruisers for defending not only humanity but perhaps our
own lot. We need stations to support our newer pilots so that they can earn a
bit more from their work to enable them to grow their own financial resources so
that they will become more empowered and able to work with us and our allies.
Stations also do detractfrom the AEU government merely because very little of
the income generated is realized by the AEU government. So if we had no
stations, when we performed work where the income received is paid out directly
through a Spaceport, Artifact Research facility, for Beacon drops not sponsored
by a Battle Scanner and so on, the AEU government profits by taking out a
significant portion in taxes which isn't the case through the utilization of
Temporary Space Stations. Therefore, if I didn't have two Cruisers to support
along with other Combat-ready Starships and the ability to support up to 4
Cruisers currently, through SEAS, I would still support the continued operation
of income producing Temporary Space Stations as a measure to deflect income from
the AEU government itself. Additionally all funds retained in an organizations'
balance are in EAOS currency and not AEU currency.
I really don't personally earn much from Temporary Space Stations but there are
other aspects which I have described above which are of far greater benefit to
us as pilots and which are far-reaching towards our ability to support our
commitment to defend humanity.
I regret it that we could not continue to be a part of the Accord. That breech
is shameful which isn't a strong enough word to describe my true feelings.
Whenever I encounter peacekeepers, I always greet them and I have also freed
several from interdicters launched by the Merry Band and will continue to help
to defend them when the need arises
While i am not personally convinced that the Union through The Steel Phoenix
Command is capable of defending itself against the likely magnitude of Outsider
attacks and occupation experienced in the past, I will support it as it's all
that we have in our defense to the extent that it is.
The League's claim is another one of their baseless claims. There's no rational
evidence to support that Steel phoenix exists for any other purpose other than
to replace what was lost due to the breech with the Accord.
I am personally conflicted concerning renewed relations with the League. I
cannot and will not tolerate their willingness to allow pirate activity merely
to be able to selfishly gain for themselves in the way of more powerful
Exploration Technology. If we, notwithstanding the worst government we've ever
had, were to engage in any negotiations, as long as they support pirate
activity, I will absolutely not support any relations with the league in this
respect.
Having said what i have, I personally do want to get along with others from all
Alliances. I do not engage anyone in debates over these mattters and I am
willing to work alongside those who don't want to work with us purely because I
want to be respectful and behave in an amicable and professional manner. I would
ask that we all consider this approach regardless of our own inner conflict
about these issues as well.
I am not able to work as much as I once could so my time to independently wage
any sort of personal effort to resist the worst administration ever! is limited.
Still, I am willing to do whatever it takes with whatever I have. As for these
next three years, I certainly don't look forward to them. I am however skeptical
though, that any major seachange we could manage still will never be adequate
enough for some whose mind-set is 'because we can'.
Although I don't hold Unregs in the same regard as the AEU government, this
stems from prior to the current government. The old resentment of those who
severed their ties and departed with untold claims of large sums of resources is
somewhat legitimate I would surmise. However, the irony here is that we all are
descendants from those who were willing to depart from their countries back on
Old Earth albeit mush was supported through efforts to explore and to discover.
I personally believe that whatever those individuals who departed left with was
theirs and theirs alone to utilize in whichever manner they so chose. I will
always admire those with the spirit to explore and to take on adventure of any
magnitude. So, I personally respect and admire the spirit and courage of those
who are so-called Unregs. I abhor the statements made and I wish I could have
been present to go after whomever attacked Pierre and any of those present who
were treated in such a horrible manner. I don't believe violent actions are
acceptable or a productive means to prove any point except abject stupidity.
So what's to be done according to Constantine? I support his wish for Best to
place some percentage of Steel Phoenix forces at the disposal of the Accord, as
a way of contributing a token force to the common defense of humanity without
giving the Accord control over all our defense spending.
Unfortunately, this is highly unlikely given the desire or the ability for the
Union to effect competent negotiation to resolve differences. They will likely
never concede to work cooperatively with the Accord.
I demand! not just wish that Best ceases his persecution of unregs and stop
trying to deport the ones within Union space
As Constantine states, at this recent meeting, a few league pilots expressed
interest in meeting with us to come up with peaceful and legal (I stress) ways
to oppose the administration. This is certainly interesting because in the past
none of them have shown any interest in helping us (and indeed, many of them

dictate to them.
I agree too, The League takes its cues from the Mutuality for whatever reason,
and likely won't amend relations with us while our government openly persecutes
unregs.
I fore the most part, support Constantine's sentaments with the exceptions I
have cited. I am not certain that we can accomplish a lot in a meeting which we
all don't already agree upon. I'm not into politicking either as this is not the
time to try to seekout cudos for oneself.
I have never nor ever will hide my displeasure with the behavior and inhumane
actions of the AEU government. so if that is the perception of others who want
to pride themselves upon punishing the AEU, then they are seriously mistaken!

Lily Kaise

Greetings,
For what it's worth, I'll throw my two credits worth of thoughts in here as
well. As with Lily, please keep my thoughts and writings strictly within the
AEU.
Regarding the League's vote not to allow AEU pilots on League ships: I honestly
wonder what the point of that is. What is it exactly they wish to accomplish by
banning AEU pilots from their ships. Is it going to help us oppose Best? Of
course not. Is it going to not allow us to fly? Of course not. Is it going to
help defend humanity against the real enemy, namely the Outsiders? Of course
not. So, what is the purpose of such an action and what good do they expect to
come from it?
Personally, I believe it's just another way for them to create drama and exert
their power over other pilots. It's the League who controls what everyone else
does on temporary space stations and there was no mutual vote to elect them into
that office. They just assumed it as a matter of principle, because they could
and nobody opposed them.
Regarding Best's statements regarding unregs. It seems that AEU and Mutuality
have not had good relations for quite a number of years now. This is nothing new
and while I disagree one hundred percent with Best's statement, it is what he
said and not how the pilot corps feels as a whole. So, punishing the pilot
corps, being such a small body of people, for something that the government
said, isn't going to make a lot of difference either. Again, there's not any
good reason to do that except to fabricate excuses to stir up drama.
Third: many of us did protest Best and Outcoord and while I do not regret any
actions I took to take a stand against it, most of us felt powerless despite
everything we did. I know that some of the League pilots expressed that AEU
pilots should have just quit the pilot corps as a way to stand up against Best
and his actions. A couple of them even told me that they would have used
violence and would have happily gone to prison in protest to Best's
administration. Since September of last year, we have lost AEU pilots who chose
to protest by turning in their pilot's license. Has it honestly made a
difference? ?No, it has not. Violence was used as a way to protest the AEU
government, not by us pilots, but by others and yet it made no difference. 
So, League pilots think it's better to sacrifice one's career then be there to
help protect humanity? Really? Some of us had to work very hard and/or make big
sacrifices to be where we are as civilian pilots. I do not, nor would I suggest
anyone to, take resigning from the pilot corps as a trivial decision. It is one
that we should take very seriously. Despite my disagreements with the AEU
government, I signed up to be a civilian pilot in order to, among other things,
defend humanity.
*
Regarding temporary stations: I have disagreed with the way we've handled
temporary space stations for a while now. The League pilots have assumed control
over who participates on which stations. Perhaps I missed it, but when was the
vote that took place to put someone in charge? The League are supposed to be a
democracy and it seems they've voted on many issues, yet I somehow missed the
one in which we had an opportunity to vote who we wanted to be in charge of 
coordinating temporary space stations. In nearly the same breath that League
pilots told Lily that nobody reports to her except her organization members,
they said, "I'm going to wield the hammer of power and say ...". Again, why is
it ok for the League to "wield the hammer of power" and yet accuse us of trying
to take control? Seriously? Someone please enlighten me, because obviously I'm
missing something here.
Personally, I think temporary space stations help everyone and if we have to
build our own, we certainly can. It'd be nice to work with other people who will
work professionally and fair with everyone, but if that can't happen, then I
think we should do what we need to.

Obviously, I have my personal differences with pilots of other alliances, but in
all of this, one of the most important ideas to keep in mind is that the purpose
of the Accord and the different alliances is that we all have strengths and
weaknesses and we may not like the people flying with us and they may not like
us, but in the end, who's side are we on? If there is another major outsider
invasion, how is any of these disagreements and drama going to help protect the
ones we love and ultimately humanity? If the Outsiders were to attack us
tomorrow, they'd be attacking a people divided in strife and conflict. We as the
human race would be so much easier to conquer in such a turmoil state. All four
alliances have played their part and had their individual roles during the
resistance and in the fight against the Outsiders. So, who is the real enemy
here? Right now, I believe it's ourselves.
*

I have not been able to work very much as of late either due to reasons of my
own and I am more than willing to do what I can to help the alliance. However, I
protested against Outcoord, I have participated in various inter-alliance
activities, and I have performed my duties as a civilian pilot to the best of my
ability and I will continue to do those things. One thing I refuse to do is to
surrender my civilian pilot's license in protest of the AEU government. Pilot
resignations as a means of protest will only reinforce Best's actions and will
weaken the AEU civilian pilot corps even further.
I will do my best to be at the meeting, but I cannot guarantee I will be there.
So for what it's worth, those are my thoughts.

Subject: Re: Our ridiculous lives
--
Greetings,
For what it's worth, I'll throw my two credits worth of thoughts in here as
well. As with Lily, please keep my thoughts and writings strictly within the
AEU.
Regarding the League's vote not to allow AEU pilots on League ships: I honestly
wonder what the point of that is. What is it exactly they wish to accomplish by
banning AEU pilots from their ships. Is it going to help us oppose Best? Of
course not. Is it going to not allow us to fly? Of course not. Is it going to
help defend humanity against the real enemy, namely the Outsiders? Of course
not. So, what is the purpose of such an action and what good do they expect to
come from it?
Personally, I believe it's just another way for them to create drama and exert
their power over other pilots. It's the League who controls what everyone else
does on temporary space stations and there was no mutual vote to elect them into
that office. They just assumed it as a matter of principle, because they could
and nobody opposed them.
Regarding Best's statements regarding unregs. It seems that AEU and Mutuality
have not had good relations for quite a number of years now. This is nothing new
and while I disagree one hundred percent with Best's statement, it is what he
said and not how the pilot corps feels as a whole. So, punishing the pilot
corps, being such a small body of people, for something that the government
said, isn't going to make a lot of difference either. Again, there's not any
good reason to do that except to fabricate excuses to stir up drama.
Third: many of us did protest Best and Outcoord and while I do not regret any
actions I took to take a stand against it, most of us felt powerless despite
everything we did. I know that some of the League pilots expressed that AEU
pilots should have just quit the pilot corps as a way to stand up against Best
and his actions. A couple of them even told me that they would have used
violence and would have happily gone to prison in protest to Best's
administration. Since September of last year, we have lost AEU pilots who chose
to protest by turning in their pilot's license. Has it honestly made a
difference? ?No, it has not. Violence was used as a way to protest the AEU
government, not by us pilots, but by others and yet it made no difference. 
So, League pilots think it's better to sacrifice one's career then be there to
help protect humanity? Really? Some of us had to work very hard and/or make big
sacrifices to be where we are as civilian pilots. I do not, nor would I suggest
anyone to, take resigning from the pilot corps as a trivial decision. It is one
that we should take very seriously. Despite my disagreements with the AEU
government, I signed up to be a civilian pilot in order to, among other things,
defend humanity.
Regarding temporary stations: I have disagreed with the way we've handled
temporary space stations for a while now. The League pilots have assumed control
over who participates on which stations. Perhaps I missed it, but when was the
vote that took place to put someone in charge? The League are supposed to be a
democracy and it seems they've voted on many issues, yet I somehow missed the
one in which we had an opportunity to vote who we wanted to be in charge of 
coordinating temporary space stations. In nearly the same breath that League
pilots told Lily that nobody reports to her except her organization members,
they said, "I'm going to wield the hammer of power and say ...". Again, why is
it ok for the League to "wield the hammer of power" and yet accuse us of trying
to take control? Seriously? Someone please enlighten me, because obviously I'm
missing something here.
Personally, I think temporary space stations help everyone and if we have to
build our own, we certainly can. It'd be nice to work with other people who will
work professionally and fair with everyone, but if that can't happen, then I
think we should do what we need to.

needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the

control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I received a call from Melinda
Michaels from the League Alliance. She has reports that AEU pilots are hauling
their Asteroids to the other Asteroid processor which where no AEU organizations
are contributors in Alpha 285. Personally, I would consider it to be your own
decision as to whose Asteroid processing station you wish to haul to. However,
if you would prefer to earn AEU Currency and to give the AEU organizations
credit for the work performed by the processor, then while hauling asteroids out
in the Alpha 285 Asteroid Cluster, please be certain to choose the AEU Asteroid
processor. Fly safely and fight hard on the ground! [21:10 14 March 2318 GST]
