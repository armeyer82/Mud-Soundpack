17:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The points are okay. I make about 6 in 20 minutes, I think."

17:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Woo!"

17:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The money is pretty decent."

17:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's a lot of deliveries."

17:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't hauled in a while but I think hauling is better for points."

17:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Couriering should get much better as you get promoted, for money at least."

17:25 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "How do you check for weather you're eligable for a promotion with couriers?"

17:25 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "They'll send you a letter."

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll come find you."

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where are you currently?"

17:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say all taxes are taken out before we're paid."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was just wondering, because last time.. I had over a mil credited at the station, transfered the salvage, and I think I got less that what was credited. Unless, that was just because of a difference in currency."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it was likely that."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Our taxes are like 90%, so any difference related to taxes being taken out would be incredibly dramatic."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks Constant."

18:27 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not that I'm aware of. It does happen that way randomly sometimes, especially if your industry levels are similar."

18:28 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That being said, they're always making small changes and adjustments."

18:28 [Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not a chance..."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can name your files and folders whatever you want."

22:34 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also the computer itself, I thought."

22:35 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You can name files and folders anything you want. But you can't like. Put a label on it with your name or something."

22:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It is wearable, if that helps!"

22:35 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I left it in the voice office so I can't check."

22:36 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have never seen one labeled. You sure you didn't label a folder?"

22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Me neither, but I've done all mine for the conquest."

22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can run one tomorrow."

22:41 Shine the big white glowing felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Run... One? How about 2... or 3...?"

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, sure. That sounds good."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I mean if we have enough people interested."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd have no problem just burning down all four."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Woo hoo! Sounds good to me."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would give me time to try out a megapod later in the conquest."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "What're we talkin' bought?"

22:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Some nests."

22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ground deployment, on RATS nests."

22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Ah. Are you running a nest any time soon? That would be nice..?"

22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We have lots of new pilots now, so I'll probably leave the next slot I get with a lower tier league suit so I can run with you guys."

22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And then maybe an AEU suit once one of you wants to start leading."

22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Er... I mean.. blaze and glory, rocking out some RATS nests."

22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't do anymore this conquest, but I can do some tomorrow."

22:45 Shine the big white glowing felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's cool."

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually I've never used a fringe suit. Maybe once you have a tier 2 league, Johnathon, I can start bringing a damage suit."

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That'd be in a wee while..."

22:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, yeah."

22:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What points needed for a second suit, tier 2?"

22:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Where does one find out information about when abilities become available and such like."

22:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think you get the non-AEU tier 2's at 350."

22:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it's been quite a while so I don't remember."

22:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think there's an existing resource that tells you what point levels you need for specific abilities and such."

22:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That would be a huge book..."

22:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

22:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What I often do.. is... every 25 points or so, I check to see if there is anything new."

22:50 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is shutting down.

22:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Were you wanting those cylinders, Stone?"

22:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh no, I found a bunch of junk in one of my ships and got a bunch."

22:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "AH, nice."

22:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "By the way... what were you wanting them for?"

22:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To make a faster airlock pump for that asteroid hauler."

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right!"

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're good to have on artifacting and asteroid hauling ships, basically anything you use the airlock often on."

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was justing thinking that...."

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Just.. thinking.."

22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What do you need for parts to make those?"

22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let me see."

22:53 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Medium metal frame, handful of bolts, two circuit boards, two dozen pistons, and thirty-two cylinders."

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm..."

22:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The pistons I'll have to find... and the cylinders."

22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Definately need to do more nests."

22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Will be adding that on my 'need to get lists.."

22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, the parts aren't super rare or anything. If you need one once you start getting other ships, I can make you one."

22:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ok!"

23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I forsee a need for one in the future..."

23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If not two..."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is there a beacon locater device? Oh... never mind. Can't add that to courier vessels."

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon sings, "I got a letter"

23:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.
