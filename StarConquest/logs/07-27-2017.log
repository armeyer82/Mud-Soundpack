00:00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And there's no bari on those chunks, not that I know of anyways. The ones that were there before were there because pilots put them there."

00:00:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You know you can just go land on them yourself right?"

00:00:50 [MTTS] atherj: Not possible to just put a cap on those donations, for the interested parties?

00:01:49 [MTTS] atherj: I seem to recall something similar introduced a while back where a person can't give a cadet more than a set amount of credits. I don't know if that's still the case.

00:01:55 [MTTS] Ulias: I definitely see one in thre my character would want to be a part of, though it's one of the small weaker ones.

00:02:41 [MTTS] Squidmind: It's a combination of the regulations about how pilot economy interacts with general economy and the laws relating to how donations can be given to political parties, which has its own foibles.

00:02:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Give me a quick hand on the one rock there?"

00:02:49 [MTTS] atherj: Gocha.

00:03:22 [MTTS] Squidmind: So a civilian pilot might be able to give the heady sum of 10,000 credits... but that seems somewhat unhelpful from the pilot's perspective.

00:05:02 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh, that's still nice to know though. So a donation can be made just not a normal civilian pilot amount of insane credits like we toss around.

00:05:43 [MTTS] Ulias: More liketran 1 give you a hand?

00:05:49 [MTTS] Ulias: Ignore that please.

00:05:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Give you ahand?"

00:05:59 [MTTS] atherj: I am curious about one thing, though. You have cruisers, which cost about a half a bllion credits for example, right? But supposedly, that's not actually the full cost; only 5% of it. Does that mean that the cruiser really costs like 10 billion credits in actuality and the aliance funds that?

00:06:39 [MTTS] Ulias: It's more like 500 billion a week.

00:06:42 [MTTS] Squidmind: The exact figures are ill-defined but basically yes, atherj.  Starships are ridiculously expensive.

00:06:55 [MTTS] atherj: Gocha.

00:06:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I have been searching a bit more into that item you had me looking for since you said that was not it last night."

00:39:05 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:39:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:39:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:39:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:39:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Calm. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:39:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:39:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Calm."

00:39:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:39:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:39:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:39:36 The sensors tell you that this area of space is remarkably clear and free of hazards.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Residential Structure in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:58:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Residential Structure; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:30:57 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

02:30:59 You peer out...

02:30:59 
[Residential Structure; Docking Bay]
This docking bay is relatively quiet compared to most other similar facilities. As with other EAOS docking bays, the entire structure appears open to space, yet no air escapes. Signs indicate that the lobby is on the level above, and Spaceport facilities are below.
The one-person cargo hauler "Point A", the two-person Accord gemini "Quinacridone Rose", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

02:31:13 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:31:14 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:31:14 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:31:15 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:31:44 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'd be in too."

02:32:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Damnit Damion don't dare devise difficult descriptions for me to do dodging daffy descriptions and donkey-eared detritis of dawdlers and danglers who don't do it this disasterously."

02:32:38 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Eh, not that good."

02:32:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Holy mother of all blue glowing fucks."

02:33:02 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I just need a few minutes first."

02:33:03 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "See that was creative."

02:33:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! I resemble that remark."

02:33:31 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'll be a bit, I think I know where the tower is, but I haven't fully confirmed it yet."

02:33:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs. "Shit. Sorry Eli. I actually didn't mean that."

02:33:41 [General Communication] Damien Alexander cackles!

02:33:56 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Damien need half an hour."

02:34:03 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Aww and see I thought I was getting useful intelligence if I ever... Scouted dangly bits."

02:34:05 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "He does."

02:34:35 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "And also lexie, so I think we're full if that is the case."

02:35:32 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well you know what they say. Once you go blue, nothing else will do."

02:41:12 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

02:45:05 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok ready whenever."

02:46:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww, Lexie, I couldn't get to my comm, but thank you for that."

02:47:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I will now steal it for my own nefarious purposes."

02:47:22 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Steal which?"

02:47:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Once you go blue, nothing else will do."

02:47:47 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ahh. My gift to you."

02:48:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just so you don't think I'm completely nuts, and in case you don't know, I actually am blue."

02:49:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I uh.. had soem bad salad dressing."

02:50:12 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I've hugged you silly man, of course I know you're blue. I hadn't drunk that much that night."

02:50:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah alright, well you never know. It would surprise you the number of people who don't seem to notice."

02:51:20 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well if you were wearing a silly white hat, and sang stupid songs, then I'd probably not notice, but no, it suits you in an odd way."

02:52:27 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just don't get any funny ideas about drinking strange vials from the megapod. The others that had similar um.. accidents with them didn't turn out so well."

02:54:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "He is not only blue. But he is glowing too. That's why I felt like a dick when I said that before. Again. Sorry Eli."

02:54:24 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Uh...that wasn't supposed to rime."

02:54:30 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Noted."

02:55:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There was a lass sublime, who wasn't supposed to rhyme, but she did it my pet, and it was bad you bet, so we shot her from space, toward a moon's face, and now she don't rhyme, accept with dead."

02:56:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn Lexi, I do't know how you do that, it's amazing."

02:56:14 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Years and years of writing naughty things on walls."

02:56:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs. "Screw you, Lex."

02:56:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You already offered earlier and I turned you down. And again I say, no."

02:56:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

02:56:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have never offered."

02:57:06 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "There once was a man from Nantucket."

02:57:10 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I've conveniently forgotten the rest of it. Be grateful."

02:57:14 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You told me to get the flavor of my audience, and you included yourself in that collective noun."

02:58:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Residential Structure; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-bindin
03:08:57 g resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government
03:08:57  and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 10 July 2317 GST. Time remaining: 24 days, 22 hours, 55 minutes, and 22 seconds

03:33:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sure. I'm a few sectors into deep space, jsut a moment."

03:33:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:33:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:33:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:42:45 You peer out...

12:42:46 
[Residential Structure; Docking Bay]
This docking bay is relatively quiet compared to most other similar facilities. As with other EAOS docking bays, the entire structure appears open to space, yet no air escapes. Signs indicate that the lobby is on the level above, and Spaceport facilities are below.
The one-person cargo hauler "Point A", the two-person Accord gemini "Quinacridone Rose", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

12:42:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:42:50 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

12:42:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

12:42:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:42:59 The ship is already moving.

12:43:02 The ship is already moving.

12:43:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Enter your selection:

12:43:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:43:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:43:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

12:43:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:43:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:43:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:43:12 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:43:15 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

12:49:02 a big white glowing felo kitten

12:49:02 This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, speckled white fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked white claws visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes with vertical pupils. It puts out a subtle white bioluminescence tinged with light green.

14:33:54 You blink heavily and then doze off.

14:48:20 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

15:01:09 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Six reapers in a-23."

15:03:48 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Just as a suggestion, it seems like there's more and more rats appearing.

15:04:09 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:04:09 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:04:17 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Not awake, will do later."

15:04:29 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

15:04:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:04:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:04:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Fair enough. I"m not really awake either. But spread the word."

15:04:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:04:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:04:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:05:00 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'll go kill some rats."

15:05:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:05:23 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Thanks. We cleared like 10 or 12 sectors this morning, and they're starting to reappear already."

15:05:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Dusty Reaches. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:05:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:05:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

15:05:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:05:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:05:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:05:44 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.

15:05:46 Via general sector communication, Beacon C-09 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Dusty Reaches."

15:05:49 There are no other ships in the sector.

15:23:49 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:23:52 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

15:24:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:24:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:24:48 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:24:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

15:24:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:25:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:25:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:25:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:25:09 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:25:39 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

15:37:20 You blink heavily and then doze off.

15:48:20 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

15:53:19 There appear to be about 8 pilots recently active.

16:48:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

16:50:27 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you guys know what Nicolette'r oganization is called?"

16:50:33 [General Communication] Constantine Stone coughs.

16:50:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nicolett's."

16:50:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nicolette's, sorry."

16:50:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone sighs.

16:51:31 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "It's SHIT. The Society for Harmonious Interstellar Teamwork."

16:52:09 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

17:14:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going, Vernos?"

17:15:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Never the way I want it to."

17:15:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What happened?"

17:15:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nothing so far."

17:36:42 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 1,631,043.90 credits.

17:48:52 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 873,238.59 credits.

17:50:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

18:15:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh.. now that's kinda scary."

18:15:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's that?"

18:15:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good morning Constantine."

18:16:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli."

18:16:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And.. the fact that you and I? Are the only ones awake in communications range."

18:16:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:16:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Imagine how I felt before you chimed in."

18:16:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah.. no shit, wow."

18:16:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Feel like a beacon? I need 10 points to get the next combat grid."

18:17:27 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:17:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:17:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You were probably nervously singing a little song about "Don't let there be an attack right now, doobie doobie doobie.. aliens don't look this way just yet... doo doo doo""

18:19:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I put it together inside the constructor."

18:19:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll try to be quick, but I'll probably be at least a half an hour. So I won't hold it against you guys if you end up wanting to go before that, if someon else wakes up."

18:19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm fine to wait."

18:19:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got nowhere to be."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:15:26 Not much to see out there.

19:15:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:15:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:15:32 You peer out...

19:15:33 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

19:15:36 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:15:36 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:15:38 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

19:15:38 You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:15:38 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

19:15:43 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

19:15:43 You can go up.

19:15:48 Board what?

19:15:51 Board what?

19:15:57 Board what?

19:16:01 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

19:16:01 The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

19:16:06 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

19:16:07 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.

19:16:07 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:16:08 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

19:16:08 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:16:10 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:21:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:21:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:21:19 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:21:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:21:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:21:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:21:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Calm. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:21:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:21:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

19:21:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:59:01 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:59:01 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:59:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:59:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:59:05 You peer out...

19:59:06 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

19:59:10 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:59:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:59:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:59:24 The ship is already moving.

19:59:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:59:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:59:26 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:59:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:59:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:59:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:59:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:59:33 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:46:51 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Anka! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

20:46:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you.

20:47:00 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "beep beep"

20:47:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I've forgotten a time two myself, on my own ships."

20:47:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:47:04 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:47:06 Via general sector communication, Anka transmits a text-based transmission: "dit dit"

20:47:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Critical Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:47:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:47:10 Constantine Stone asks, "Is that something the pilot uses?"

20:47:15 You nod.

20:47:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

20:47:17 You say, "It is."

20:47:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:47:22 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:47:22 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:47:24 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

20:47:24 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and Orby the security hoverbot here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey and Constantine Stone are standing here.
You can go south and out.

20:47:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:47:27 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

20:47:28 You can go out and enter into the ship.

You can go out.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey and Constantine Stone followed you.
Orby the security hoverbot floats in after Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

20:47:39 Ali Candan just arrived.

20:47:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It dapens the enemy ships sensors, making it harder for them to hit critical components."

20:47:42 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "One more call. One more for beacons."

20:47:49 You hold Ali Candan's hand, taking him into your group.

20:47:53 You wave to Ali Candan.

20:47:54 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:47:55 Ali Candan waves.

20:48:05 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

20:48:15 Constantine Stone says, "Hey Ali."

20:48:20 Ali Candan says, "Heya."

20:48:23 A pair of engineers suddenly begin a heated political debate.

20:48:31 You ask, "Ok, please leave room 3 open for me and I'll engineer. Constantine, still want evasions?"

20:48:37 Eli says to Constantine, "They're awesome, in my opinion. And the only one of the three alliance specific techs that can actually assist another ship."

20:48:42 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah if you don't mind."

20:48:44 You grin at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

20:48:50 You say to Constantine, "Then go for it."

20:48:51 Constantine Stone says, "But if you feel like flying by all means."

20:48:53 Constantine Stone nods.

20:48:56 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

20:48:57 You can go up.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey, Constantine Stone, and Ali Candan followed you.

Orby the security hoverbot floats in after Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

20:49:02 Ali Candan strides south.

20:49:03 You disband your group.

20:49:03 Constantine Stone grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from him.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:49:04 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Corridor]

20:49:04 You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "One pile from storage per pilot. Thank you." here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

20:49:06 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive and an overstuffed red chair here.
You can go north and south.

20:49:10 You sit down on an overstuffed red chair.

20:49:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:49:16 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

20:49:18 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, I hadn't thought about that."

20:49:21 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's true."

20:49:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:49:26 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:49:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:49:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:49:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:49:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:49:34 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So which button works the dampener?"

20:49:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:49:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:49:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:49:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:49:45 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "The dampen button."

20:49:50 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, I see it."

20:49:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What did Imiss?"

20:50:16 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

20:50:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, thought I missed something, with folks saying that's true and I hadn't thought about that."

20:50:26 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:50:28 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, no."

20:50:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:50:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:50:42 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I just meant that about what you said about the dampeners being able to assist other ships in danger."

20:50:43 Starship Damage:

20:50:43 
No damaged components.


Hull damage failsafes remaining: 20%, 40%, 60%, 80%, and 97%

20:50:47 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Shule, I love your plaques man. They're cracking me up. Iknow that's not the intention, but still."

20:50:58 You laugh into the PA microphone.

20:51:00 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:51:01 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks."

20:51:09 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh yeah, There's been a lot of times that Ijust dampened a ship from my fighter and then just hung back so I wouldn't get in the way."

20:51:13 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Again, I got sick of repeating myself."

20:51:20 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:51:22 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, that's a good idea."

20:51:23 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Course, some people don't read them."

20:51:30 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I had been holding off of putting one on my fighter."

20:51:39 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Since a missed hit on my hull would probably take out half my weapons."

20:51:40 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:51:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh."

20:51:55 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I put it on every combat ship."

20:52:00 The starship transitions into another sector.

20:52:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:52:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, me too. And with a bolt thrower on as well, an AEU ship can make a mean, mean support ship."

20:52:32 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep."

20:52:38 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

20:52:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:52:42 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "High out!"

20:55:25 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Engineering Room]

20:55:25 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

21:16:14 You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Please only use lasers unless otherwise directed. Thank you." and an overstuffed red chair here.
You can go south and down.

21:16:14 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Corridor]

21:16:14 You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "One pile from storage per pilot. Thank you." here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

21:16:15 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, and a black leather sofa here.
You can go south and out.

21:16:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:16:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:16:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:16:26 [General Communication] "Lexie, you didn't go on the trip!" Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cheers. "Ithought that life was going to be punless for a while."

21:16:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:16:34 Which sector did you mean?

21:16:34 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

21:16:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:16:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:16:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:16:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:16:40 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

21:16:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:16:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:16:42 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:16:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

21:16:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:16:46 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There could always be quantum puns."

21:16:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:16:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:16:48 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:16:50 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Critical Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:16:51 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No one invited me. I"m the girl that is the best friend of all the other girls so they'll look better, but doesn't get invited to anything."

21:16:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's like a pun and a puzzle, figuring out the limmericks without vowels."

21:16:58 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um.. wait.. I think I knew this already."

21:17:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww I'm sure that's not true Lexie."

[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Why you think I have tim to come up with limericks?"

21:17:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They take you time? You seem to just crank them out so naturally."

21:17:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:17:51 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:17:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Critical Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:17:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:18:00 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,050,578.67 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

21:18:05 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But no, I wasn't around when trip tickets were handed out in any case."

21:18:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:18:09 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:18:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:18:11 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:18:13 You scramble to your feet.

21:18:13 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:18:14 You exit the ship.

21:18:14 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

21:18:14 [The Torus; Garage]

21:18:15 You can go up.

21:18:16 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Sometimes."

21:18:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:18:17 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:18:18 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:18:18 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:18:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Then there's those other times."

21:18:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Should have just spoke up. As far as I know it was just an open invitation. Melinda just asked on gneral who wanted to go."

21:18:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er on general."

21:18:41 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:18:50 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Must have been dozing."

21:19:14 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Never hurts to ask, for sure. But I'm glad you are here with us."

21:19:31 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Me too. I would have missed out on the rat killin' earlier today if I hadn't been here."

21:20:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "RATS worry me."

21:20:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm afraid that one day we're going to see something else, something we haven't seen yet."

21:20:50 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I just popped about sixteen of them. They really beat my ship to hell."

21:20:59 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, Yeah I bet they did."

21:21:04 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well a bunch of us fringers went out and destroyed them where we could find them. There was rats in the first five sectors I landed in and we decided it was better to thin them out some. Honestly, we should probably do more nests. A lot of sectors where cadets are flying a lot too."

21:21:11 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Had help from peacekeepers with one group though, that helped."

21:21:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I would have if I wasn't out here at 285."

21:21:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, more nests would help. In particular it concerns me how some older pilots say things like they're not really a threat."

21:21:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would do a nest."

21:21:45 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "OH good, make us all megacredits!"

21:21:50 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Agreed."

21:21:53 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "After I drop this rest station off."

21:22:01 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I do not have a time for a nest for another hour and a half or so."

21:22:15 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'd be game once I get back, but I don't know how much interest we'd have."

21:22:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let's believe in ourselves."

21:22:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We can do it!"

21:22:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "AEU sectors have been oddly rat-free lately."

21:22:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Every time I check the frontier sectors they're always empty."

21:23:08 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's cause best was built by them."

21:23:14 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

21:24:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In all seriousnes, they have seemed to be really prominent in unclaimed and fringe space. I didn't see any when I tried AEU or league space at all. Makes me wonder if there's a series or nests or something out our way."

21:24:39 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I have a theory about roid dogs pertaining to RATS. Ithink they might be some sort of asteroid harvesting version. It's strange that they aren't ever seen closer to human space though, with the rest of the RATS."

21:24:44 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, when we do nests later, let's look around Fringe space."

21:24:53 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "For that matter, I wonder where all the rocks have gone."

21:25:24 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's an interesting theory."

21:26:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's hard to say, there are many that believe they are just a myth, though I saw a photo once of someones hatch that was definitley torn into by somethin glarge and strong on an asteroid."

21:27:17 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Oh, some were heard on our last hauling trip out."

21:27:24 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Or felt or whatever."

21:27:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well most myths have some form of truth behind them, even if it's not the truth reported."

21:27:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I had heard that someone thought that they heard one, yeah."

21:27:57 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Plus, I figure, since there are space whales and dragons, why not roid dogs."

21:28:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No reason to bleieve that they didn't in my opinion."

21:28:43 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Dragons? Now that's a new one on me."

21:28:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Too bad you folks didn't take your roid cannons and set a trap. Tie the damn thing up in cables and bring it back."

21:29:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yes, Lexie. I know it sounds far fetched but space dragons are most definitely real."

21:29:26 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yes, there are dragons and other interesting space creatures if you go places. I have seen the pictures."

21:29:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn things are as big as battlecruisers, maybe ven bigger."

21:29:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And they breathe plasma."

21:30:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've never seen one myself, so I could be off on some of that, I've only seen pictures."

21:30:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Note to self, do not go to the same night clbs as Johann and Eli."

21:30:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

21:30:59 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When everyone gets back, I know a couple of them have albums with images of these things."

21:31:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I wouldn't be surprised though. My mom and dad used to tell me stories of weird stuff they'd encountered while they were out working."

21:32:01 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's even jellyfish like things. And the space whales emit a signal that some folks have taken to calling a song. It screws up a ships equipment, Ibelieve making it so that it can't move. Lukcily though the wahels are not aggressive, or so I"ve been told."

21:32:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. the whales, I mean."

21:32:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If they're really that big I wonder if they're some sort of organic ship."

21:32:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, that's my belief."

21:33:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Someone tried to argue that they weren't because they watched two of the dragons.. or maybe it was the lions? tear apart a bari spreader. But we attack spreaders too so I don't think that argument is really valid."

21:33:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The dragons do lay eggs though."

21:34:06 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No. Not at all. And if the bari grow mold on them it might be more destructive to their systems than they are to ours."

21:34:12 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:34:12 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

21:55:28 You say to Tara, "I've always wanted to explore and meet new cultures, roam new planets and such."

21:56:04 Tara nods in agreement "Yes! The first time I was attacked was quite terrifying, the RATs took my turrets out before I got my wits about me, so I jumped away." she pauses and quietly listens to you, nodding along.

21:56:13 You say, "My family wanted me to have a well... what they called a real job."

21:56:18 You chuckle.

21:56:19 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Might have just been the survival of the wittiest in play. The law of the differentiation of topics dictates that when the wittiness of a topic has reached its largest possible density of dumb comments, a new topic is born and differentiates from the previous, the previous becomes extinct, and new wit flourishes."

21:56:23 The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.

21:56:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

21:56:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah yes, the spherical cube hypothesis."

21:56:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach yawns violently.

21:56:51 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'm a master of the extinct topic."

21:57:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

21:57:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Eve! Don't do that, haven't you seen the public service announcement about yawning on Comms?"

21:57:18 Tara says to you, "I guess they took it as a suprise when you decided to be a pilot?"

21:57:31 You say to Tara, "I've always felt that I was too independent and that we, as a human race could learn a lot from what's out there in the universe."

21:57:32 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I indeed have, and I do it coz it annoys people."

21:57:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

21:57:53 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oops I miscommed that piece of drollery one moment."

21:58:07 You say, "Oh, they knew I probably would want to be a pilot. They just fought me every step of the way."

21:58:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

21:58:20 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There was a lass from ars magna that yawned, every morning at just about dawn, she opened wider and wider, and swallowed her spider, and now, alas, she is gone."

21:58:24 You say, "But I've been known to be persistent now and then."

21:58:28 You grin.

21:58:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

21:58:56 You say to a shiny chrome trash bin, "What about you?"

21:59:02 You say to Tara, "What about you?"

21:59:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey pats a shiny chrome trash bin lightly.

21:59:14 Eli says to a shiny chrome trash bin, "You always  wanted to be a trash bin, didn't you?"

21:59:14 You grin at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

21:59:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

21:59:24 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But anyway Eli, that was a whale of a good story earlier, and I'll stop dragon my butt around nad get back to work."

21:59:26 You chuckle.

21:59:55 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

21:59:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, well I'm glad you found it it interesting. There's others that culd probably tell it better."

22:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So uh. I had a super weird dream. And I blame the fact that we've been talking about clippers a bunch."

22:00:13 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I'd be lion if I said I didn't believe you."

22:00:13 You gesture vaguely at a shiny chrome trash bin. "Maybe it always aspired to be a dumpster instead."

22:00:19 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

22:00:29 You laugh.

22:00:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You? Dreams? Weird? Why does that all fit together so nicely?"

22:00:46 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

22:00:46 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs. "Fuck off lex."

22:01:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:01:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Was it a dream were shule, Constatine, and I kicked a bunch of ass in a clipper?"

22:01:08 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I tried, but he's hard to catch."

22:01:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I hate you all. I love clippers!"

22:01:42 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Decides to shave Evenia in her sleep with her custom clippers."

22:01:49 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

22:01:53 I don't understand that.

22:01:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:02:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:02:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww, but her ahir is growing back out so nicely after the laast time."

22:02:12 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok give with the dream already."

22:02:21 Tara is quiet for a few long moments before saying "Part of the reason I became a pilot was to spite some people I know." she says to you. "Not going to lie, it felt good to do that."

22:02:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

22:02:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm going to guess it was firestorm. If so. I'm letting you know now shule. That I am personally. Deeply offended."

22:02:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey looks at Tara Flores thoughtfully.

22:02:43 You grin at Tara Flores. "I understand."

22:02:53 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awww."

22:02:57 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It was."

22:03:08 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And what can I do to make it y up to you?"

22:03:10 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:03:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. no it was uh.. some other clipper, yeah,  that's it."

22:03:20 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:03:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It was called um.. Stormfire."

22:03:28 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

22:03:33 You say to Tara, "I know the feeling."

22:03:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I will get my revenge, damn it."

22:03:58 Eli says to Tara, "Certainly worse ways to spite someone than helping out the Union."

22:04:00 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smiles.

22:04:02 You grin.

22:04:18 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Notice she's still not telling us what the dream was. I bet she was engineering and there was a major malfunction."

22:04:20 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "How come my clipper... everyone knows the name of?"

22:04:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I always whine that I want clipper beacons. So this means I will definitely get revenge. Keep an eye out behind you. Shule."

22:04:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I didn't until just now actually."

22:04:57 Shule looks over his shoulder.

22:05:04 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm keeping an eye out."

22:05:10 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um...because It's stormed 2 of my beacons. I can't exactly forget that."

22:05:14 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I shall remain on my guard."

22:05:16 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person isotope "Ex Nihilo Nihil Fit". The organization has earned 852,629.25 credits and 1 megacredit.

22:05:20 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:05:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe it was that dream where you show up to crew for a beacon and you realize that you're naked."

22:05:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I thought that was Cesar's beacons all of the time."

22:06:17 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, sorry. Those were topless beacons."

22:06:23 You hear someone happily recount a recent asteroid mining victory.

22:06:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "She stormed me once when I was in a cipactli, and once when I was...I wanna say it was a corvette?"

22:06:57 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, yeah. I remember that."

22:07:04 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "The dream, we wanna hear the dream."

22:07:10 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry Eve."

22:07:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So yeah, I remember that name."

22:07:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

22:07:16 Tara nods a little to you , shrugging her hsoulders "I was a book worm and couldn't really get out much when I was young, it first started with novels, but I started reading everything I could, from news articles to text books."

22:07:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:07:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wait... That person was female? I've only heard of that name in the news."

22:07:33 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I also thought Cesar was a man's name."

22:07:34 Shule nods and listens to Tara.

22:07:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nah. I'm not picking at you shule. Just saying how I remember."

22:08:03 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person fighter "Bali Mynah" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

22:08:05 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No, Cesar was always encouraging topless beacons. He was a male."

22:08:16 Eli mutters something hard to make out, it sounds like, "Sure doesn't look like a bookworm..."

22:08:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Topless beacons are fun, so are naked beacons."

22:08:21 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

22:08:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Keep an eye out Shule. She's just trying to lull you into a false sense of security. Then you'll wake up with a spider plastered to your face."

22:08:47 Eli looks around, a little embarrassed.

22:08:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with ham and cheese.

22:09:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I mean um."

22:09:10 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "The dream the dreeam we scream for the dream with a stream of high beams and shcemes to get the dream the dream."

22:09:12 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ummm, I wouldn't know about naked beacons."

22:09:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You should always be fully clothed during a beacon."

22:09:31 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Doesn't sound like something my innocent ears should hear."

22:09:50 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hear that he ain't never been screwed in the ears."

22:09:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Shule. If you're innocent. I'm white with pink hair."

22:10:09 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Then Eve. It must be so."

22:10:14 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras pauses dramatically, then transmits, ".,.. you mean... you're not? this rocks my entire world view."

22:10:20 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

22:10:25 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:10:30 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you pink with white hair?"

22:10:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Shit no?"

22:10:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

22:10:45 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No I think she's got tentacles that are pink though."

22:10:48 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:10:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have I seen you? I don't know if I ever have."

22:11:02 You say to Tara, "Well, I'm glad you joined the pilot corps."

22:11:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm dark-skinned, with ebony hair."

22:11:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

22:11:23 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "We can chop that off and make a bundle in the fake antiques market."

22:11:23 A nearby pilot lectures at length about why having diplomatic relations with other alliances is stupid.

22:11:28 Eli smiles and nods in agreement with you, "We need all the good folks we can get these days."

22:11:38 You nod and grin.

22:11:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a sip of a curiously shaped bottle of water.

22:11:41 You say, "For sure."

22:11:45 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the four-person mule "Lion's Den" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

22:11:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "A real ebony hair desk only 18 trillion credits."

22:12:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And I'm that nice person that did you good deals with a couple crafted things, remember?"

22:12:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I definitely remember that you're nice and gave me great deals."

22:12:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You are. I'd split the 18 trillion 60/40 that's because you did those nice things."

22:12:25 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just don't remember if we did them in person."

22:12:42 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "He's one of those men. Doesn't remember the girl. Smack him Eve."

22:12:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:12:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah,  she's the dark skinned, dark haired lady that looks like she could kick our asses."

22:12:49 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:13:04 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:13:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She's a sweetheart though, don't let her fool you."

22:13:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I don't think so. But we should actually like. Do that face to face thing. Sometime."

22:13:07 Tara stretches her arms a little, sipping at her espresso some more as she then continues on "See, I was a really big media buff, trying to pick up on any sort of news, and I always wondered 'Why're pilots treated like this in the first place?' I asked my family, and I learned just how much my family hates them, an order of magnitude greater then most."

22:13:11 Tara Flores takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

22:13:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah we should."

22:13:21 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe when I call for a nest."

22:13:23 You nod to Tara Flores.

22:13:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In like 15."

22:14:09 Tara Flores says, "I mean, I knew that pilot make tons of money, so much money it kind of makes money have no meaning, now that im a cadet."

22:14:18 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok be back in a bit for that nest. Got to go take care of some domestic chores."

22:14:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I haven't even downed my first coffee yet. You don't want me anywhere near. A nest. I'd probably blind my AEU suit. And flash my Fringe. Then I'd maybe remember to shoot the bad robot guy."

22:14:40 You nod to Tara Flores. "Oh, you'll make much more as you continue in your career."

22:14:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:14:48 "Yeah, that's the truth." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins. "My dad would slap me if he saw how much credits I toss around on a whim, if he were still around."

22:15:07 Tara Flores says, "But, if your an astute reader, you learn to read between the lines, see things hidden within the words, and it just made me ask questions."

22:15:16 You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

22:15:28 You nod to Tara Flores. "Definitely."

22:15:37 You say to Eli, "So would my entire family."

22:15:52 Eli says to Tara, "Oh Tara, we need someone like you more than ever. A thinker, a seeker of truth. I'm very pleased to hear this."

22:16:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And dragonfly, hush you. Stop telling people lies about me. I'm a horrible humorless cold person."

22:16:08 Shule nods in agreement., "Most definitely"

22:16:15 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I said nothing."

22:16:23 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, you weren't talking to me."

22:16:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You are not a dragonfly."

22:16:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

22:16:48 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:17:03 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, I'm not?"

22:17:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:17:11 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She claims to be evil. So evil that she takes care of everyone's pets. Oh, the horror!"

22:17:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nope, you are not."

22:17:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey! I have a soft spot for beautiful fuzzy creatures. Hush you."

22:18:23 A seagull flaps by the window.

22:18:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with ham and cheese.

22:18:29 Tara nods "My biggest motivation to become a pilot is to experience it for myself, and well, ironically, you mention a seeker of truth." she pauses, grinning to Eli My favorite kind of novels were always about those daring adventurers who go off into the unknown, pioneering for others, breaking traditions and taboos along the way." she laughs "My parents biggest mistake was trying to sensor the stuff and keep me away from it when they learned of my interest in it. What happens when you do that to a teenager?"

22:18:48 You chuckle. "Yeah, bad idea."

22:18:51 Eli looks relieved at Tara's words.

22:19:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:19:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So um.. I'm with Lexie on this whole dream thing, you ever gonna get to that?"

22:19:57 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, what was the dream. Stop killing us with suspense."

22:20:23 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

22:20:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But anyway. This dream. Somehow. The clipper could carry 3 battlesuits. And so 3 of us went out to see if we couldn't do GMG with 3 people. But when we got out there. The clipper wouldn't let us out. And it kept like. Turning it's systems on and off. And got a mind of it's own. Then somehow. Orby started ignoring Eli's commands and got out the airlock. And destroyed the thing."

22:20:40 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ah.. not just a thinker, but a rebellious one.. Perfect."

22:20:45 You grin.

22:20:56 You grin at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "She'll be right at home with us."

22:21:05 Eli noggles at you.

22:21:29 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sounds like Best got ahold of that clipper."

22:21:32 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow! That's a weird dream indeed."

22:22:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:22:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Destroyed.. the clipper?"

22:22:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It was all kinds of strange."

22:22:23 A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back out.

22:22:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well yeah. We ended up in a pod, but Orby saved us."

22:22:55 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, the clipper was evil."

22:23:12 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "All the evil clippers."

22:23:20 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:23:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what it sounds like. And a hoverbot was either really stron, or the clipper was really weak."

22:23:30 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I fucking love clippers, but that was a strange dream."

22:23:49 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sounds like you need to lay off the drugs."

22:23:58 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No you told the dream while I was gone. You you you spider loving....you urgh!"

22:24:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs. "I didn't have any."

22:24:09 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey keys his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:24:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Poor Lexie."

22:24:15 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's what they all say until you propose a drug test."

22:24:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Bring it."

22:24:30 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So did we ever get this nest idea off the ground?"

22:24:41 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, three for a nest!"

22:24:48 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Come one, come all."

22:24:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All three."

22:24:54 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok i'm in fringe 1.5."

22:24:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Coffee, bad nest."

22:25:15 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You and your coffee, you'll just be fiercer blowing things up."

22:25:23 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes that time they almost decided to lead an expedition.

22:25:30 Tara lets out a laugh "My parents are ..really, really wealthy, especially for people who live a life on a planet. Heavy into businesses, and investments, you know? and they play that well." she shook her head "They wanted me in on that, especially my father. He's running a business for really fancy clothing, you know?" a touch of anger comes to her face and voice "and he wanted to use me as some model, but ..I guess enough on that?" she shrugs, looking to Eli, curious "What about you?"

22:26:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh Ather. You just reminded me by talking. That I have 2 questions for you. Do you still have that airlock cycle plant. And can you send me the parts list for that um. The asteroid scanner thing. If you could be so...Well not kind. but considerate?"

22:26:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Tara, Vernos? Nests for glory?"

22:27:12 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I think we'll have to give it up as a bad show Constantine."

22:27:13 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Kindness is an irrelevant concept."

22:27:20 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know, it's sad."

22:27:21 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But yes, I do have both."

22:27:23 A seagull flaps by the window.

22:27:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rats win the day."

22:27:35 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the four-person mule "Lion's Den" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

22:27:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, not both cycle plants, but the list and the plant."

22:27:55 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "It'll be so grand when I have the other cycling plant."

22:28:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Is it 150 mill for that plant? I'm guessing so."

22:28:04 Eli grins at Tara, "Oh, I come from pretty humble beginnings. I was born here on New Earth here. My dad was a carpenter, so as you can imagine, we didn't have much money. Everything's all plasteel and transparasteel these days. Not really the best profession to be in."

22:28:45 Shule sits back and listens.

22:28:53 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Right."

22:29:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I mail you said beautiful credits, could you get me one ready?"

22:29:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But he was stubbron about it, We were always travelling, never really staying in one place. He used to tell me stories about the things that were going on, civilian pilots and all that. I'll never forget the day he told me about the Outsider ship sowing up.""

22:29:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hard to make friends, that way."

22:30:03 You nod.

22:30:21 Tara Flores speaks into her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

22:30:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Maybe later? Relaxing at the lounge right now."

22:30:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure, just checking."

22:30:33 Tara Flores finishes off a hot cup of espresso.

22:30:52 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Anyways, one day we relocated to Hyperion, Jacktown folks still like to use wood in their construction. So there was a lot of work there, we finally settled down. Just a little apartment in Jacktown, but still."

22:31:23 Tara finishes her espresso, setting the cup side and keeping her attention on Eli, her expression obviously curious.

22:31:57 Eli's eyes grow dreamy as he speaks, "but that trip over there though.. looking out into that vast infinte void? My imagination went wild with what could be out there."

22:32:04 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "In a little while."

22:32:15 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the four-person mule "Lion's Den" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

22:32:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh yeah. No rush on it. But I'll send the credits so it's done."

22:33:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "He didn't want me to do it of course, did everything he could to discourage me. But I started waiting tables and saving every credit I could get my hands on to get ino the academy, and spent my nights on the roof of hte apartments staring into the night sky. Not a lot of light pollution over there, on Hyperion. I could see everything."

22:33:35 You say, "I love Hyperion."

22:34:24 A pair of engineers suddenly begin a heated political debate.

22:34:46 Tara smiles a little "Sounds like theres a lot of things I need to see."

22:35:06 You nod and grin at Tara Flores.

22:35:24 Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.

22:36:08 You say to Tara, "There is so much to see out there."

22:36:30 "Well, one day, when he saw that I wasn't going to give up, he gave me this..." Eli thumbs a small silver dragonfly on a chain thoughtfully.  "He said it was my mother's she died in childbirth, I don't know if Imentioned that or not. He also gave me all the credits he'd been saving to buy a home. Said that my mother would have wanted me to follow my dream , that she always loved watching the dragonflies fly, and that she would have loved that I wanted to be like them. And so , here I am"he academy, and spent my nights on the roof of hte apartments staring into the night sky. Not a lot of light pollution over th.

22:36:45 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Ug."

22:36:52 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Please gloss over that last part."

22:37:24 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

22:37:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Real. Decent. Coffee. You make my heart glad."

22:37:52 Tara Flores puts a cup in a shiny chrome trash bin.

22:37:55 Tara Flores puts a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" in a sturdy dark green canvas backpack.

22:38:23 A nearby pilot lectures at length about why having diplomatic relations with other alliances is stupid.

22:38:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Whew.. sorry I got um.. carried away with myself there."

22:38:35 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a sip of a curiously shaped bottle of water.

22:38:50 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I guess I could have just said "I really, really wanted to see space.""

22:38:54 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

22:38:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with ham and cheese.

22:39:09 I don't understand that.

22:39:14 You chuckle at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey. "It's ok."

22:39:45 Tara smiles brightly and nods to Eli "Thats pretty awesome of your dad." she shakes her head and smiles "No, I think your passion and enthusiasim is a good thing, you need to enjoy what you do, right? I've a saying: If its not fun its not worth doing. I'm enjoying myself as a pilot."

22:39:58 You say, "I agree."

22:40:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smiles and nods to Tara Flores.

22:40:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Sadly the Union doesn't support exploration as much as it used to, but that hasn't stopped me from getting out there when I can."

22:40:24 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

22:40:35 You say, "Yeah, that is sad."

22:41:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:41:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok so who out there is a replon."

22:41:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's a replon?"

22:41:54 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I am an infiltrator robot."

22:41:55 Tara says to Eli, "Yeah, I intend to buy an exploration ship when I graduate out of cadet status."

22:41:56 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Beep beep boop."

22:42:09 You grin at Tara Flores. "Awesome."

22:42:18 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Look stinky woke up."

22:42:19 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Keegan sir. You are many things. But..."

22:42:30 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey keys his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:42:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Hey, you never know, maybe if there was one, they would have fallen for it."

22:43:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Tara Flores.

22:43:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I want me a real live space dragon. Hell. Even an egg would do. I stare at the poster on my wall. All the time."

22:43:55 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:43:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Where would you keep it? On a big leash tied to Ars magna?"

22:44:05 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

22:44:31 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. He would guard my beautiful home planet."

22:44:58 Eli says to Tara, "A lot of folks go on expiditions too. There's no harm in going on expiditons run by pilot's of other alliances either. It's a good way to get experience."

22:45:10 You say, "Most definitely."

22:45:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And I'd bring him out when people pissed me off."

22:45:19 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Best is robot infiltrator."

22:45:24 A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back out.

22:45:43 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Like when Firestorm storms your beacons?"

22:46:02 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey pats Tara Flores on the back. "I think you are going to fit in just fine around here, and thank the stars for that."

22:46:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That would be a perfect time. Yes. Bastard."

22:46:11 You grin.

22:46:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, I'll be sure not to go visit that planet after storming said beacons."

22:47:20 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. I'll hook him to someone's cruiser. And we'll come find you."

22:47:25 Eli says to you, "Hey, you never know. Remember that Best supporter cadet we had a while back? Yeesh."

22:47:37 You say to Eli, "Oh goodness. Yeah, I do."

22:47:48 Tara smiles some and nods "I hope to. As far as I know my older sister followed in my footsteps." she says, a bit of scorn in her voice. "So I won't let her out pace me." she said competitively.

22:48:10 You grin at Tara Flores. "That's the spirit."

22:48:13 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "An infiltrator, or just a traitor, has neither a mater or pater."

22:48:22 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh? So we can expect another cadet sometime soonish? Excellent."

22:48:33 Tara Flores nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

22:48:47 You exclaim, "Very cool!"

22:48:59 You say, "I look forward to neew pilots joining us."

22:49:31 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh dear. Well, thankfully, my clipper is a bit faster than cruisers."

22:49:43 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well, I certainly hope she's as opened minded and eager to get out there as you seem to be Ms. Flores."

22:49:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Never fear, we'll find you anyway."

22:49:58 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with ham and cheese.

22:50:17 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the one-person cargo hauler "Vortex Industries 414" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

22:50:24 You hear someone happily recount a recent asteroid mining victory.

22:50:26 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person cargo hauler "Vortex Industries 414" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

22:50:28 Tara Flores speaks into her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

22:50:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I only have an AEU battlesuit, by the way, Con. That wont be a problem right?"

22:50:28 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'll just hide in... umm... my apartment? Oh, didn't mean to say that outloud."

22:50:37 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

22:50:41 Eli says to you, "A couple of sisters? This could liven things up around here quite a bit."

22:50:45 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

22:50:50 You grin.

22:50:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'll have him breathe plasma on the apartment complex, that'll make you come out."

22:50:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, that would work fine. I couldn't get enough people though, so we'll try another time."

22:51:13 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:51:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! I live there too, I think?"

22:51:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Plasmaplex coming to a ground zero near you."

22:51:24 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

22:51:29 Tara shudders and says to Eli "Just Tara is fine, every time I hear Ms. Flores I start ducking for cover and looking around for my grandma."

22:51:29 Eli says to you, "You live here, or on the Calm."

22:51:36 You say to Eli, "Yes, both."

22:51:38 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles at Tara Flores.

22:51:49 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Tara Flores. "Very well then, Tara."

22:51:50 You chuckle at Tara Flores.

22:52:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'll make sure you're out safely first, Eli."

22:52:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

22:52:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But.. but.. my stuff!"

22:52:24 A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the steaming beverage.

22:52:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...maybe."

22:52:39 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, I feel so loveed."

22:52:44 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Nothing says protection like a blue buddy to avoid being blue balled by a pink-haired white skinned psychopath."

22:52:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Good, I'm glad."

22:53:17 You say, "I have an apartment in both places."

22:53:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Lexie, you're a nut."

22:53:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you.

22:53:36 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If all existence twere bounded in a nutshell."

22:53:46 You say, "Be right back."

22:53:47 Tara seems thoughtful "I need to get an apartment, How much do pilot apartments cost?"

22:53:48 You stand up from a slim and fashionable couch.

22:53:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Still want to get those apartments renovated that I used to live in."

22:55:04 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

22:55:04 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

22:55:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am, yes."

22:55:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, there are plants that affect airlock cycle speed?"

22:55:24 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Haven't really had time to hybridize it, though I have been meaning to make a max drive velocity increase and airlock cycle increase hybrid."

22:55:29 Eli says to Tara, "They varie, there's some that are cheap though. There's an apartment complex three blocks north of the Spaceport if you don't mind living underground. They're nice apartments despite not having a view. There's also the Residential structure in the sector known as The Calm, if you prefer to live on a station."

22:55:46 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll get to it one of these days."

22:55:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ot sure what the cheapest ones are."

22:55:51 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the four-person mule "Lion's Den" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

22:55:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, "No idea, I haven't checked the plants in a while."

22:55:59 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's just when I told people about it, no one seemed interested."

22:56:06 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "It just takes 500 from the speed too. How pleasant."

22:56:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am. Just...every time you mentioned it. I wasn't able to chat about it."

22:56:39 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den" and the four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird" are landed here.

22:57:43 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

22:57:47 You hug Evenia an Eachtrannach.

22:57:47 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Evenia an Eachtrannach's shoulder.

22:57:50 Evenia an Eachtrannach hugs you.

22:57:54 You say to Evenia, "Hi!"

22:57:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's what I was thinking."

22:58:03 Evenia says to you, "Hi."

22:58:09 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa just went into a transparisteel doorway into the pilot lounge.

22:58:59 You say to Evenia, "How have you been?"

22:59:01 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There once was an aspiring young lance, who wanted to hybridize plants, he found a pilot, who was no shrinking violet, and demanded for plants he take off pants."

22:59:17 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Daamn."

22:59:18 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That was good."

22:59:19 Evenia says to you, "We'll catch up sometime soon, we certainly should. I gotta run for now though."

22:59:30 You say, "Ok."

22:59:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Tahnks."

22:59:34 You hug Evenia an Eachtrannach.

22:59:34 Evenia an Eachtrannach hugs you.

22:59:38 Some lights on the four-person light carrier "On The Wings Of A Hummingbird" flash as Evenia an Eachtrannach boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

22:59:39 Fear Sphere the security hoverbot floats after Evenia an Eachtrannach.

22:59:52 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "And for my next trick I'll land without crashing."

23:01:51 [Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]

23:01:52 You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, a polished rosewood bar, and a very large and extraordinarily soft gray and brown shamak fur here.
You can go south and out.

23:01:54 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

23:01:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:01:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:01:57 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:02:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Israel Hope, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:02:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:02:11 The ship is already moving.

23:02:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:02:13 Which sector did you mean?

23:02:13 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

23:02:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:02:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:02:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:02:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:02:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:02:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:02:21 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:02:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:03:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:03:22 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:03:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Israel Hope. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:03:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:03:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:03:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:03:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:03:42 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:04:08 [Starship "Israel Hope"; Airlock]

23:04:08 You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:46:20 
At least three recently active pilots are relaxing at New Earth; Pilot Lounge.

23:46:24 You blink heavily and then doze off.

23:46:33 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chirps quietly as it receives a new notice.

23:46:59 You glance at your communicator's screen.

23:47:00 You have one mail message.

23:47:04 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:47:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:47:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

You quickly grab it off the belt.

23:48:56 Lily, Shule, and Constantine. this is just a request that we codify the maintenance of 777 into something more coherent than whoever sees it gets it since organizationally, that's been a little hit or miss, and somewhat frustrating.
I propose Seas get the accelerators, beacons, and transmitter. Libs will pick up the repair, recharge, and processor.
Of course we can help each other as needed, but those would be the main responsibilities for each org, and will make part allocation simpler.
