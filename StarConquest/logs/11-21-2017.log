01:59 You ask, "Why would we do that?"

01:59 Lily Kaise says, "We were here all laong and even had I been able to rent, I would have just said let's hangout there a few hours and come back because I wasn't going to do that. I just wanted you to see what the rooms are like."

02:00 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:01 You say to Lily, "I used to actually like her, but now I've lost a lot of respect for her."

02:02 Lily Kaise says, "I wrote a note back saying that please don't make assumptions because we were here all along. Heck I think I even passed a couple of them still shopping on the way back here."

02:06 The cold, refreshing brew in this mug has a light golden color, is entertainingly bubbly, and has a clean aftertaste.

02:06 Lily Kaise says, "I also thought I had given Nissi a key to this ship awhile back. Maybe it was Melinda so there was nothing underhanded. It's just amazing how they love to take their assumptions and turn into their own reality. That is what Melinda did and others and they get away with this stuff."

02:07 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Future Crimes"; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Meow the little calico CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a small red insulated cooler here.

02:21 Lily Kaise says, "Still I am quite full."

02:21 You say, "At least you won't starve."

02:21 Lily Kaise says, "Nope."

02:21 You grin.

02:24 Lily Kaise opens a large mesh gym bag.

02:24 Lily Kaise removes an insulated pink cooler from a large mesh gym bag.

02:32 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:33 Lily says to you, "You ready to face the lions and tigers and idiots up there?"

02:33 Lily says to you, "You ready to face the lions and tigers and idiots up there?laugh."

02:33 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "Or put up with the Evenia show."

02:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:34 Lily Kaise says, "I feel sorry for Eli I sure wish he would find a decent woman rather than an ugly Fringe woman like her. I don't see what guys see in her. She isn't a nice person and she certainly isn't pretty."

02:35 Lily Kaise says, "If she was at leat nice, looks wouldn't matter."

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "Also, if she starts up being a station builder martyer, she will get no sympathy from me. She chose to do things the way she does and to mis-manage as she does so."

02:36 Lily Kaise says, "Martyr tht is."

02:40 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:41 You say, "Especially, since she tends to ust play around anyways and will most likely break his heart in the end."

02:41 Lily Kaise asks, "Anyway, you ready to go face them up there?"

02:41  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of slim navy blue linen trousers, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer.

Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

02:41 You are carrying nothing.

02:41 You say, "Sure."

02:41 You stand up from an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it.

02:41 Lily Kaise says, "I'll be good and not spit in Evenia's eye heh."

02:41 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:41 You laugh.

02:41 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:41 You say to Lily, "Yeah, or I'll have to punish you. Just kidding."

02:41 You're already standing.

02:42 Lily Kaise grins.

02:42 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh see you can keep me in line!"

02:42 You laugh.

02:42 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it.

02:43 You sit down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

02:44 Lily Kaise says, "Hello."

02:44 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

02:44 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

02:44 Evenia Callseah says, "Welcome to what appears to be, the napping hour."

02:44 Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

02:44 Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:44 You say, "Ah, sounds fun."

02:45 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Well it appears to be wine time!"

02:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:45 Evenia Callseah grins.

02:45 You grin.

02:45 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh. It's riveting."

02:45 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

02:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:49 Nissi Valdaire says, "Heading home is always the most boring part."

02:49 Evenia Callseah says, "It can be, but I have this problem where I never wanna shut up."

02:51 Johann Schraft walks in.

02:51 Johann Schraft sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

02:51 Johann Schraft yawns.

02:51 Evenia Callseah cheers for Johann Schraft!

02:52 Johann Schraft asks, "How are things?"

02:52 Evenia Callseah shrugs.

02:52 Nissi Valdaire says, "We're lost."

02:52 Evenia Callseah says, "Quiet, which makes me wanna be loud and annoying so it isn't quiet."

02:53 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Oh, better self-destruct then. There's no hope!"

02:53 Nissi Valdaire grins.

02:53 Evenia Callseah says, "Fuck that. Not before I get my aquarium you don't."

02:53 Evenia Callseah grins.

02:55 Evenia Callseah says, "Nah. Things go okay. I got us moving this morning when I woke up. Or today. Or...fuck. earlier. We've had decent speed so far."

02:55 Johann Schraft nods.

02:55 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Good!"

02:55 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Woo I love being lost!"

02:55 Evenia says to Johann, "But you're welcome to go back to bed, I kinda like the feeling of command."

02:55 Lily Kaise exclaims, "The suspeeeeeence!"

02:56 Evenia Callseah giggles.

02:56 Lily Kaise grins.

02:56 Johann Schraft says, "-evenia No worries. I'm probably not up and about for long today."

02:56 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well I have my hoverpallet so i'll be sure to pile it all on there if we're gonna go bye!"

02:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:56 Evenia Callseah grins at Johann Schraft. "Good good, I'll continue to wear my command face then."

02:56 Johann says to Evenia, "Show me your command face."

02:57 Johann Schraft grins.

02:57 Lily Kaise says, "After what happened to Constantine and nissi, I'd grab up asteria and pile everything on there especially the fish and go for it."

02:57 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:57 Evenia looks at Johann, her face resolving into a hardened mask, her eyes almost piercing.

02:57 Johann says to Evenia, "Very good number one."

02:58 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

02:58 Evenia Callseah chuckles.

03:02 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:02 Lily Kaise slides a "Happy" key off of an enameled purple space cat keyring.

03:02 Lily Kaise gives a "Happy" key to Johann Schraft.

03:02 Eli Grey wanders in from below.

03:02 Johann says to Lily, "You do know I've had a happy key for over a year now?"

03:02 Lily Kaise says, "There in case you want to confirm if we're in some sleezy hotel..."

03:02 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:03 Evenia Callseah points at Eli Grey. "Thing."

03:03 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:03 Eli Grey grins.

03:03 Eli Grey gives an empty can to Evenia Callseah.

03:03 Johann says to Lily, "Does Evenia have one? I don't know how up to everything I will be."

03:03 Eli Grey examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

03:03 Eli Grey helps himself to a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

03:03 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Those dudes wouldn't even take my tael!"

03:03 Eli Grey sits down on a traditional round gray zafu.

03:03 Eli Grey grins at Evenia Callseah.

03:04 Evenia Callseah forcefully hurls an empty can at Eli Grey.

03:04 Eli Grey deftly catches it.

03:04 Eli Grey asks, "Do what?"

03:04 Eli Grey asks, "There were people who refused your business?"

03:04 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

03:04 Lily says to Eli, "Those dudes at the desk of the Inn on Feng Wo wouldn't take my tael!"

03:04 Eli Grey blinks.

03:04 Eli Grey says, "So weird."

03:05 Lily Kaise says, "We were just going to get a good shower, hangout and rest a little but we weren't staying over. I also jsut wanted to show Shule tht it is actually a pretty nice place."

03:05 Evenia says to Johann, "Most of the crew probably don't even know that you're gonna be laying pretty low. So they don't know what you arranged. Silly thing."

03:05 Eli Grey says, "It looked pretty nice."

03:05 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:05 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I have stayed there a couple of times."

03:05 Johann says to Evenia, "Oh. You mean gossip hasn't made the rounds? What kind of ship is this?"

03:06 Evenia Callseah chortles.

03:06 Eli Grey glances at Johann Schraft. "Laying low? What did you do now, Johann."

03:06 A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

03:06 Lily says to Eli, "I know that was odd. I hope it's not something with our issues tith mutuality."

03:06 Lily Kaise says, "With that is."

03:06 Lily Kaise says, "I'd doubt it though."

03:06 Johann says to Eli, "I am not feeling great, so unless it relates to the ship, Evenia is in charge."

03:06 Lily Kaise says, "Since you pay in Feng Wo currency."

03:06 Evenia says to Johann, "It's up to you to let people know. I wasn't gonna open my mouth."

03:08 Johann says to Evenia, "Well, now they know. Feel free to spread the gossip."

03:08 Johann Schraft grins.

03:08 Eli Grey says, "Evenia is in charge? Oh great, now she's goign to be unbearable."

03:08 Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:08 Eli Grey snickers.

03:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:09 Johann says to Eli, "Well, the problem with doing things well is people give yo more things to do."

03:09 Eli Grey says, "Probably have us all shoveling debris, even when we don't need to."

03:09 Eli Grey grins at Johann Schraft.

03:09 Johann says to Eli, "The furnace will break eventually."

03:09 Evenia Callseah says into the PA microphone, "As Johann instructed, I am now spreading the gossip. He's not feeling well, so unless it directly relates to Nissi's ship, I'm in charge of the trip. I have now done as Johann asked, and spread it around."

03:09 Lily Kaise says, "Good shule we can hide for the rest of this."

03:10 Eli Grey says, "Yeah,  then she'll be like, "I don't care that it's broken, just shovel it into a corneR!""

03:10 Evenia Callseah shakes her head.

03:11 Evenia Callseah says, "We'll use your blue glow to power the ship. It means we'll have to kill you, but..."

03:11 Evenia Callseah shrugs.

03:11 Eli Grey smirks.

03:12 Evenia Callseah says, "Hey. I totally know how to be in command. Set the trim to 20. Toss out a random heading. And we'll get home eventually. Oh and fuck charge. Who needs that."

03:13 You grin at Lily Kaise.

03:13 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:14 Lily says to you, "Yeah i'm in charge of you! And you are in charge of meh!"

03:14 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:14 Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:14 You laugh.

03:14 Eli Grey chuckles.

03:14 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:14 Lily says to you, "I like it tht you are at least!"

03:14 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:14 I don't understand that.

03:14 You chuckle.

03:15 Lily Kaise exclaims, "But Asteria rules!"

03:15 Lily Kaise grins.

03:15 Lily Kaise says, "I probably should let her go roam."

03:15 Lily Kaise says, "Then she'd end up in somebody's room who doesn't like lizies."

03:15 You grin.

03:16 Lily Kaise says, "Lizzies."

03:16 You say, "And she'll spy on them."

03:16 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

03:16 Evenia Callseah says, "I love that. And they start yelling over the PA, it's great."

03:16 Lily Kaise says, "And bite their toes."

03:16 You laugh.

03:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:16 Eli Grey says, "I just remember waking up with a spider on my face."

03:16 You say, "Oh my."

03:16 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

03:16 You say, "That would not be my favorite way to wake up."

03:17 Lily says to you, "Well when I traded the compressor yesterday I sure was hoping somebody would offer a lizard."

03:17 Evenia Callseah says, "Who was it...The other gray. AEU gray. had an epic flip when there were 2 in his quarters on the last trip. I couldn't stop giggling."

03:17 Evenia Callseah sighs.

03:17 Johann Schraft sighs. "I want a lizard.'"

03:17 You nod to Lily Kaise. "That would have been cool."

03:17 Lily Kaise says, "Haha."

03:17 Evenia Callseah says, "They're both AEU grays..."

03:17 Lily Kaise says, "Well the other Gray will flip out over most anything."

03:17 Evenia Callseah nods.

03:17 Eli Grey nods. "Yeah that AEU Gray."

03:17 You chuckle.

03:17 Evenia Callseah says, "It was great though. He was all screaming over the pa. And I was almost on the deck. Laughing."

03:18 Eli Grey says, "And that other Eve, the Fringe one."

03:18 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Our blue/gray guy is more easy-going!"

03:18 Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.

03:18 You ask, "And the other one is what... Flipping Gray?"

03:18 Eli Grey grins. "I try to be."

03:18 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

03:18 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:18 Eli Grey says, "That's hilarious."

03:18 Evenia Callseah pokes Eli Grey in the ribs!

03:18 Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:18 You laugh.

03:18 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:19 Eli Grey asks, "So Gray's not a big fan of the lizards, huh?"

03:19 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Come on! Don't be shy! There's plenty in this decanter up here."

03:19 You say, "Apparently not."

03:19 Johann Schraft says, "ONly his own."

03:19 Evenia Callseah says, "Well not in his bed, apparently. And of course I made my comments about that too."

03:19 You chuckle.

03:19 Lily Kaise says, "Heh tht does suprise me a little."

03:20 Evenia Callseah says, "All in fun, of course. He's cool."

03:20 Lily Kaise says, "I thought he might find them kind of cool."

03:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:20 "She's like come on!" Evenia Callseah grins. "Let me go wander and scare people."

03:20 You grin.

03:21 You say, "I wish I could do that."

03:21 You say, "Wander and scare people."

03:21 Lily Kaise says, "You know when I first saw them, I was a little taken aback but I dunno. They grow on you. I wouldn't give up Asteria for anything. I feel proud that I was able to trade for her and I also feel I rescued her as her little ribs were literally showing when I got her."

03:21 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:21 You say, "And she needs a sibling."

03:21 Lily says to you, "I know!"

03:22 Lily says to you, "I tried earlier! I thought my compressor would win!"

03:22 Evenia Callseah says, "I do love how Mel shares Zeus with me. That means the universe to me. We call it the joint lizard custody arrangement."

03:23 Lily Kaise says, "But yeah I did get Asteria with an artifact detector and I think that is how Melinda got Zeus so I dunno... maybe that along with certain trade goods is the thing."

03:23 Eli Grey says, "Does anyone even know how much tael you would get for a lizard? I can only assume that no one has ever actually taken that step."

03:23 Lily Kaise says, "No idea I sotped the trade and didn't go farther."

03:23 Evenia Callseah says, "Fuck that! If I got a lizard in my hands, you bet your ass I wouldn't continue trading."

03:23 Lily Kaise says, "Stopped."

03:23 Lily Kaise says, "When they put down the cage, it was all over for me."

03:23 Johann Schraft asks, "The other question is has anybody ever hatched their space dragon egg?"

03:24 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

03:24 Evenia Callseah says, "I don't think so. Fling some plasma at one and..."

03:24 Eli Grey says, "Maybe that's where that big space dragon came from in A14."

03:24 Lily Kaise says, "No idea as I didn't get any and I gave Nicolette shit for taking hers as I was terrified of them."

03:24 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:24 Evenia Callseah says, "I would love one though."

03:25 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:25 Eli Grey asks, "Would you ride around on it, wearing a spacesuit?"

03:25 Lily Kaise asks, "But I know hmm I think Keegan had one and Caesar had one and whom else?"

03:25 Evenia Callseah says, "Sure. With huge fuckoff wings on my back."

03:25 Johann Schraft says, "Yes."

03:25 Evenia Callseah says, "Um. I think Nicolette gave hers to...I can't think of her name. either way that couple has 2 now."

03:26 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:26 Johann Schraft asks, "Has anybody ever tried trading tael for a lizard?"

03:26 Eli Grey nods to Johann Schraft. "Yeah, I was just wondering htat."

03:26 Evenia Callseah says, "No, but fuck I would if it would work."

03:26 Eli Grey says, "Like, I'm sure you could just be like I've got good tael for a tardic lizard!""

03:29 Johann Schraft says, "I am sad, I only got four tael for an artifact detector though."

03:29 Sean Sloan walks in from below.

03:29 Sean Sloan sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

03:29 Evenia Callseah pokes Sean Sloan in the ribs!

03:29 Johann Schraft nods to Sean Sloan.

03:29 Sean Sloan wriggles his fingers.

03:30 Eli Grey points at Sean Sloan. "It's a Sean thing."

03:30 Evenia Callseah says, "I managed 8 for that compressor, but that trade took a while."

03:30 Sean Sloan glances at Evenia Callseah.

03:30 Evenia Callseah glares at Sean Sloan.

03:30 Sean Sloan tickles Evenia Callseah!

03:30 Sean Sloan snickers.

03:30 Eli Grey asks, "Is that more than what you would have gotten at say, Andy's?"

03:30 Evenia Callseah nods.

03:30 Evenia Callseah says, "For sure."

03:30 Johann Schraft says, "No."

03:30 Lily Kaise says, "Yep I got I think 8 and a silver tael and some additional it was a pretty long trade."

03:30 Johann Schraft says, "Not for me."

03:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:31 Johann Schraft says, "Or last time I traded at Tom Town I think the detector went for six tael."

03:31 Evenia Callseah says, "It was interesting though, my onboard beacon went for less than 3."

03:31 Johann Schraft says, "Then three went to Nathaniel's fine."

03:31 Lily Kaise says, "I've only gotten about 4 max for a detector except for Asteria so who knows what the final outcome would have been."

03:31 Evenia Callseah says, "But at tom town. It was an onboard beacon that went for like 7 tael. And detector for 4."

03:32 Johann Schraft says, "I would trade a lizard though for that bumpercar."

03:32 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:32 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah that bumper car looks cool!"

03:32 Eli Grey asks, "I know right?"

03:32 Lily Kaise grins.

03:32 Lily Kaise finishes off a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

03:32 You grin.

03:32 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:33 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well it did feel good to do a big trade. I haven't traded in a long long time so it was fine!"

03:33 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:33 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:33 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. I enjoy long trades."

03:34 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

03:34 Lily Kaise says, "Oo love that."

03:35 Sean Sloan asks, "So we heading home or stopping at Andy's?"

03:35 Evenia Callseah says, "I hadn't got that far yet. We only launched like 6 hours ago."

03:35 Eli Grey pats Evenia Callseah on the back. "We need a decision."

03:35 Evenia Callseah chuckles.

03:36 Evenia Callseah says, "I think it depends on nissi. If Nissi wants to charge up we will, if not..."

03:36 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm okay either way."

03:37 Eli Grey sighs at Evenia Callseah. "That's just Nissi being in charge."

03:37 Eli Grey snickers.

03:37 Evenia Callseah sighs at Eli Grey.

03:37 Evenia Callseah says, "Well it's her ship, nutball."

03:37 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

03:38 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

03:38 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean. If Nissi wants to fly us right into the middle of a black hole. I would politely say fuck that and abandon ship. But I'd not stop her."

03:41 Eli Grey says, "If you abandon ship, you'll never meet the lovely black hole people."

03:41 Eli Grey says, "They just sorta look like squish. Everything looks like squish in the black hole."

03:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:43 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:48 Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:53 Evenia Callseah pulls out a small key and pushes it into an indigo leather messenger bag's lock.

03:53 Evenia Callseah opens an indigo leather messenger bag.

03:53 Evenia Callseah removes a clear plastic food storage container from an indigo leather messenger bag.

03:53 Evenia Callseah opens a clear plastic food storage container and the light inside clicks on.

03:54 Evenia Callseah removes some snake meat on a stick from a clear plastic food storage container.

03:54 Evenia Callseah closes a clear plastic food storage container.

03:54 Evenia Callseah puts a clear plastic food storage container in an indigo leather messenger bag.

03:54 Evenia Callseah closes an indigo leather messenger bag.

03:54 Evenia Callseah turns a small key in the lock of an indigo leather messenger bag and then pockets the key.

03:54 Evenia Callseah pulls a cube of juicy well-cooked flesh from some snake meat on a stick and pops it into her mouth.

03:54 Johann Schraft yawns.

03:55 Evenia Callseah grins at Johann Schraft.

03:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:55 Evenia Callseah bares her teeth and tears a small browned chunk of meat from some snake meat on a stick, chewing it with gusto.

03:55 Johann Schraft says, "Goodnight Everyone."

03:55 Johann Schraft stands up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

03:55 Evenia says to Johann, "Rest well. Feel better."

03:55 Johann Schraft smiles at Evenia Callseah.

03:55 Johann Schraft walks northeast.

03:56 I don't see that here.

03:56 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Rest well Johann."

03:57 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker: Sleepily says, "Thanks."

03:57 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Nite."

04:01 "Now it's harder to pick on someone." Evenia Callseah sighs. "He's an easy target."

04:01 Evenia Callseah glances at Sean Sloan.

04:01 Evenia says to Sean, "I take that back, you're still awake."

04:02 Evenia Callseah slides a large chunk from some snake meat on a stick, pops it into her mouth, and slowly chews it.

04:03 Evenia Callseah sets her teeth into a chunk of meat on some snake meat on a stick, rips it away from the skewer, and eats it.

04:07 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

04:07 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:08 Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Thing!"

04:08 Lily Kaise says, "Beep beep."

04:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:08 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:08 A readout shows Nebular Signature 5333-1065 about 4.71 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Northwest and Very Slightly Down.

04:08 Eli Grey says, "Thing."

04:08 Eli points wildly.

04:08 Evenia Callseah grins at Eli Grey. "You were so so late."

04:08 Eli Grey says, "It's a new thing too."

04:08 Eli Grey sighs.

04:09 Evenia Callseah says, "I think we're gonna get plenty from this trip already without images."

04:09 Evenia Callseah grins.

04:09 Eli Grey says, "Don't forget probes and spectroscopy."

04:09 Eli Grey chuckles.

04:09 Eli Grey says, "But yeah, you are right."

04:09 Evenia Callseah pokes Eli Grey in the ribs!

04:10 Evenia says to Eli, "I can't help it that you like shooting huge science missiles into un-knowing areas of interest."

04:10 Eli Grey says, "We must destroy the Unknowledge."

04:10 Evenia Callseah giggles.

04:14 Evenia Callseah carefully puts some snake meat on a stick lengthwise into her mouth, lightly closes her teeth over it, and draws the stick away, relieving it of its last chunk of meat and then tossing the bare skewer away.

04:18 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

04:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:24 Evenia Callseah stands up from a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered gold dragons.

04:24 Evenia Callseah strides down.

04:24 Evenia Callseah strides in from below.

04:25 Evenia Callseah sits down on a silky indigo cushion decorated with embroidered gold dragons.

04:25 Eli Grey blinks.

04:25 Eli Grey gives an empty can to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:25 Eli Grey takes a sip of a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

04:25 Evenia Callseah blinks at Eli Grey.

04:25 Eli Grey blinks and flaps his arms at Evenia Callseah and blinks.

04:26 Eli Grey says, "Bye bye unknown thing."

04:26 Evenia Callseah laughs.

04:28 Evenia says to Eli, "You just looked like some weird electronic broken bird."

04:28 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

04:28 Eli Grey gasps. "Oh no, my secret."

04:29 Eli Grey says, "I'm really several rautines in a suit."

04:29 Evenia Callseah giggles.

04:29 Evenia says to Eli, "Show us your faces then."

04:30 Eli Grey says, "Well.. ok..."

04:30 Eli Grey pulls up a long-sleeved shirt of steel gray synthcotton, pulls up a stretchy dark blue top with long sleeves, and exposes his wide bare chest and small dark nipples for a moment.

04:31 Evenia Callseah gasps.

04:31 Evenia Callseah says, "Okay. Those are scary faces."

04:32 You say, "Well, think it's time for me to head to bed. Night all."

04:32 You stand up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

04:32 Evenia says to you, "Rest well."

04:32 You say, "Thanks."

04:32 You wave.

Hey guys feels good to return after leaving during the middle of the AEU plotline due to the stress it was causing. I needed to step away because I was allowing in game stress to affect my health out of character and was having chest and arm pains. The doctors did discover a abnormal heart beat but it feels good to return.
