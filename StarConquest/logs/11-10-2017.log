00:48 The vacuum of space seems oddly peaceful now that it surrounds you. It is not deep black as you expected, but seems to be filled with a diffuse glow. Stars glint all around you, stunningly bright and sharp with no atmosphere or vacuum-protected glass to distort their light. A wide smear of stars fills one area of the sky, pointing the way Coreward.

04:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:23 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

04:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

04:23 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."

04:23 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:23 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:23 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

04:23 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:23 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:23 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

04:23 There are no other ships in the sector.

04:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:24 You begin the docking sequence.

04:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

04:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

05:06 [Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Is there a way to check remaining ammo left in cargo? "Cargo" just shows weight, which isn't crazy useful."

05:06 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes, go to the store room and look at the box."

05:06 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "The ammunition box."

05:10 [Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "What is 'max engine speed' on main battery? You'd think it's what it says, but mine has a max speed of 4000, and I was going 5500 a second ago."

05:11 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Max engine speed on the main battery is the starting speed of the engine, well better put."

05:11 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Better put, the lower of the engine's starting speed, and the main battery's max speed will be the starting speed, as you move a great enough distance you'll accelerate to the max engine speed on the engine itself."

05:11 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right and it will depend on the engine you have installed as well as the battery/Charger."

05:11 [Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Thanks much."

05:13 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

07:19 [Newbie Help] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "What is the command to use the hypercaster? I'm in a room supposedly with a hypercaster, but when I type hypercaster and a message I get an error that says I don't understand that. Do I need a certain amount of points?"

07:20 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Type hyper status to see what it's commands are, and it's hyper transmit or hyper tra to transmit."

07:20 [Newbie Help] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "No, that doesn't work either, but the room commands lists hypercaster as one of them."

07:21 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Tr hyper maybe?"

07:21 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ah, I follow now. Check the ships status to see if there indeed is a hypercaster."

07:21 [Newbie Help] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "I'm not on a ship. I'm at the recharge station."

A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

17:42 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

17:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
