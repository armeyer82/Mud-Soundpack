00:00 Clarina Taylor says, "Right."

00:00 Hawthorn Dunn glances down at his watch momentarily.

00:00 Clarina Taylor glides south.

00:00 Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "Off we go!"

00:00 "All right, kids, let's make history." Jim points a finger skyward and circles it around a few times.

00:00 Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

00:00 Ryan Thomas says, "Cheers."

00:00 Lily Kaise grins at Jim Gruffudd.

00:00 Wendy Arroyo says, "I think the docking bay door is straight ahead."

00:00 Melinda says to Jim, "Pierre says he does not know where we are meeting. Is it good to tell him over alliance?"

00:00 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

00:00 Ryan Thomas roams south.

00:00 Jim Gruffudd nods to Melinda Michaels.

00:00 Nissi Valdaire says, "All right! We're good."

00:00 Kani Kahakai gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

00:01 Wendy Arroyo says, "Dibs on umbilical duty."

00:01 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

00:01 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "We will meet at Farport."

00:01 Wendy Arroyo says, "I have prepared all my life for this."

00:01 Nissi says to Melinda, "Ready to go when they are."

00:01 Melinda says to Wendy, "For umbilicals?"

00:01 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "See you there."

00:01 Wendy Arroyo nods.

00:01 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is anyone able to make me an improved engineering toolset and for how much?"

00:01 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Yes."

00:01 Kani Kahakai says, "Very advanced extension cord."

00:01 Wendy Arroyo says, "This is the culmination of my career."

00:01 Melinda Michaels says, "Good to go."

00:01 Nissi Valdaire nods.

00:01 Nissi Valdaire uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Blackwing Yalobusha, you are given undock clearance under the League-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:02 Wendy Arroyo says, "There will be no higher point that plugging that thing in."

00:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:02 Nissi Valdaire presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:02 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes" has jumped out of the sector.

00:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

00:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:02 Lily Kaise pushes a button on her camera, and the flash goes off.

00:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:02 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:02 Nissi Valdaire presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:02 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Welcome, Blackwing Yalobusha, and all League pilots, friends of the Better Way."

00:02 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Quantum Skim Accelerator to The Cross.

00:02 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:02 Melinda says to Lily, "I will want a copy."

00:02 Kani Kahakai says, "Like plugging in your hyperdimensional stereo."

00:02 Lily Kaise says, "Oh damn I forgot a photo album so I'll cram these somewhere."

00:02 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:02 Nissi Valdaire says, "Here's where somebody realizes they forgot something."

00:02 Nissi Valdaire grins at Lily Kaise.

00:02 Lily Kaise chuckles.

00:02 Melinda Michaels grins.

00:02 Wendy Arroyo says, "I left the oven on."

00:02 Via general sector communication, Zéro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Gonna dock At Farport to recharge that FTL drain."

00:03 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:03 You feel the ship shudder slightly as it approaches a quantum skim accelerator.

00:03 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

00:03 The computer announces, "Initiating connection with The Cross's local quantum skim accelerator network."

00:03 Nissi Valdaire presses some buttons on the communication board.

00:03 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "okay, same"

00:03 Lily Kaise says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Yes abandon!"

00:03 Keying her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, Lily Kaise laughs.

00:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "Almost 26 cycles though, not bad."

00:03 The computer announces, "Connection established. Communicating between quantum skim acceleration gates now."

00:03 Wendy Arroyo says, "That's almost a real number."

00:03 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/General.

00:03 The computer reports that the four-person explorer "Free Trader N-85" has left the sector via quantum skim.

00:04 The computer reports that the four-person explorer "Free Trader E-35" has left the sector via quantum skim.

00:04 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initializing in five seconds."

00:04 The computer announces, "Four."

00:04 The computer announces, "Three."

00:04 The computer announces, "Two."

00:04 The computer announces, "One."

00:04 The computer announces, "Skim subroutine initialized."

00:04 You feel the deck underneath you shudder violently, and you stumble slightly.

00:04 The shuddering finally settles down.

00:04 The computer announces, "Skim initialization complete."

00:04 Wendy Arroyo says, "Watch Katina halt everything to go save Jack."

00:04 Lily Kaise says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Oh sby all means! Stay out of trouble unless it's fun!"

00:04 Melinda Michaels asks, "Save Jack?"

00:04 Lily Kaise says, "Oopsy."

00:05 Wendy Arroyo says, "He's stuck some place."

00:05 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

00:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

00:05 Lily Kaise says, "Forgot the skim it's been so long since i've come acrosss."

00:05 Wendy Arroyo says, "Stuck but not really."

00:05 Gonzales Bourne asks, "Did Evenia stay behind?"

00:05 Melinda Michaels says, "She was on the other ship last I knew."

00:05 Gonzales Bourne nods.

00:05 Gonzales Bourne says, "Gotcha."

00:05 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

00:06 Lily says to Melinda, "Did constantine find a roommate?"

00:06 Melinda says to Lily, "I think so."

00:06 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

00:06 Kani Kahakai says into her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "You either!"

00:07 A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:07 Melinda Michaels carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Zeus from her shoulder.

00:07 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

00:07 Melinda says to a Tardick lizard named Zeus, "Aww."

00:07 Kani Kahakai says, "I might be in a... little bit of a catty mood."

00:07 Melinda says to Kani, "Something happen?"

00:07 Kani says to Melinda, "The usual."

00:07 Nissi Valdaire says, "What's happening."

00:07 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:07 The computer announces, "Skim complete; starship has arrived at journey destination."

00:07 Nissi Valdaire presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

00:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Farport. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector W-62."

00:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:08 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:08 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Farport."

00:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Kani Kahakai says, "Elaine said to not die or start a war."

00:08 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

00:08 Via general sector communication, Farport Station transmits, "Welcome, Blackwing Yalobusha, and all League pilots, friends of the Better Way."

00:08 Nissi Valdaire presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

00:08 Nissi Valdaire trips over Wendy Arroyo as she attempts to work with a nearby control panel.

00:08 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Farport Station.

00:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:08 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes" has docked with Farport Station.

00:08 Lily Kaise says into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator, "What I tried to say before we Skimmed was: oh by all means! Stay out of trouble unless it's fun!"

00:08 Wendy Arroyo says, "Twelve people and seven robots in a two-by-two room."

00:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah sounds like Elaine's more likely to."

00:08 Lily Kaise asks, "Whuh?"

00:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:08 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah."

00:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Greetings, Blackwing Yalobusha. The Mutuality welcome you to this free port."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:08 Kani Kahakai says, "Why I said, 'you either'"

00:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:09 Nissi Valdaire nods.

00:09 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Life will surely continue!"

00:09 Nissi Valdaire says, "Charged in 11 mincycles. This is truly the most exciting moment of our journey."

00:09 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Was the turnoffable turned off?"

00:09 Nissi Valdaire nods.

00:09 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Won't take long."

00:10 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Packed lunch? Fed the beasts? Stocked the ship?"

00:10 Nissi Valdaire says, "Why are you giving me a checklist NOW."

00:10 Nissi Valdaire says, "The felo have 96% of a dispenser."

00:10 Melinda says to Nissi, "Did you shut down weapons and repairs?"

00:10 Nissi Valdaire nods to Melinda Michaels.

00:10 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Did you shut down life support?"

00:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "I did not."

00:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:11 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Yes."

00:11 Wendy Arroyo says, "We could save precious charge by forfeiting all breathable air."

00:11 Melinda says to Nissi, "Pierre was asking."

00:11 Nissi Valdaire nods.

00:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "I figure we stretch it while we can."

00:12 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

00:12 Wendy says to Nissi, "Don't forget to get Melinda off the ship and conveniently undock."

00:13 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

00:13 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

00:13 Battlesuit Information:

00:13 
Active Battlesuit: EAOS Conjurer (Tier 4, Attacker) [the aerial fortress and deployment station "Fort Chambly"]
Stored:            Fringe Huscarl (Tier 4) [New Earth]

                   AEU Combat Universalist (Tier 5) [New Earth]

You have a total of seven battlesuit slots.

00:14 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:14 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "It's been Wendy's life goal to attach an umbilical cord to something so, if you don't mind for her to do it?"

00:14 Nissi Valdaire uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Blackwing Yalobusha, you have clearance to launch. Your allies the Mutuality wish you farewell."

00:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
Melinda Michaels grins at Wendy Arroyo.

00:14 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:14 Wendy Arroyo says, "Tell him he does mind, I'll kill him in one on one combat."

00:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:15 Wendy Arroyo says, "I'm gonna throttle him with the umbilical."

00:15 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:15 Melinda says to Wendy, "Go for it."

00:15 Wendy Arroyo presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:15 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes" has launched from Farport Station.

00:15 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "We're losing precious seconds!"

00:15 Wendy Arroyo says, "Maybe when he feels like un- woo."

00:15 Wendy Arroyo presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:15 Nissi Valdaire says, "Oh, there."

00:15 Wendy Arroyo strides out.

00:15 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

00:15 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to blue.

00:15 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to yellow.

00:15 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to red.

00:15 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:15 Via general sector communication, Zéro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Put it in."

00:15 Nissi Valdaire presses some buttons on the communication board.

00:15 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "working on it"

00:16 Melinda Michaels presses some buttons on the communication board.

00:16 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "that's what she said"

00:16 The computer announces, "Rift link formed with Zéro Des Cartes."

00:16 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

00:16 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:16 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

00:16 A small light on the airlock door turns from red to yellow.

00:16 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to blue.

00:16 A small light on the airlock door turns from blue to green.

00:16 The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh, nice we have access to this in the observation as well."

00:16 Wendy Arroyo just entered the ship.

00:16 Wendy Arroyo says, "I'm gonna need at least three medals for that."

00:16 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes."

00:16 Nissi Valdaire says, "Fourteen crew aboard! Off we go."

00:17 Nissi Valdaire flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

00:17 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:17 The voice of Ather Jammoa comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Keegan, where is Keegan!?"

00:17 Melinda Michaels gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

00:17 Melinda Michaels glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

00:17 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:17 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:17 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:17 Nissi Valdaire activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

00:17 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

00:17 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

00:17 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

00:17 Nissi Valdaire says, "And that's it."

00:17 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

00:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:17 Melinda Michaels settles a Tardick lizard named Zeus on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

00:17 Melinda Michaels gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

00:17 Lily Kaise says, "So what are the general controls? I did put one on my platform."

00:18 Nissi Valdaire says, "Gotta physically grab an umbilical and cart it over to the other ship, like on a spacewalk."

00:18 Lily Kaise nods.

00:18 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "So, what is latest informations related to heading and distance?"

00:18 Wendy Arroyo says, "No carts are involved."

00:18 Lily Kaise grins.

00:18 Nissi Valdaire says, "Then the lead ship just does as normal and the linked one goes with it."

00:18 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

00:19 Lily Kaise asks, "What's the button to communicate with the tethered ship?"

00:19 Nissi Valdaire says, "Rift comm."

00:19 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Uh huh I should have looked for that!"

00:19 Lily Kaise grins at Nissi Valdaire.

00:19 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

00:19 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well this is the heading! Distance is still what we heard before. I assume."

00:20 Wendy Arroyo activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

00:20 Wendy Arroyo accidentally slams her shoulder into Jim Gruffudd as she attempts to work with the long range scanner controls.

00:20 Melinda Michaels says, "Whoops."

00:21 Wendy Arroyo says, "Sorry! Probably."

00:21 Jim rubs his shoulder. "I've had worse."

00:21 Wendy Arroyo says, "A busy control room always has victims."

00:22 Melinda puts her hands in her pockets.

00:22 Jim glances over the rift controls, then nods. "A little different from back in my heyday, but I'd say we're looking good. I'll go break out the stuff you're all so excited for."

00:22 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

00:22 Jim Gruffudd walks south.

00:22 Wendy Arroyo says, "Uniforrrrmssss."

00:22 Lily Kaise says, "I think i'll go to the Observation Room."

00:22 Lily Kaise glides south.

00:22 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters after Lily Kaise.

00:23 Kani Kahakai says, "Ooooh."

00:23 Kani Kahakai says, "Commemorative swag."

00:23 Melinda Michaels grins.

00:23 Wendy Arroyo says, "I became a pilot solely for the loot."

00:23 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok pizzas in the Galley they're still pretty warm and obviously fresh and breadsticks. Enjoy them while they are fresh!"

00:23 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Thanks."

00:24 Kani Kahakai says, "I cannot eat fourty pizzas."

00:24 Wendy Arroyo says, "But we have pizza ovens."

00:24 Kani Kahakai says, "I would explode."

00:24 Kani makes a little gesture, splaying her fingers outward and upward, as if demonstrating the process.

00:24 Melinda Michaels grins at Kani Kahakai.

00:25 Nissi Valdaire says, "Ooh pizza."

00:25 Kani Kahakai says, "Famous, or infamous, Lily pizza."

00:25 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

00:25 A known beacon appears to be 4.23 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Down.
A temporary beacon appears to be 4.23 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Eastnortheast and Very Slightly Down.

00:25 Melinda Michaels stands up from an oval charcoal gray area rug.

00:25 Wendy Arroyo leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:25 The voice of Wendy Arroyo comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey, don't you people feel our control boards are starting to have more microphones than buttons?"

00:25 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:25 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes."

00:26 Melinda Michaels strides south.

00:26 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "All the microphones."

00:26 Wendy Arroyo says, "So we have the PA, but also the external speakers, then let's say the general comms which are technically text but eh, also hypercasts and the comms."

00:27 Wendy Arroyo strides south.

00:27 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah. At least four in here."

00:27 Wendy Arroyo strides in from the south.

00:27 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So, now that we've set out, you're all officially on the Jim Gruffudd First Contact Initiative Expedition TEAM! We got you all a cap and a uniform. You can find them down in the docking bay."

00:28 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

00:28 I don't understand that.

00:28 You're already standing.

03:05 Clarina Taylor sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:07 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We are moving ever closer to jib territory."

03:07 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:07 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Jibtown, population Pierre."

03:07 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And it is sad, that I can not jib-jab from here."

03:14 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:14 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I can."

03:14 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I am pouting, Mel."

03:14 Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:14 The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "She can do everything. I tell you, everything."

03:14 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:14 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not quite."

03:15 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

03:21 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "What we need, is a little rift shoot that travels along this cord, so someone can send me a hot chocolate."

03:21 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:21 Lily Kaise says, "Wow no beverage dispenser over there. Sad times."

03:21 Hawthorn says to Melinda, "So have you guys gotten a chance to speak to Casen?"

03:21 Melinda Michaels points at a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow.

03:22 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:22 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We could maybe send you a pillow."

03:22 I see no "casen" here.

03:23 Lily says to Hawthorn, "She did very well with repairs with her little Tier 1."

03:23 Lily Kaise grins.

03:23 There appear to be about 19 pilots recently active.

Additionally, there are 13 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 32 pilots.

03:23 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

03:23 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

03:23 Melinda says to Hawthorn, "Yes, she visited us in the lounge the night that, seemingly, you and Cat were both trying to get to know her."

03:24 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Yeah. She's real cool. I invited her to breakfast. Had an interesting talk."

03:24 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Apparently she's an Heiress, or was one? Makes me look even more poor than I already am though."

03:24 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:27 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Yeah, Cat and I... I don't think we're gonna work out. She's too, I don't know."

03:27 Hawthorn Dunn sighs.

03:27 Nissi Valdaire says, "Too what."

03:28 Melinda Michaels cuddles up to Kani Kahakai.

03:29 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "I don't know. Forward? Maybe?"

03:29 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Too, aggressive."

03:29 Hawthorn Dunn says, "She seems aggressive."

03:29 Hawthorn Dunn nods.

03:29 Melinda Michaels grins.

03:29 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

03:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "Oh."

03:29 Hawthorn jumps.

03:30 Hawthorn Dunn mutters. "Rift has me paranoid all the damn time."

03:30 Melinda Michaels says, "I thought it was cute watching y'all and that girl."

03:30 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:32 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I wanna ask her out? But I dunno, she's...not in my league I guess."

03:32 Hawthorn Dunn shrugs.

03:32 Hawthorn Dunn says, "And i'm not gonna like duel over her with Cat that's weird."

03:33 Ryan Thomas shrugs.

03:33 Ryan Thomas says, "I think you're out of her league, personally."

03:33 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Casen?"

03:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Just cause someone comes money, doesn't mean they're above another person."

03:33 Hawthorn makes an uncomfortable sort of face, but he nods to Melinda.

03:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just means they were born lucky most of the time."

03:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

03:36 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well, I dunno. Casen seems intelligent and she's great at conversation so, Maybe."

03:39 Ryan Thomas says, "I don't think I've met Casen yet."

03:39 Nissi Valdaire says, "Me either."

03:44 Melinda Michaels says, "I've met her twice, seems nice enough."

03:44 Melinda Michaels says, "But dunno."

03:44 Lily Kaise says, "She's a very hard worker no doubt and I've enjoyed interacting with her. We've invited her to join SEAS but I don't think she had fullfilled her required time as a pilot at that time."

03:46 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well, mostly can I get along with her is my thing. You know? Like I'd hate to go out with someone only to be like we can't stand each other."

03:46 Lily Kaise says, "She interacts with Constantine and us regularly."

03:46 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:47 Lily Kaise says, "Well guess you have to just ask her out and then see how well things go from there."

03:47 Lily Kaise smiles.

03:47 You say, "Yep."

03:48 You say, "I thought I was going to get killed if I tried to flirt with my current significant other yet I'm still alive. If you want to make an omelet got to break a couple eggs."

03:48 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Uh shule!"

03:48 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:48 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:49 Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.

03:49 I don't understand that.

03:49 Melinda Michaels says, "He was afraid to flirt."

03:49 Lily Kaise says, "That sounded... just so wrong..."

03:49 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:49 You laugh.

03:49 Melinda Michaels says, "It was cute."

03:49 Lily Kaise tickles you!

03:49 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well, I guess it's worth a try."

03:49 Nissi Valdaire grins.

03:49 You say to Lily, "I was just saying it was a risk for me to flirt with you."

03:49 Lily says to Hawthorn, "Of course it is."

03:50 You say to Hawthorn, "You'll never know if you never try."

03:50 Lily Kaise grins at you. "I know... just the comparison heh."

03:50 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

03:53 Hawthorn purses his lips in thought before he shrugs, nodding.

03:53 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

03:56 Hawthorn Dunn yawns.

03:57 Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

03:57 Nissi Valdaire takes a bite of a serving of hot macaroni and cheese in a shallow bowl.

03:57 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay I'll be up in a few... hours? cycles? what are we using for time?"

03:57 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Things!"

03:57 Melinda Michaels says into the PA microphone, "Hours, cycles, whatever."

03:57 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Rest well."

03:58 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay!"

04:01 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

04:01 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

04:01 Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

04:01 Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:01 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.
Melinda Michaels strides south.

04:02 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

04:02 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

04:03 Lily Kaise takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:03 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:03 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "A little speed."

04:03 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

04:03 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'm sure you could squeeze just a little more."

04:03 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:03 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Jibbly joobles."

04:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:04 You chuckle.

04:12 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

04:22 Clarina Taylor scrambles to her feet.

04:22 Clarina Taylor glides east.

04:22 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:22 Clarina Taylor glides in from the east.

04:23 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:23 Lily Kaise gives you a slice of three-meat pizza.

04:23 Lily Kaise glides east.

04:24 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

04:24 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:24 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

04:24 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:24 Lily Kaise takes a bite of a breadstick sprinkled with parmesan and romano cheeses.

04:25 Nissi Valdaire takes a bite of a serving of hot macaroni and cheese in a shallow bowl.

04:25 You smile at Lily Kaise. "Thanks."

04:25  You are wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer.

04:28 Tegan the small circular sanitation bot greets Lily with a barrage of cheerful dinging!

04:28 Lily Kaise grins.

04:28 Nissi Valdaire grins.

04:28 Lily Kaise gives a goblet to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:28 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Tegan is such a hoot!"

04:28 I don't understand that.

04:28 Eat what?

04:29 Lily Kaise says, "Well I thik we'll have to disappear into our quarters for a couple of cycles soon."

04:29 Nissi Valdaire strokes Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lovingly.

04:30 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:30 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll be awake awhile."

04:30 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

04:30 Lily Kaise says, "Wish I oculd stay up and keep you company like a long time ago."

04:31 Melinda Michaels says, "I'll be fine."

04:31 Lily Kaise says, "But you've got Kani and Clari and a couple of dozers."

04:31 Lily Kaise grins.

04:31 You grin.

04:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Clari and a couple sleepy people."

04:32 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Fore]

04:32 You can go north, east, south, west, and up.

04:32 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Mid]

04:32 You see a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and orange aquatic life and coral rocks here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

04:33 Lily Kaise looks at you thoughtfully.

04:33 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:33 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]

04:33 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.

04:56 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:57 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:57 You say to Lily, "Night my love."

04:57 Lily says to you, "Nite Hun."

05:04 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

05:06 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

05:16 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

05:25 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

05:25 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

05:31 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

05:34 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Howdy piloty type folks."

05:34 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo."

05:52 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

06:02 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

06:09 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

06:14 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Ryan."

06:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

06:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:19 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

06:24 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

06:26 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

06:26 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

06:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:36 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

06:37 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

06:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:51 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:02 Multicolored fish flakes drop from above and float on the surface. The fish eagerly gobble them up.

07:04 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:14 The neon green plastic plant slowly undulates.

07:15 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:26 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

07:27 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

07:28 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

07:28 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

07:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

07:37 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

07:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

07:47 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

07:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:57 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

08:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:06 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

08:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:16 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

08:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:26 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

08:29 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

08:29 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

08:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:35 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hoping the drive breaks soon-ish."

08:35 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh?"

08:35 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We can check our course while stopped."

08:36 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We haven't gone that far. Were we given instructions on how often we should check?"

08:36 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No, we were just told Ian will be on call day and night to do it whenever we stop."

08:36 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

08:37 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

08:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:50 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

08:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:31 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

10:33 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

10:33 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

10:38 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

11:29 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

11:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

11:33 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

11:33 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

11:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:48 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

11:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:35 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

12:35 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

13:00 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

13:05 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

13:13 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

13:23 A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

13:34 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

13:36 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

14:23 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

14:33 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

14:38 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

14:38 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

14:49 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

15:08 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

15:39 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

15:45 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

16:41 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

16:41 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

17:05 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

18:11 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

20:13 Ali Candan strides south.

20:15 A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

20:25 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

20:46 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

20:46 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "That the drive or is that the uh, rift."

20:46 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

20:47 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

21:05 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Hm."

21:05 Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

21:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

21:27 A strange-looking starship approaches from behind, being lifted and placed by a giant hand one square at a time. It advances a few spaces beyond your ship and stops.

21:45 The ship lands on a square marked "Roll Again!" Dice roll, and the ship advances another few squares.

21:48 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

21:49 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

21:52 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

21:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:14 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not yet, but I said at least one would break in the next hour."

22:14 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:14 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:14 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Please don't kidnap Tegan."
