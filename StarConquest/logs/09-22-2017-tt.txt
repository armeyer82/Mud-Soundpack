Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.

waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved white top with a colorful butterfly
print, a pair of skinny stonewashed purple lowrise jeans with amethyst and deep
purple jeweled seashells on the front pockets, and a pair of white leather clogs
with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange
and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring
inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and

because of this."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, I'm pleased to announce that thus
far in the liaison term, the Union is responsible for 0 of 14 destroyed RATs
nests and 0 of 12 salvage ops, representing an impressive 0% contribution by our
corps. Unfortunately, we were responsible for 3 of 143 beacon drops and 22 of
333 asteroids hauled, representing 2.1% and 6.61% total contributions,
respectively. These are rookie numbers! I know we can bring these down! [00:38

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "This

all or nothing. No one is going to blame you for working."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "If
you actually want the Union to remain in the Accord, your best option honestly
is to join us in the strike. Otherwise, you're basically working counter the
rest of us and tacetly supporting the withdrawal."

join in on the strike?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, if you want
to do that, just don't do any work."

to sector invasions, but that's basically it."

pirates and rats out of places like Orion, maybe? But don't turn any rats cores
in."

sit around a flight scanner and sit waiting and watching?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know it
doesn't sound that great. But every one of chipping in on it helps."

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

everything in a rich golden glow, and the booths are padded and comfortable. The
walls are decorated with countless replicas of old flags and yellowing paper
maps of Earth's various countries. A tiny holovid nestled at the far edge of

Greetings pilots. It appears that earlier today, B-19 fell under attack from The

civilian pilots did respond to the attack with a pulsar. Thank you to those who
responded to defend AEU alliance space. Now, having said that, I would like to
just offer a friendly reminder to watch out for the Navy in instances like that.
Unfortunately, my reports showed that an AEU pulsar did fire on the navy. Just
be mindful of what your weapons are locking on to. Other than that, keep it up
and defending human alliance space is still extremely important. Take care and
