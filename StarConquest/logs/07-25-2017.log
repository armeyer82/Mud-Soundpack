Starships possess a few minor amenities to make long trips bearable!

SHIP'S HEAD

First of all, are you out in deep space and you really need to "go"? Never fear! All starships have a ship's head! It's conveniently located in the storage room, simply because there is no good place to put such a thing.

Ship's heads also possess a first aid kit for use in emergencies. These are kept stocked automatically by alliance spaceports.

LIVING QUARTERS

Living quarters are the center of most amenities, logically! Living quarters are typically found on larger ships, and tend to be centrally attached to a "hub" room. This hub will possess a tiny, single shower that you can GO into. It has the usual START and STOP commands.

Also in the hub, you may CLAIM a living quarters if you have a key to the ship. This will lock a living quarters so that only you may enter it! If you wish to give up your room, you may UNCLAIM it later.

If you own the ship, you may OVERRIDE a living quarters lock from the hub in order to forcibly unclaim it.

Once inside the living quarters, you may ALLOW anyone you brought with you to also be able to get past the lock. If you change your mind, you can DISALLOW a person.

00:26:06 You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

00:26:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:26:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:26:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:26:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:26:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:26:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:26:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:26:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:26:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

00:26:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:26:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:26:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:37:12 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:37:14 You peer out...

00:37:14 
[Space Station "Helios"; Docking Bay Alpha]
The outer end of this large interior docking bay is ringed with bright white docking lights and red and yellow warning stripes. The walls are dark grey metal, scarred and burned in places, but recessed into them and apparently fully functional are the automated systems that assist starship launching, docking, and transport into the garage below. A hatch-like entryway leads east into the station.
The four-person light carrier "Kalina" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a trash can here.
You can go east.

00:37:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:37:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have been given clearance to undock.

00:37:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:37:31 The starship is already moving.

00:37:33 The starship is already moving.

00:37:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:54:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:54:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:54:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:54:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:54:39 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:54:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:54:41 I can't find "couch."

00:54:42 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Madder Lake Deep". The organization has earned 831,017.58 credits.

00:54:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:54:45 I don't understand that.

00:54:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:54:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:54:47 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:54:47 I can't find "couch."

00:54:47 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:54:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:54:50 You sit down on a tiger stripe leather sofa.

00:54:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:54:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:54:51 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:54:54 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Kalina! Welcome to home space!"

00:55:10 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 269" has jumped out of the sector.

00:55:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalina. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

00:55:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:56:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:56:09 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:56:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:25:44 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

01:26:05 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And I am no fan of the king of spin. I feel quite used by Best and am very unhappy. I went looking for answers since I felt like I might be correct in my theory or hypothesis depending on how you see it and it wound up making me look quite bad."

01:26:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "I can't right now but if I can sneak into old Frontier before it closes, I may try so if you think you need a separate ship, then take us back to the torus to get one or whatever you prefer Love."

01:26:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

01:43:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "I normally tend to keep my mouth shut, but from where I'm standing, everyone's right about you, and I don't even know you."

01:44:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, Vernos. From what I heard, Lily never mentioned your name or referred to you directly in her last transmission. So, to call her names over the General channel when she didn't even address you by name..."

01:44:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Shule we both are not that stupid as to pretend we do not know who she was referring to, are we."

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

01:46:37 
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

So, whether or not you like it, you represent the pilot corps or you are supposed to. To me, it is innbefitting of a Voice to be name calling over public channels like you just did."

03:10:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah and i've heard it's a good idea to find out what's illegal to have in one's cargo hold in certain territories. That is the part which intimmidates me as heh somebody would tag me most likely."

03:11:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "If it were me, I would tag you. However, I'd wager, and probably win that wager, that 99% of other pilots would not."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and a pair of leather thong sandals with a white flowered print here.

11:45:15 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

11:45:16 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

11:46:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

11:46:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:46:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:46:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:46:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:46:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

11:46:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:46:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:46:26 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

11:46:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:46:27 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

11:46:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:46:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:46:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:46:32 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:29:31 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:29:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.

13:07:52 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

13:07:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:07:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:07:55 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

13:07:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:07:56 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

13:10:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

13:10:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:10:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:10:43 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:11:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:11:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:21:05 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

14:22:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:22:14 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

14:22:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

14:22:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:22:24 The ship is already moving.

14:22:26 The ship is already moving.

14:22:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:22:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:22:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:22:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

14:22:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:22:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:22:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:22:34 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

You can go south and out.

14:26:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:26:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:26:46 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:26:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

14:26:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:26:57 The ship is already moving.

14:27:01 The ship is already moving.

14:27:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:27:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:27:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:27:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

14:27:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:27:08 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

14:27:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:27:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:27:10 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Jump sequence aborted."

14:27:10 Which sector did you mean?

14:27:10 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

14:27:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:27:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:27:12 Via general sector communication, Beacon C-09 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Kalina.' Welcome to The Dusty Reaches."

14:27:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

14:27:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:27:16 There are no other ships in the sector.

14:27:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:27:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:27:19 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
I don't understand that.

14:27:20 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

14:27:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:27:21 I don't understand that.

14:27:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:27:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:27:24 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Kalina! Welcome to The Torus!"

14:27:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Beta).

14:27:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:28:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:28:05 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

14:28:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Kalina. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

14:28:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

14:28:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

14:28:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:43:24 [Starship "Tornado"; Control Room]

14:43:25 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Kalina"; Docking Bay.

14:48:51 This is an orbital marketplace, connected to others like it through a series of wormhole shunts. These same wormholes are the reason such marketplaces are not allowed to operate on planets or large space stations. A computer interface provides access to buying and selling on the marketplace, and a large chute underneath it allows items to emerge as they are delivered via wormhole.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is parked here.
You can go southeast, south, and southwest.

14:48:53 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

14:48:56 I don't understand that.

14:48:58 Board what?

14:48:59 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

14:49:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

14:49:01 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

14:49:02 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

14:49:03 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

17:02:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "How's it going Constantine?"

17:04:30 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

17:04:30 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a new notice.

17:04:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well then."

17:04:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's okay. My eyes kind of hurt from exhaustion."

17:04:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah good luck with that."

17:05:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How about you?"

17:05:13 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "So he'll be spending the credits either way."

17:05:20 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Maybe."

17:05:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably all gonna go in his cousin's pocket."

17:05:46 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Bets on just how long it'll take for him to get started on that? 5 years?"

17:07:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It doesn't matter. He'll either cut corners and we'll end up with shitty warships. Or He'll do as promised and we'll end up with a whole fleet of powerful warships that will still be useless if the Outsiders come and we have to face them alone."

17:08:13 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Eli, if the AEU were attacked, and the other alliances offered help, would he take it?"

17:08:23 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Will he expect someone with PDB shielding to come to the rescue?"

17:09:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know, but even if he did, we won't be organized and in sync with everyone. It'll be a disster for everyone."

17:09:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Now.. if you are talking about civilian pilot help, then sure I doubt the help will be declined."

17:09:56 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

17:12:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not especially."

17:13:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, for the most part it won't. But the Outsiders are smart. They'll likely know that Union worlds are a sitting a duck. You guys might have time to rally a defense while.. well, I'm not gonna say that part."

17:14:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I mean. I've always gotten the impression that the outsiders, if they really cared to, could destroy us all anyways."

17:15:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The only thing really holding them back,  is simple ignorance on certain issues."

17:15:50 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Maybe those issues will no longer be a concern once we become divided."

17:16:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The union being defenseless, at least, doesn't get them any closer to finding those things out."

17:16:27 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Tis true."

17:21:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Tran also, I just have to make one more point. And then I'll give it a rest for now, it's too early for this shit."

17:22:43 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "3 for cruiser beacons?"

17:23:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whoever said our warships and Navy weren't mighty already? Do you guys scoff when you see a squadron of stolen pirate ones?"

17:23:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Has anyone ever said, "Oh, nevermind. It's just a Soothsayer? Or a Pulsar?""

17:24:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not that pirates have Soothsayer, thank the gods. But still."

17:25:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They may not be the most powerful warships in the galaxy, but they're hardly anything to scoff at."

17:26:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And so... The time has come... For coffee."

17:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So yep, we're gonna throw money at our enemies. Lovely."

17:31:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or was that just in response to my comment."

17:31:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm good, just groaning about Best."

17:31:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that."

17:35:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He acts like the Accord's made slaves outta the AEU. What a joke."

17:36:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd love to see him develop a PDB shield all on his lonesome."

17:36:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's a PDB shield? A couple people have said that."

17:38:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The PDB, is the Outsider super weapon that destroyed Grenwold, and MIR station."

17:38:42 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 2,611,111.11 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person hammerhead "ERROR: SHIP NAME NOT FOUND".

17:39:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's the phase destabilizing beam. The shield for it is on the Percival Lowell. The only ship that can really withstand a shot from it."

17:39:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, I've read about that."

17:40:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, a dreadful weapon that can destroy world's. This was the main point I addressed on the broadcast."

17:44:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This is also why it's ridiculous that Best is claiming Grenwold was never a planet that got destroyed. The destruction of Grenwold was what allowed the aliens to find the location of resistance headquarters, resulting in the death of Benjamin Masterson mere moments later."

17:44:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's a well documented part of human history."

17:44:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

17:46:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did Eve ever show back up? She was unusually absent last night."

17:46:51 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Don't think so."

17:47:21 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "But then I wasn't around much last night meself."

17:47:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Like when? She was with you I thought?"

17:47:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Saw both of ya parked on the Torus at the same time anyhow. So figured she was with you."

17:48:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, I ended up just being in the League lounge the whole night."

17:48:29 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's a cosy lounge."

17:48:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...no? You were at the Torus. Remember, you saw me there?"

17:48:46 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I use to nap in there."

17:49:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was only there to pick up some stuff for Sir Goldenpants, and Itook a nap there."

17:50:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah. Well her ship was there too. And since the person I was talkin to said they'd been talkin to both of you, I figured you had both been there."

17:50:35 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And she was on comms not long before that."

17:50:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So she ain't disappeared or nothin. Was round maybe six this morning if not since then."

17:51:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right on. It's not really a big deal."

19:42:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just saw that ship leaving the Torus."

19:43:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh and I have decided unless something changes between now and the end of term. I will not be running to keep the office of voice and would like to see Constantine hold it."

19:44:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I've already tried threatening to resign, they basically jerked off to the message."

20:01:23 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Now we need a repair or if someone else wants to bring an EAOS, I can bring my AEU."

20:01:29 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'll lead in a Junkbot if that's cool."

20:01:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fine by me."

20:02:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And the appointed place of departure shall be?"

20:03:33 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Glad she has it all figured out, I don't remember ever threatening the League with public exposure but did voice to the league voice that governments do work hard to cover things up."

20:05:30 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I didn't get a copy of the letter, but if you wanna try to put my word against yours at this point, I think I'll be happy with how that turns out."

20:05:42 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Yeah, it can repair a little. Not like an AEU."

20:05:59 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No I said bring me the proof, I do not remember this part of the letter."

20:06:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you wrote it, didn't you keep a copy?"

20:06:31 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I wouldn't trust an alleged copy of that letter coming from Vernos anyway."

20:07:01 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I'll try to get a copy if you really want, Vernos, but I would suggest against it. I think you're remembering it in a too forgiving light. It's not a good look for you."

20:07:02 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No I didnt but I will be happy to request a copy if possible from the AEU to go along with the one you produce."

20:07:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wait. You sent a letter addressed to Wellington to the AEU? How does that work?"

20:08:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Actually Nissi, would you mind bringing your EAOS? I don't want to get us all blown up, so I'd prefer to have an AEU repairing."

20:08:19 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Please we all know alliances heavly inspect our mail as we send it."

20:08:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The AEU does that?"

20:08:34 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I thought somebody else was gonna take an AEU. RATS would replace EAOS, not AEU."

20:08:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

20:08:52 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whichever you like then. I'll bring my AEU."

20:08:57 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Okay!"

20:09:52 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Either way I would like to see this letter. Its not painting a favorable light, its more of I do not remember."

20:10:18 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will own up to it if I read it."

20:11:11 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Okay then, I'll put the request through our voice when I'm done fighting bugs in a ventilation system."

20:11:37 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "New Earth you said?"

20:13:05 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No need to, this is off the beaten trrack."

20:13:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah ok."

20:13:21 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "And I think this ship can outrun them. Or at least it seemed like it could."

20:13:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Most I've seen is 24. Fortunately I didn't have to tangle with 'em."

20:13:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm glad she has me all figured out.I did not want the voice job this way, I did not want either of you rogued."

22:14:34 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "As I said, I'll read it and eat the crow as needed."

22:14:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Might wanna go buy somethin to wash it down."

22:14:52 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It must be awful to be losing your memory."

22:22:35 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay I can see how this might seem as if a threat to the League government."

22:23:29 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You didn't realize this when you wrote it?"

22:23:32 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Camp."

22:23:55 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well, it was not intended to be a threat so no, I did not consider it such."

22:24:46 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "So far it looks like a camp then."

22:25:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Do you have more than us three?"

22:27:15 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Whatever you want bruh."

22:27:28 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Fair enough."

22:27:29 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "As far as Aisling goes, I called her departure suspectous in regards to the timing of it and the headlines because of the hard time she ad getting them and can certainly see how my wording would imply the mutuality cooperates with the pirates."

22:29:11 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Hey, news flash! No wait, it would be wasted breath to try to explain this to you."

22:31:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there still a spot in the camp?"

22:31:08 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Sure."

22:33:12 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What do you want Cheri. I worded a letter extremely badly. Made it sound like the mutuality actively works with pirates and that I was threatening the League....I did it, I have to live with it and accept it. Outside of that I am trying to work on moving forward and working on actions instead of jjust throwing words around."

22:34:06 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Were you coming Constantine?"

22:34:06 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm also not expecting instant grafication or forgiveness."

22:34:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm almost there, sorry."

22:34:27 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "No worries. Just wasn't sure if you were coming in the first place."

22:34:33 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Stop throwing words around."

22:34:45 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "The solution was already given to you."

22:36:24 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will say thank you to Nissi for providing the copy."

22:37:00 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Yeah, turns out I wasn't lying after all, huh. Who'd have guessed?"

22:37:09 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Never said you were."

22:38:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Now this will be the only joke I ever make regarding the matter."

22:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And this folks is why Ather writes the letters and not me."

22:38:42 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Just heavily implied."

22:40:15 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You should be investigated."

22:40:42 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay what would you like me investigated for, writing a terribly worded letter?"

22:41:25 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There's a difference between badly worded and heavily veiled threats."

22:41:35 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No threat was intended."

22:41:53 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Actively conspiring to tamper with Mutuality and League relations."

22:41:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It was pretty clearly a threat. How ya didn't mean it as such is beyond me."

22:42:36 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You were already given a means by which you can fix things, take it or leave it."

22:45:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "For sanity's sake. I am so tired of all this. I could scream. Vernos. Just do whatever it is they have asked of you to fix things. And accept that people are going to be mad for a good long time. And you won't be forgiven in a hurry. I am not trying to be harsh here. But there are way. Bigger things that the AEU needs to be worried about than this. Like the accord situation. I have said my piece. And I am now staying out of this."

22:45:34 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So Vernos, what do you think of pilots aiding unregs?"

22:46:29 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "As I admitted to morris, if my family was in trouble I would have gone to help them myself."

22:47:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Ah, your family are unregs?"

22:47:30 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No but if they were I would help them."

22:47:53 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "If they were, you'd not be an AEU pilot.."

22:48:08 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Your words are meaningless."

22:48:27 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Only meaningless if you sit there and nitpick at everyone one of them."

22:48:55 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I questioned them in the context of a complete sentence that you came up with."

22:49:04 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So how do you feel about AEU pilots aiding unregs?"

22:49:12 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No you tried to invalidate my words."

22:49:21 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm done with you. Straight answers are not forthcoming. Hide the truth behind diversion all you like."

22:49:57 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Cheri, the law is a stupid law but is a law if that makes sense."

22:50:07 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "How do you feel about it?"

22:50:57 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I don't agree with the law but it exists. I cant say its not a law or be unreasonably expected not to ahere to it."

22:51:44 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That being said."

22:51:55 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I didn't ask about the law, I asked how you feel about the act of aiding unregs."

22:54:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Unregistered people are human, and human lives are important. The act in itself in AEU space is illegal but in that being said. I personally agree with aiding unregs since they are in fact humanity."

22:54:20 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Unregistered people are human, and human lives are important. The act in itself in AEU space is illegal but in that being said. I personally agree with aiding unregs since they are in fact humanity."

22:54:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Miscomm but yeah."
