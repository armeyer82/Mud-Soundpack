00:52 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:52 Nissi Valdaire just entered the ship.

00:53 Nissi Valdaire quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

00:53 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 255.0, -2.0.

00:53 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a dark purple leather captain's chair.

00:53 Nissi Valdaire grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

00:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:53 Nissi Valdaire begins the launch sequence.

00:53 A launch trajectory is located.

00:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:53 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am sensing a strong flow of power."

00:53 Nissi Valdaire activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

00:53 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Power!"

00:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:53 Nissi Valdaire flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

00:53 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:53 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

00:53 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am now sensing a loud roar."

00:53 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:53 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:53 The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:54 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

00:54 Lily Kaise sits down on a black leather sectional sofa.

00:54 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How far is it?"

00:54 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Ather you're being more cooperative than I'd ever imagine!"

00:55 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just like your maternal figure."

00:55 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "I think around 21 lTC."

00:55 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Shush."

00:55 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Thank the stars I am not yo mama."

00:55 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:55 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, cause I'd have already offed myself!"

00:56 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:56 Nissi Valdaire says into the PA microphone, "21 and a half. We should be there by noontime or so if this speed keeps up."

00:56 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nice."

00:56 Nissi Valdaire glances down at her wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

00:56 Nissi Valdaire says into the PA microphone, "Well more like afternoon."

00:56 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We are slowing down."

00:56 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We have slowed down 6 mincycles already!"

00:56 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it's not bad."

00:56 Nissi Valdaire says into the PA microphone, "You heard Ather, he's responsible for us slowing down."

00:56 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Heis!"

00:56 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Plug him in. WE need more power!"

00:56 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I confess."

00:56 Ted Warburton's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let's push him out then."

00:57 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Athere get out there and storm!"

00:57 Lily Kaise says, "Well this has een an interesting experience. I htink I am good for a week at a time but I wasn't going to go back early."

00:57 Nissi Valdaire grins.

00:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "A good run to do once in a while."

00:58 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah and away from the stuff back there."

00:58 Nissi Valdaire nods.

00:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "I'm gonna go sit."

00:59 Nissi Valdaire stands up from a dark purple leather captain's chair.

00:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "In the loungey place that is."

00:59 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:00 [Starship "Future Crimes"; Main Deck]

Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:00 You follow Lily Kaise up.

01:01 Nissi Valdaire says, "I looked all around the station. Checked the scanner one last time."

01:01 Lily Kaise places you on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:01 Nissi Valdaire says, "If they're hiding on some other station for some reason, fuck em."

01:01 Lily Kaise sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

01:01 Johann Schraft says, "I didn't check the others though."

01:01 Ted Warburton laughs.

01:01 Johann Schraft nods.

01:01 Johann Schraft says, "My thoughts exactly."

01:01 Nissi Valdaire takes a larger bite of a Caramel Fusion Bar. A strand of caramel briefly dangles and then attaches itself stickily to her chin.

01:01 Ather Jammoa says, "I actulaly use to cmap out on the broadcastor statio a lot, because I tended to lrscan before I went artifacting."

01:01 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

01:01 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:01 Ted Warburton says, "I'd just do a rundown on the lounge station and then a scan when I was up there."

01:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:02 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Lounge station can't lrscan!"

01:02 Ather Jammoa says, "And I couldn't get the lrscanner for the runabout, relations and skim gates and things."

01:02 Ted Warburton says, "That's why I did that when I was up there, not in the lounge."

01:02 Bryan Stout chuckles.

01:02 Lily Kaise nods.

01:02 Ted Warburton says, "Ah, crap, yeah."

01:02 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I've had mine awhile but I doubt I bothered to put it on mine."

01:02 Ather Jammoa says, "I would've loved to bring my arrow, but it would've been too big."

01:03 Lily Kaise nods.

01:03 Eli Grey says, "I thought there were several still out when I checked last, but I didn't check when I came back because Johann was casting anyways."

01:03 Johann Schraft says, "Yep, we were pretty full."

01:03 Johann Schraft says, "Yeah, Lily and Bryan I think were the last two."

01:03 Lily Kaise says, "I counted like three of us die-hards so I think three returned."

01:03 Ted Warburton finishes off a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake.

01:03 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Actually, Eli came after me!"

01:04 Lily Kaise says, "I just let mine charge a little."

01:07 Nissi Valdaire says, "This feels very slow after two days of capsule speeds."

01:07 Johann Schraft grins.

01:07 Johann Schraft says, "I'm not surprised."

01:07 Eli Grey chuckles. "I bet."

01:07 Ted Warburton says, "Yeah, I bet."

01:10 Damien Alexander says, "Gonna lie down for a while."

01:10 Eli Grey nods.

01:10 Ted Warburton says, "Later."

01:10 Eli Grey says, "Rest well."

01:11 Damien Alexander waves.

01:11 Damien Alexander tramps southwest.

01:11 Eli rubs his face tiredly, "I might do the same."

01:11 Eli Grey finishes off a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake.

01:11 Ted says to Nissi, "You want us all in quarters, or is on our ships OK?"

01:12 Lily Kaise says, "Glad I have Living Quarters in Happy at elast."

01:12 Ted Warburton says, "I've made my storage room into a bedroom, complete with double bed and shower."

01:13 Eli Grey grins.

01:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:13 Lily Kaise says, "Yup that's how I used to fly."

01:13 Lily Kaise says, "I put the shower in the head."

01:13 Ted Warburton says, "That sounds a bit cramped."

01:13 Eli Grey says, "Yep, turn any room into a living quarters with the wonder of furniture."

01:13 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

01:13 Ted Warburton nods.

01:14 Eli Grey says, "Alright, later folks."

01:14 Ted Warburton says, "Later."

01:14 Eli Grey wanders west.

01:16 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Woo! On the way we go to Feng wo! Woo!"

01:16 Ted Warburton says, "Yep."

01:16 Lily Kaise says, "I'm so happy for Shule as he's never been."

01:17 Johann Schraft says, "I have not either."

01:17 Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

01:17 Johann Schraft says, "And neither has Evenia."

01:17 Ted Warburton says, "I'm really surprised, I wasn't expecting to be there twice so soon."

01:17 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well you have to experience it at least one time!"

01:17 Johann Schraft nods.

01:17 Johann says to Sean, "Have you been there?"

01:18 Sean Sloan says, "Twice now."

01:18 Ted Warburton says, "We'll all be nice and hungry when we get there, my god, the food."

01:18 Lily Kaise says, "I want to pick up some things for Katie. I think she had probably been on her own back here while all of us were gone."

01:19 Nissi Valdaire pops the last bite of a Caramel Fusion Bar into her mouth, then she spends a moment trying to pick sticky caramel from her chin.

01:21 Sean Sloan says, "Think the last time we were loking for franklyn."

01:22 Lily Kaise nods.

01:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:23 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I hadn't been to Feng Wo in well over a year and so last time I went, I thought I'd probably not get to go again unless I could bring a crew so it's always welcomed!"

01:23 Ted Warburton says, "It sure is."

01:23 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

01:24 Lily Kaise disbands her group.

01:24 Ted Warburton says, "If someone will chart, I'll happily bring more people over when I get my platform."

01:27 Lily Kaise says, "Or was that Cats."

01:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "That got moved from here to my galleon I think, just in time for my imperator to become my expedition ship."

01:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "Along with skeeball."

01:29 Lily Kaise nods.

01:29 Lily Kaise says, "Oh right."

01:29 Johann Schraft grins.

18:57 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

18:57 [Starship "Future Crimes"; Living Quarters Block]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a small gaming table, a rattan floor lamp with a sage green lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a small sea green trash bin, a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it, a soft square cream rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick silver fringe, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a large sandy brown floor pillow, a traditional round gray zafu, a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, a small oval sea green rattan table with a glass top, a robotic chef named Nellie, Manx the little calico CatBot, a round saffron orange zafu with a white strap, and a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" here.
Evenia Callseah is sleeping on a large sandy brown floor pillow. Alko Delovega is 
18:57 sleeping on a soft square cream rug.
Aisling the Fox is dozing on a round saffron orange zafu. Nissi Valdaire, Ali Candan, and Ather Jammoa are dozing on a black leather sectional sofa. Nicolette Lawrence, Lily Kaise, and Bryan Stout are sitting on a black leather sectional sofa. Eli Grey is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.
(You are sitting on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.)

18:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

19:02 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

19:03 Eli Grey takes a bite of a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake.

19:06 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

19:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:10 You wave to Eli Grey.

19:12 Evenia Callseah suddenly awakens.

19:12 You wave to Evenia Callseah.

19:12 Evenia nods sleepily, reaching to make herself coffee.

19:13 Evenia Callseah closes an indigo leather messenger bag.

19:13 Evenia Callseah turns a small key in the lock of an indigo leather messenger bag and then pockets the key.

19:13 Evenia Callseah examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.

19:13 Evenia Callseah helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.

19:14 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

19:15 Evenia glances over a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa", chuckling.

19:15 Evenia Callseah says, "The detail in that is just..."

19:16 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

19:20 a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa"

19:20 This is a letter. It is not addressed. You recognise the handwriting as belonging to Ather Jammoa.

19:20 --

19:20 Feng wo is 9.67 LTC galactic southwest and slightly down from the last charting, which was when the ship was last stopped at a time or other that might be 15:50. Heading and things adjusted slightly.
--

19:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:25 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

19:25 Eli Grey finishes off a large slice of cinnamon crumb coffee cake.

19:25 Eli says to Evenia, "Good morning weird Evenia thing."

19:25 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

19:26 Evenia says to Eli, "Good morning weird Eli thing."

19:27 Evenia Callseah points at Eli Grey.

19:27 Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings and arches both eyebrows in apparent incredulity.

19:28 Evenia glances at Eli and whispers. "Thing."

19:28 Lily Kaise smirks.

19:28 Nicolette Lawrence sighs.

19:28 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Not another day of this."

19:28 Evenia Callseah laughs.

19:28 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:28 You chuckle.

19:28 Eli says to Nicolette, "A day? Yo'uve got a much longer trip than that ahead of you."

19:28 Eli cackles madly.

19:28 Evenia says to Nicolette, "Well he isn't flapping yet."

19:29 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I was like... I did sleep in as I totally burned out on little sleep these and thought oh nos I probably missed Feng Wo! past 12 or so days."

19:30 Evenia Callseah says, "I totally didn't mean to crash out right here. It was not a good sleep."

19:30 You grin at Lily Kaise.

19:30 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

19:30 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I think that snail hting moves at a faster pace!"

19:30 You say to Lily, "You didn't."

19:30 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, someone throw a harness on Crawley, he'll get us there."

19:30 Lily says to you, "Yeah I saw, I felt the paaaain!"

19:30 Evenia Callseah chuckles.

19:30 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:30 You laugh.

19:31 Evenia Callseah says, "I'll just, find that blueprint on my workbench. One snail harness coming right up."

19:31 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.

19:31 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I even had time to sort through fish tanks and change clothes!"

19:31 Eli Grey says, "Oh that reminds me."

19:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

19:32 Eli says to Evenia, "You have a dead aquapede."

19:32 You grin at Lily Kaise.

19:32 Evenia Callseah pouts.

19:32 Evenia says to Eli, "Not the gold one?"

19:32 Nicolette says to Eli, "You didn't eat it?"

19:32 Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

19:32 Eli Grey says, "No, I didn't eat it, I saved it for Eve."

19:32 Nicolette Lawrence asks, "SHe doesn't eat them?"

19:32 Nicolette Lawrence says, "I don't think anyway..."

19:32 Eli Grey says, "Um.. let me go see, I can't remember. I think it was soft blue but that might have been the egg that's in there."

19:33 Evenia Callseah says, "Let me finish this coffee and I'll move and sort that. Moving takes being awake."

19:33 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

19:33 Eli Grey wanders down.

19:33 Eli Grey wanders in from below.

19:33 Eli Grey nods sadly to Evenia "yeah, it's the gold one, sorry.

19:33 Evenia Callseah finishes off a cup of hot black coffee.

19:33 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

19:33 Evenia Callseah gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

19:33 Evenia Callseah pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

19:33 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Just paint one of the others."

19:34 Eli Grey smirks.

19:34 Lily Kaise says, "Lizards will eat fish corpses but I fed Asteria meatdogs and things until they were not edible and then various rations except for the coffeecake today."

19:34 Evenia stands up, flicking her head from side to side with loud cracks.

19:34 Evenia Callseah stands up from a large sandy brown floor pillow.

19:34 Evenia Callseah says, "Oh I know they will. They quite enjoy the corpses."

19:34 Evenia Callseah trudges down.

19:34 Nicolette Lawrence mutters. "DOn't we all."

19:34 Lily Kaise says, "Well I just won't do that unless I don't have anything else areound. It sort of grosses me out."

19:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

19:35 Lily Kaise says, "They will also eat felo treats."

19:35 Ather Jammoa says, "Bah, better to feed the fish corpses to them than let them go to waste."

19:35 Nicolette Lawrence says, "And felo."

19:35 Nicolette Lawrence says, "ANd treats."

19:35 Ather Jammoa says, "I want to see if they will eat felo pets, but no one has yet volunteered their pet."

19:35 Ather Jammoa sighs.

19:35 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well I will not feed them felo!"

19:36 Nicolette says to Ather, "How about other lizards?"

19:36 Ather Jammoa says, "Trying to see if they take an interest in a domesticated felo compared to a virtually wild felo."

19:36 Lily Kaise says, "The corpses well... yeah but I just send them for a final float on homeward."

19:36 Ather hmms.

19:36 Ather says to Nicolette, "That is a pretty genius idea."

19:36 Evenia Callseah trudges in from below.

19:36 Evenia Callseah sits down on a large sandy brown floor pillow.

19:36 Evenia Callseah beams.

19:37 Evenia Callseah says, "I had another gold one, so it's okay."

19:37 Nicolette says to Evenia, "We were just discussing feeding lizards to other lizards."

19:37 Evenia Callseah gasps.

19:37 Ather Jammoa says, "And I'm still hoping someone will give me their pet felo so that I can see if the lizard will eat a domesticated felo compared to a virtulaly wild felo."

19:37 Lily Kaise says, "That is too barbaric for me."

19:38 Evenia says to Ather, "I like you and all, but you are not getting one of my pets. Ask eli."

19:38 Ather says to Eli, "Gimme your pet felo."

19:39 Lily says to you, "I guess Prissy is gone by now."

19:39 Evenia says to Eli, "For the record if you give him the one I breed to look like your color, I'll crush your balls with these boots."

19:39 Ather Jammoa asks, "Man, we haven't even made a full LTC since I charted? Or did the drive break down?"

19:39 Lily Kaise says, "Nope we haven't."

19:39 Ather Jammoa says, "Goodness."

19:40 Ather Jammoa says, "We might as well get everyone to get out and push. We'd go faster than this shit."

19:40 Lily Kaise nods.

19:40 Evenia says to Lily, "I don't wanna think about pets being gone. My oldest pet that I'd had since I was a cadet, is probably gone now. She was old when we left."

19:40 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow I thought you had been here more than a year?"

19:40 Evenia Callseah says, "I have. Over a year and a half."

19:41 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Some last a long time. Some others not so much."

19:41 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

19:41 Ather Jammoa says, "They last longer if you feed them nutrigel."

19:41 Evenia Callseah says, "Got her as a cadet. I wonder if her being armored has something to do with it."

19:41 Evenia Callseah says, "That's what she's had most of her life."

19:41 Lily Kaise says, "None of mine lasted more than about 13 months but yeah I had one which was a violet long-haired named Prissy. I guess she had a couple of weeks left so I am sure she is gone now."

19:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:42 Ather Jammoa nods to Evenia Callseah.

19:42 Lily Kaise says, "I had a couple others who only lived about 7 months as well. That was tough."

19:42 Ather Jammoa says, "Then yeah, not surprised it lived for that long. They usually live longer on nutrigel, cause it's apparently closest to the fruits that they use to eat."

19:42 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Maned don't last long, I've determined this. Ridged don't appear to either."

19:42 Ather Jammoa says, "Love maned felo."

19:42 Lily Kaise says, "Oh well perhaps I'll start getting nutrigel for them."

19:42 Ather Jammoa says, "Best fighters against bari."

19:42 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. That's what I'd heard, and it seems to be true. I can't believe how long she lived."

19:43 Evenia Callseah says, "I love maned. Used to breed them."

19:43 Ather Jammoa nods.

19:43 Ather Jammoa says, "I use to breed them too, back in the day."

19:43 Ather Jammoa says, "The cuts and scrapes were always well worth it."

19:44 Eli Grey says, "I still find it strange that something that is such an efficient predator has a fruit as it's favored food source."

19:44 Ather Jammoa says, "Sometimes when I felt particularly adventurous, and when a non-maned felo was born into the herd, I'd let them tear it apart. Other times, I decided to show mercy."

19:44 "They are." Evenia Callseah grins. "I mean those fuckers jump up and kick you in the face. I respect that."

19:44 Ather says to Eli, "Well."

19:44 Ather says to Eli, "Most of them were never spacebound."

19:45 Ather Jammoa says, "And I still think that the EAOS modified the felo that we're dealing with now."

19:45 Ather Jammoa says, "A lot."

19:45 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

19:45 Evenia Callseah nods.

19:45 Ather Jammoa says, "For one, they have a much shorter lifespan than I remembered."

19:45 Lily Kaise nods.

19:45 Evenia Callseah asks, "You mean the wild ones?"

19:45 Damien Alexander tramps in.

19:45 Ather Jammoa says, "Part of that could be due to their diet, but not all of it."

19:46 Ather Jammoa nods to Evenia Callseah.

19:46 Damien Alexander waves.

19:46 Eli Grey says, "That fruit must be a truly worthy prewave."

19:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. They live maybe...2 weeks all told."

19:46 Eli Grey waves.

19:46 Eli Grey coughs.

19:46 Ather says to Evenia, "Two months tops if you keep them on nutrigel the entire time."

19:46 Evenia Callseah waves.

19:46 Lily Kaise says, "Well all of mine now just get bulk chow since we can still buy it over on the Torus but in a couple of weeks, who knows."

19:46 Evenia says to Ather, "Oh fuck that nonsense. Hard enough to get people together for megapods to feed my pets."

19:47 Damien Alexander asks, "How's things?"

19:47 Evenia Callseah says, "Slow. Very slow."

19:47 Ather Jammoa says, "Hard enough to ge tpeople together for megapod raids regardless. Especially since..6 years later, we're still scouting the thing, because the EAOS are too busy working out how to break into a ship that they've had for almost ten years."

19:47 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Slow."

19:47 Lily Kaise says, "Wow mine only live about a week if they are lucky."

19:47 You wave to Damien Alexander.

19:47 Lily Kaise says, "Maybe two."

19:48 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm gonna need one so damn bad when we get back. I put down 4 dispensers, but still."

19:48 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

19:48 Eli Grey smirks. "At least they might start making some faster progress on that ship with the defense systems down."

19:48 Evenia Callseah nods to Eli Grey.

19:48 Lily says to you, "Guess we'll be running ours too and pumping up the bari killing!"

19:48 Ather says to Eli, "Or something."

19:48 Damien says to Evenia, "Looks like it."

19:48 You nod to Lily Kaise.

19:49 Evenia says to Damien, "And it continues to slow down. We'll thank Ather because he last charted."

19:49 Lily Kaise stands up from a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

19:49 Lily Kaise glides down.

19:49 Ather Jammoa says, "It hasn't been a cakewalk. I know a few folks have been killed trying to get into the thing, and there were serious injurries, too."

19:49 Damien Alexander asks, "How far out are we?"

19:49 Ather Jammoa asks, "But, ten years?"

19:49 Ather Jammoa points at a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa".

19:49 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Drive is still all right too."

19:49 Lily Kaise glides in from below.

19:49 Evenia says to Damien, "About 9 LTC's, last chart."

19:49 Lily Kaise sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

19:50 You smile at Lily Kaise.

19:50 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

19:50 Evenia Callseah says, "At least he didn't throw light-years at us."

19:50 Evenia Callseah grins.

19:50 Eli says to Evenia, "48 lightyears."

19:50 Evenia Callseah looks at Eli Grey and shrugs. "Whatever you say, weird light-year person."

19:50 Eli Grey says, "2 lightdays, 2 lightminutes."

19:51 Damien Alexander glances down at his wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

19:51 Ather says to Eli, "I think you have your lightyears crossed."

19:51 Ather Jammoa says, "You're way off."

19:51 Eli Grey grins. "I was just spouting off random distances to annoy Evenia."

19:51 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh."

19:51 Ather Jammoa nods.

19:51 Ather Jammoa says, "I'm about to say, you're just under 30 lightyears off."

19:51 Evenia Callseah says, "Hate light-years."

19:52 Evenia Callseah glares at Eli Grey.

19:52 Eli says to Evenia, "Lighthours."

19:52 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

19:53 Evenia says to Eli, "Your face is a light-hour."

19:53 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

19:53 Ather says to Eli, "Give me your felo pet so I can see if Skipper will eat it."

19:53 Damien Alexander shakes his head. "I'm too used to LTCs to have any use fer light-years."

19:53 Eli says to Evenia, "Go jump through a hole on Drydock."

19:53 Ather Jammoa says, "If she hasn't gone through the hole on Drydock she's not a good pilot."

19:53 Eli Grey chuckles.

19:54 Eli Grey says, "I didn't bring any of my pets."

19:54 Ather Jammoa says, "All the cool people go through the hole on drydock. It's a right of passage."

19:54 Damien says to Evenia, "I'd come hoover you up if you did."

19:54 Evenia Callseah chuckles.

19:54 Evenia Callseah says, "Of course I did that."

19:54 Evenia Callseah giggles.

19:54 Evenia says to Eli, "Don't let him choose, he'll go for the eli-looking one."

19:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

19:54 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

19:55 Eli Grey says, "The mark of a true explorer. You see a hole and you just think "i just gotta see what's in there""

19:55 Eli Grey grins at Evenia Callseah.

19:55 Evenia Callseah snickers.

19:55 Damien Alexander asks, "Who would what?"

19:55 Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.

19:55 Evenia Callseah says, "Ather wants to feed a pet felo to his lizard to see if it reacts differently or something. I said to eli don't let Ather choose which pet. Because to be a butt, he'd choose the Eli-looking one."

19:56 Ather Jammoa says, "Na, I'd let him choose."

19:57 Damien says to Evenia, "Fancy a game of Trade Cycles?"

19:58 Damien Alexander says, "It's been ages since I've gotten ta play that game."

19:58 Evenia says to Damien, "When I'm a bit more awake and have had at least one more coffee, sure."

19:58 Damien Alexander smiles at Evenia Callseah.

19:59 Evenia says to Eli, "Don't forget to tell metal face down there to feed that aquarium."

19:59 Eli Grey asks, "Yes, but what should he feed it to?"

19:59 Evenia says to Eli, "Gadget. That's it. I always forget his name."

19:59 Evenia Callseah gasps at Eli Grey.

19:59 Eli Grey snickers at Evenia Callseah.

19:59 Evenia says to Eli, "That aquarium was custom built by the torus! Don't even..."

19:59 Eli Grey nods. "I've been making sure he does his job, don't worry."

20:00 Damien says to Evenia, "Ya brought an aquarium?"

20:00 Evenia says to Damien, "Yeah. It always comes with me when I go anywhere. Just one. The one that has every kind of fish in it."

20:01 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:01 Damien says to Evenia, "Did ya get it decorated special, like ya did mine?"

20:01 Evenia Callseah nods.

20:01 Eli says to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, "Tegan, go tack for us."

20:01 Evenia Callseah laughs.

20:01 Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Hi tegan!"

20:01 Tegan the small circular sanitation bot greets Evenia with a barrage of cheerful dinging!

20:01 Evenia Callseah beams.

20:02 Damien Alexander chuckles. "Tegan is funny."

20:02 Evenia Callseah says, "Tegan is awesome. Except for when she ate Eli's rift cup because he stupidly gave it to her."

20:02 Eli Grey sighs. "Poor rift cup."

20:02 "Rift cup?" Damien Alexander arches an eyebrow.

20:02 Evenia says to Eli, "I don't remember the full story of the rift cup."

20:03 "Another me from someplace where I don't have my blue skin, came in and dropped it on an expidition." Eli Grey nods. "He saw me and looked super freaked out and when he vanished, his coffee cup remained."

20:03 Eli Grey says, "Just strolled into observation, like everything was normal."

20:03 Damien Alexander stares at Eli Grey. "Wild."

20:04 Eli Grey sighs. "Then I was using it for a while and gave it to Tegan out of habit when I was finished with my coffee."

20:04 Damien Alexander asks, "I thought Tegan had a compartment, though. You couldn't get it back?"

20:04 Eli Grey shakes his head. "No, I tried."

20:05 Eli Grey shrugs. "I guess it was really just a cup in the end, but it was at least mildly special to me."

20:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

20:06 Damien Alexander says, "Asteria feels yer pain."

20:06 Damien Alexander chuckles.

20:06 Eli Grey grins.

20:06 Eli Grey says, "That little thing that it's in is too adorable."

20:06 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:06 Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

20:06 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

20:07 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

20:07 Evenia Callseah says, "Where is my jib. I'm good with a jib. Let me at it."

20:07 Damien Alexander says, "Jibber jabber."

20:08 Eli Grey smirks. "Jib."

20:08 Nissi Valdaire stretches.

20:08 Evenia Callseah grins at Nissi Valdaire.

20:08 Eli Grey pats Nissi Valdaire on the back. "I like the cut of your jib."

20:08 Evenia Callseah coughs.

20:08 Lily Kaise grins.

20:08 Evenia Callseah says, "Um."

20:08 Evenia Callseah chortles.

20:08 Damien Alexander says, "Don't cut yer jib."

20:08 Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Nissi Valdaire.

20:10 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Are we all on course and stuff?"

20:10 Ather Jammoa points at a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa".

20:10 Evenia Callseah nods.

20:10 Lily Kaise points at Ather Jammoa.

20:10 Lily Kaise exclaims, "He did it!"

20:10 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:10 Nissi Valdaire nods.

20:11 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

20:11 Damien says to Nissi, "Heya."

20:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hi."

20:12 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:12 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow it only took us... what half a cycle to make it to 1 LTC?"

20:12 Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.

20:12 Eli Grey says, "The spiders are catching us. Soon the ship will get stuck and we'll all end up in oval-shaped cocoons. My dad always said this would happen if I became a pilot."

20:13 Lily Kaise says, "Haha."

20:13 Damien says to Eli, "Yer dad said you'd become a cocoon?"

20:13 Evenia Callseah laughs.

20:13 Eli Grey says, ""A pilot?" he said, "do you want to get eaten by interdimensional spiders?""

20:13 Evenia Callseah giggles.

20:13 Damien Alexander chuckles.

20:14 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Well now we know where you get it from anyway."

20:14 Nicolette Lawrence mutters.

20:14 Damien Alexander glances at Nicolette Lawrence and glances at Eli Grey.

20:14 Damien Alexander shrugs.

20:14 Evenia Callseah chuckles. "Here she goes."

20:14 Eli Grey grins at Nicolette Lawrence.

20:15 Eli Grey says, "Nicolette said I'm the martest pilot in the AEU, she told me so."

20:15 Eli Grey says, "Er.. smartest."

20:15 Eli Grey snickers.

20:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

20:15 Damien Alexander laughs.

20:16 Lily Kaise says, "No Vernos is."

20:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:16 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

20:16 Lily Kaise squints.

20:17 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:17 Eli Grey sighs.

20:17 Eli Grey says, "They've almost got us."

20:18 Eli Grey says, "This is still blazing fast compared to the other day."

20:18 Eli Grey shudders.

20:18 Evenia Callseah says, "It's okay. They'll eat the weird-looking ones first. So eli. You're screwed."

20:20 Evenia says to Eli, "I couldn't convert the speed you told me the other day into LTC's. But it would have sucked. Either way."

20:20 Eli Grey says, "Would have been um..."

20:21 Eli Grey asks, "12.5 mincycles per seccycle I think?"

20:21 Evenia Callseah winces.

20:21 Damien Alexander says, "Sanity on a stick, that's slow."

20:21 Evenia Callseah says, "Okay. Fuck that."

20:22 Eli Grey asks, "Because it's like lightminutes times 2.5 or something, right?"

20:22 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:22 Evenia Callseah asks, "I think so?"

20:22 Damien Alexander says, "I use... 7.74 light-years per LTC... or something."

20:23 Damien Alexander says, "Man, it's been a while since I really had to worry about it."

20:23 Evenia Callseah says, "And this is what you get, for not spending the 5 hundred million on that nice little part that would have helped."

20:23 Eli Grey sighs. "I know."

20:23 Damien Alexander laughs.

20:23 Eli Grey says, "If I had known that I couldn't get the turbine and solar panels at the same time, I would have definitely picked it up."

20:24 Damien Alexander says, "I got that on almost all my ships that use the rift."

20:24 Lily Kaise nods.

20:24 Damien Alexander says, "There's one that don't have it. I forget which one."

20:24 Evenia Callseah says, "Ah but you did not do your research, thus you crawled through the rift."

20:24 Evenia Callseah gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

20:24 Eli Grey says, "I tacked for a while, but even that was kinda slow going. I eventually just dropped out and set the ship to vector so I could pass out for the night."

20:24 Evenia says to Damien, "I actually think it's the platform."

20:25 Damien says to Evenia, "Nah, the platform's in LTCs."

20:25 Nicolette says to Eli, "Did you autovector?"

20:25 Eli Grey nods to Nicolette Lawrence.

20:25 Nicolette Lawrence says, "Figures."

20:25 Nicolette mutters and mutters.

20:25 Eli Grey asks, "What's wrong with auto-vector?"

20:25 Eli Grey says, "I figured it would be better than sitting in one spot."

20:25 Damien says to Evenia, "It's one of the ships I don't use too much."

20:25 Evenia says to Damien, "Oh yeah. But I'm talking about that auto tacking upgrade you can buy. Eli didn't put it on the sightseer. Therefore...completely shit speed."

20:25 Nicolette Lawrence says, "It's just weird."

20:25 Damien Alexander exclaims, "Oh!"

20:26 Damien Alexander says, "That's not what I thought you were talkin' about."

20:26 Eli Grey nods. "The impeller."

20:26 Damien Alexander says, "Right, I don't have that."

20:26 Evenia Callseah nods. "That thing. Yeah that."

20:26 Evenia Callseah says, "It's super handy."

20:26 Damien Alexander says, "I thought ya meant the LTC converter thing."

20:26 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Auto tacking?"

20:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:26 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:27 Eli says to Nissi, "Well that's sort of how the tech explains it though I'm not sure it's the most apt description."

20:27 Lily Kaise shrugs.

20:27 Evenia Callseah says, "I meant the impeller. I'm still half-asleep, someone figured it out."

20:27 Nissi Valdaire grins.

20:27 Damien Alexander chuckles.

20:27 Eli Grey says, "I used to always get it, but I never realized how much it was helping me until I didn't have it the other day."

20:28 Evenia Callseah says, "I don't put it on everything, but I do put it on things that are gonna do extended rift travel."

20:28 Eli Grey says, "Pretty sure it can only go on exploration ships."

20:28 Evenia Callseah nods.

20:28 Damien Alexander says, "I don't think any of my ships have that."

20:28 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

20:29 Eli says to Damien, "Just gives you a more garunteed minimum speed. Instead of going 5 LmS the other day, I would have probably been going at least 300 LmS instead."

20:29 Eli Grey says, "Which, is still not super fast, but it's way better than 5."

20:29 Damien Alexander nods to Eli Grey.

20:30 Damien Alexander says, "Could get it on the platform."

20:30 Evenia Callseah says, "I think it's worth having. But I guess we're all different. Like I'm still debating over furnace, or high/low on my carrier, and I can't get straight advice from anyone. Everyone is glad to tell me what's better, or what doesn't work, and then drift off into some conversation about solar panels, but I just want the cold hard facts so I can decide."

20:30 Ather Jammoa says, "Furnace on a carrier would be a disaster."

20:30 Eli Grey asks, "A disaster?"

20:30 Eli Grey asks, "I guess because of the low cargo space?"

20:30 Ather Jammoa says, "You can't get enough debris in there for a full charge without continuously salvaging."

20:30 Damien says to Evenia, "I remember how much of a hit Akemi's science ship's sensors took when she installed the hi-lo on hers."

20:31 Evenia Callseah says, "I think what would help. Is seeing a carrier with a sensor plant. And the high/low before I decide."

20:31 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I have it on my carrier but it also makes it pretty wobbly."

20:31 Eli Grey asks, "Wobbly?"

20:31 Bryan Stout says, "Impeller, I think I put that on my gem."

20:31 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:31 Lily Kaise says, "Still if I need to take stuff a good distance, that's the trade off."

20:31 Bryan Stout says, OOCly, "Please tell me I spelled that right, belatedly."

20:32 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Yeah impeller, it was right."

20:33 Evenia Callseah says, "Well see I'm happy to lose sensors because...It's a carrier, I don't need it to see the space hotdog from 5 LTC's away, but it's one of those decisions you can only make once."

20:34 Ather Jammoa says, "You can certianly make it more than once."

20:34 Bryan Stout says, OOCly, "No, was talking about gemini."

20:34 Lily Kaise says, "Well they're already pretty deaf but yeah."

20:34 Bryan Stout asks, "Can't you take an upgrade off at farport and store it?"

20:34 Ather Jammoa says, "You can take it off anywhere and store it."

20:34 Ather Jammoa says, "Not just farport."

20:34 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh I had no idea!"

20:34 Nicolette Lawrence scrambles to her feet.

20:34 Nicolette Lawrence rolls down.

20:34 Evenia Callseah says, "Well holy fuck."

20:34 Eli Grey asks, "Wait.. what?"

20:34 Bryan Stout says, "Oh."

20:34 Eli Grey asks, "You can store upgrades?"

20:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah no that's nifty."

20:35 Eli looks baffled.

20:35 Bryan Stout nods.

20:35 Ather Jammoa says, "At many upgrade shops."

20:35 Damien Alexander says, "Didn't know that."

20:35 Ather Jammoa says, "It's been something that has been allowed for a few years now."

20:35 Lily says to Ather, "That needs to be put in your book... ahem!"

20:35 Evenia Callseah exclaims, "Well fuck me dead. If I'd known that little piece of information. I wouldn't be debating. I'd be testing!"

20:35 Lily Kaise says, "Me too."

20:35 Ather Jammoa says, "Why the fuck would I put it in the book."

20:35 Damien Alexander says, "Yeah."

20:35 Lily Kaise says, "Because the rest of us had no idea before."

20:36 Eli says to Ather, "Because you absolutely love making new editions of your book, of course."

20:36 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:36 Lily Kaise says, "Right."

20:36 You chuckle at Eli Grey.

20:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "I knew! This carrier's high-low upgrade sits at Farport to this day."

20:36 Ather Jammoa grins at Nissi Valdaire.

20:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:36 Ather Jammoa says, "I think I hvae a sola rpanel upgrade sitting somewhere."

20:37 Damien Alexander says, "Love ta get solar panels on one of my exploration ships."

20:37 Evenia Callseah says, "Well shit. That makes things much easier."

20:37 Eli says to Ather, "What ended up happening with the skim thing? It seemed like things were all ready to go for a bit there."

20:37 Evenia Callseah says, "I don't wanna part with 50 tael."

20:37 Ather Jammoa says, "Disagreements."

20:38 Eli Grey asks, "Oh, because of the vote?"

20:38 Ather Jammoa says, "Na."

20:38 Ather Jammoa says, "The vote passed."

20:38 Eli Grey says, "Oh ok."

20:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

20:40 Evenia Callseah opens a small black leather zip pouch.

20:40 Evenia Callseah removes a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" from a small black leather zip pouch.

20:40 Evenia Callseah begins reading in a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition".

20:41 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

20:41 Eli Grey says, "Hmm.. where's tobias and Sarah? I haven't seen them since we left."

20:41 You say, "I didn't eat them."

20:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe we left them behind."

20:42 Eli Grey looks at Nissi Valdaire thoughtfully.

20:42 Eli Grey says, "Yeah, I guess they're gone forever."

20:42 Nissi Valdaire looks at Eli Grey and shrugs.

20:42 Eli Grey smirks. "I'm pretty sure I saw the ship down there at least."

20:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well the ship's the valuable part. What could we get for those two, some potato wedges? Delicious, but no thanks."

20:43 Eli Grey chuckles.

20:43 Damien Alexander arches an eyebrow.

20:43 Evenia Callseah puts a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" in a small black leather zip pouch.

20:43 Evenia Callseah closes a small black leather zip pouch.

20:43 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

20:43 Nissi Valdaire walks down.

20:43 Nissi Valdaire walks in from below.

20:43 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

20:43 Evenia Callseah sighs. "Keegan needs to fix that book."

20:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "They're aboard, somewhere."

20:45 Eli Grey sighs. "Now I want potato wedges."

20:45 Nissi Valdaire grins.

20:45 Eli Grey says, "And I don't even have any chips left, it's tragic."

20:45 Evenia Callseah says, "An Eli without chippy's is just strange."

20:46 Damien says to Evenia, "So how about that game of Trade Cycles? I'll fetch ya some coffee if ya want."

20:46 Damien Alexander smiles at Evenia Callseah.

21:50 [Starship "Future Crimes"; Living Quarters Block]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

21:53 Evenia Callseah puts a shiny gold plastic paper dispenser in an indigo leather messenger bag.

21:53 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Ugh.. not sure I've ever been on the carriage in the rift.. This is um.. what's the word.."

21:53 Damien Alexander sits down.

21:53 Eli, Fomoir of legend asks, "Harrowing?"

21:53 The carriage bumps heavily over a rock and then arrives back on the road.

21:53 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

21:54 Evenia begins carefully taking notes on a sheet of white paper, glancing at a personal filing computer as she does.

21:54 Evenia Callseah switches on a personal filing computer.

21:58 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "I think we just got through repairing their legs just a few minutes ago."

21:58 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

21:58 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "They should have nice, fresh legs."

21:58 Evenia Callseah grins.

21:58 Evenia Callseah asks, "Exquisite legs?"

22:22 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

22:23 Evenia Callseah says, "Then we smacked our face into this storm, and we stopped crawling."

22:23 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

22:23 Johann Schraft asks, "And repaired twice?"

22:23 Evenia Callseah says, "Once before I slept. And once just recently. Lazy ass."

22:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

22:24 Johann Schraft says, "Artifacting tired me out."

22:28 Evenia Callseah grins at Johann Schraft.

22:29 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods.

22:43 Johann Schraft nods to Damien Alexander.

22:43 Damien Alexander sits down on a black leather sectional sofa with a deep purple throw pillow with thick silver fringe on it.

22:43 Damien Alexander smiles at Johann Schraft. "Heya."

22:43 Damien Alexander retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into his mouth.

22:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:46 Damien Alexander says, "Tardick lizards can get their own noodles."

22:46 Damien Alexander laughs.

22:46 You chuckle.

22:46 Damien Alexander takes a bite of a serving of hot beef-flavored ramen in a small bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.

22:47 Damien Alexander says, "Man, I'm hungry."

22:48 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

22:48 Johann says to Ather, "Half an ltc before we chart?"

22:50 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

22:50 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

22:50 The deck jumps underneath your feet as a torpedo explodes against the hull.

22:50 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

22:50 You hear a sudden high-pitched whine all over the ship as the engineer effects swift repair of all components.

22:50 You feel an odd shuddering, and a high-pitched hum suddenly begins to emanate from the reactionless drive.

22:52 Evenia Callseah grins at Nissi Valdaire.

22:52 Johann Schraft smiles.

22:52 You say to Nissi, "Any way I could get a key to the ship?"

22:52 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

22:53 Damien glances around somewhat nervously, then returns most of his attention to his meal.

22:53 Nissi Valdaire asks, "How the hell have you not had a key all this time?"

22:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "They're in the locker in the control room."

22:53 You say, "Oh, ok."

22:56 Johann says to Nissi, "Do you have a moment?"

22:56 The engineer's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Captain! The engine can't take any more of this!"

22:56 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

23:30 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah, thought so."

23:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "I forget exactly why. I think he went out yelling about wanting information so Qi Clan grabbed him cuz they had something to sell."

23:42 Eli, Fomoir of legend wanders in from below.

23:43 Eli, Fomoir of legend examines a shiny red deluxe ramen cooker with a golden dragon on top for a moment.

23:43 Eli, Fomoir of legend presses a button on the front of a shiny red deluxe ramen cooker with a golden dragon on top. The device grinds and gurgles for a moment, simultaneously emitting a burst of aromatic steam, and a serving of hot pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl drops into the dispensing area, which he promptly retrieves.

23:43 Evenia Callseah says to Eli, Fomoir of legend, "Did you have him feed them for me today? I hope so. Coz I don't wanna be you if you kill those fish."

23:43 Evenia Callseah grins at Eli, Fomoir of legend.

23:43 Eli, Fomoir of legend nods. "You asked me this earlier."

23:43 Evenia Callseah blinks at Eli, Fomoir of legend.

23:43 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Relax, they are well fed."

23:44 Eli, Fomoir of legend grins.

23:44 Evenia says to Eli, "I was apparently asleep, or mostly so. Ignore me."

23:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

23:44 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

23:44 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Now that I know that he quit because of their not being felo food, I've been making sure."

23:45 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "He's crafting now though."

23:45 Evenia Callseah nods.

23:45 Eli, Fomoir of legend quickly drains a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

23:45 Eli, Fomoir of legend gives a cup to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:45 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah that was mental. I forgot all about that small fact."

23:46 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "I could have sworn I saw him do it at least once after that, but it must have been my imagination."

23:46 Eli, Fomoir of legend retrieves about a dozen thin noodles from a serving of hot pork-flavored ramen in a small bowl and noisily sucks them into his mouth.

23:46 Evenia Callseah nods.

23:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Or maybe he tried and was like wait. I can't. Fuck."

23:47 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Poor dumb robot."

23:47 Evenia Callseah grins.

23:47 Evenia Callseah says, "And he got so confused when you tried to make him again. I felt bad for him for a moment."

23:47 Ather hmms.

23:48 Eli says to Ather, "Yeah, the robot will apparently not caretake to feed fish, if there's no felo food on board."

23:48 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "I guess it messes up it's routine."

23:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, no, who cares about that? I'm trying to think what to feed skipper."

23:48 Eli, Fomoir of legend laughs.

23:48 Ather Jammoa examines a robotic chef named Nellie for a moment.

23:48 Ather Jammoa says, "Ok, that thing's choices suck."

23:48 Evenia Callseah says, "He did have felo food aboard till he kicked it out of the hold. After that. Gadget told him to shove it."

23:49 Lily Kaise says, "'you can feed him rations."

23:49 Eli says to Evenia, "Did you already get rid of that dead aquapede?"

23:49 Evenia Callseah nods to Eli, Fomoir of legend.

23:49 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Maybe Skipper can eat that."

23:49 Ather Jammoa says, "I have no rations, alas."

23:49 Ather Jammoa says, "Or I would."

23:49 Evenia Callseah says, "I'd have offered him the fish otherwise."

23:49 Evenia Callseah opens a small black leather zip pouch.

23:49 Evenia Callseah removes a box of spacer rations from a small black leather zip pouch.

23:49 Evenia Callseah gives a box of spacer rations to Ather Jammoa.

23:49 Lily Kaise removes a Mutuality standard ration box from a large mesh gym bag.

23:50 Eli, Fomoir of legend says, "Poor skipper, he's gonna have to eat capsules."

23:50 Ather Jammoa says, "Ok, those might help some."

23:50 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

23:50 Ather Jammoa strides down.

23:50 Lily Kaise nods.

23:50 Lily Kaise says, "I fed asteria anything that wasn't in a package or can."

23:50 Lily Kaise says, "Or other continer."
