00:12:50 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:12:51 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

00:29:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

00:29:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:29:43 The computer reports that the four-person light carrier "Haydn Seek" has jumped out of the sector.

00:29:44 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Greetings."

00:29:50 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

00:29:50 
AEU destroyer "Firestorm" departed to AEU sector Providence Gate (Alpha-1) approximately 9 minutes ago.
EAOS transport "Registered Merchant 555" departed to Fringe sector The Fringe (Alpha-1) approximately 6 minutes ago.
League light cruiser "Haydn Seek" departed to League sector Earthgate (Alpha-1) less than a minute ago.

00:30:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:30:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:30:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:30:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:30:17 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

00:30:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:30:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:30:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:30:20 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:30:20 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:30:21 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

00:30:21 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

00:30:22 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

00:30:22 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:30:23 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

00:30:24 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

00:30:45 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:30:45 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

00:30:46  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:30:46 You are carrying a sheet of white paper in your right hand.

00:30:51 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:30:52 --

00:30:53 I really don't have time to respond in detail. However, in short, this is pure nonsense. The AEU government is blaming us for their own failure not to report to the initial QSA meeting and they should have felt the obligation to do so given our already diminished relations with the Mutuality. Second, the Council's primary concern was that the did not want the AEU to attack them and how would we assure that they wouldn't. They did not want anything else. So the underlying concern was that the AEU did behave in a threatening manner. It was clear that we couldn't guarantee anything to the Council since we were not the AEU Government and could not affirm anything but our willingness to convey to the AEU Government via proper channels that the AEU was to commit not to attack the Mutuality if not provoked. This is how and why the exchange went in circles because the Council kept stressing how would we be able to affirm that the AEU would not attack them. - Lily

00:40:41 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I swear, the target drones cheat in the sims."

00:40:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

00:40:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They don't even move."

00:40:58 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I can't recall if they shoot faster or not, to be honest."

00:41:02 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

00:41:04 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Oh."

00:41:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I can help you."

00:41:16 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Do they even.."

00:41:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They don't move at all."

00:41:27 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No, I don't think they do move, Keegers!"

00:42:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You usin the regular sim or the advanced, Aldis?"

00:42:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Tara is going to practice with me later, Shule. I was getting some practice on piloting and gunning at the same time."

00:45:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "And I feel like the sim drone knew where I was going. I constantly tried different and random movements, but it would always get a track on my location."

00:45:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, one thing to remember is that's it's always tracking your location if you're in range."

00:46:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I will see if I can focus on dodging."

00:46:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So it can see where you go. All it needs to do then is update which location it's locked onto."

00:46:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Poor Constantine. I had the fun times of showing him the sims."

00:46:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah that was great."

00:46:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You won't be able to avoid getting locked on to. The important part is to move fast enough after you are locked on to."

00:46:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

00:47:57 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Aenea here, a Fringe transport has jumped out."

00:48:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "That in itself is the issue, Shule. I can sometimes avoid being locked on, but then the sim ship moves rather slow...or maybe it's just me."

00:48:18 [General Communication] Prichard Grant transmits, "Hello Miss Melinda."

00:48:31 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Hello there."

00:48:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It does take a bit of practice, but you should be able to dance around the drone all day in the sim ship."

00:48:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll get faster."

00:49:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "I wonder...i'm going to try something..."

00:49:38 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Shall I call you Mister Prichard?"

00:49:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

00:51:19 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

00:51:46 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

00:51:56 [General Communication] Prichard Grant transmits, "It would, though I am just a humble civilian today."

00:52:09 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What about yesterday?"

00:52:13 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

04:39:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:39:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit

10:27:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

10:27:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

10:27:56 The ship is already moving.

10:27:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

10:27:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

10:27:58 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

10:27:59 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

10:28:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

10:28:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

10:28:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

10:28:05 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a pocket-sized purple holovid, a pair of gray canvas sneakers, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Space Market.

15:37:32 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

15:37:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

15:37:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident begins the launch sequence.

15:37:43 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:37:46 A launch trajectory is located.

15:37:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:37:47 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

15:37:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

15:37:56 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:37:57 You say to Lily, "Hi beautiful!"

15:37:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

15:38:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

15:38:01 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

15:38:04 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:38:28 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:38:28 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:38:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

15:38:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in New Earth, AEU gunship incoming."

15:38:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:38:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

15:38:46 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:38:48 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:39:06 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:39:08 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:39:12 You peer out...

15:39:12 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den" and the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

15:39:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

15:39:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

17:39:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

17:39:39 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

17:39:42 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:40:00 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:40:00 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:40:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:40:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:40:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:40:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

17:40:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:40:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

17:40:20 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:40:20 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

17:43:03 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

19:09:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

19:10:41 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

19:10:41 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

19:11:06 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

19:11:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident turns a high tech silver star print holovid on.

19:11:52 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A floating Space Shopping Network logo appears next to the words "LIMITED TIME OFFER."

19:12:00 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The man's hand traces lightly over the item, highlighting its features.

19:12:12 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera pans slowly over a modestly sized black and brown shamak hide. 

19:12:24 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The man says, "You know, it's not often we get in something like this."

19:12:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident flips a high tech silver star print holovid to PACC.

19:12:28 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A floating Public Access logo appears next to the words "Public Access HV."

19:12:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh they don't replay things... too bad."

19:14:06 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

19:15:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident flips a high tech silver star print holovid to WMOS.

19:15:03 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The view pans slowly through a lush forest.

19:15:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: An aged stump gradually comes into view as the camera pans.

19:15:15 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Once the stump is centered in view, the camera zooms in slowly.

19:15:22 From a high tech silver star print holovid: You see a sizable green growth on the stump. The camera continues zooming in.

19:15:31 From a high tech silver star print holovid: It becomes clear that the green growth on the stump is indeed moss.

19:15:39 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in to show the fine details of the mossy growth and soft rotting wood.

19:15:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

19:15:48 From a high tech silver star print holovid: After a long, lingering gaze at the moss, the camera zooms out and resumes panning around the forest.

19:15:58 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A deep voice intones gravely, "You are watching... The Moss Channel."

19:16:05 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a moment.

19:16:11 From a high tech silver star print holovid: An excited man suddenly speaks up. "Have you ever wanted the power of a computer in your very own home?"

19:16:22 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "You've been told it's impossible, but not anymore! Introducing the PERSONAL COMPUTER!"

19:16:29 From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image appears of a woman standing next to a computer about twelve feet wide.

19:16:38 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "International Computing Machines is proud to present a computer that fits into about HALF a room!"

19:16:47 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Visit a local branch of International Computing Machines and speak to a salesman today!"

19:16:56 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a moment.

19:17:01 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The view pans slowly through a lush forest.

19:17:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A patch of green on the ground gradually comes into view as the camera pans.

19:17:16 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Once the green patch is centered in view, the camera zooms in slowly.

19:17:23 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Some scattered fallen leaves lie upon the green patch. The camera continues zooming in.

19:17:32 From a high tech silver star print holovid: It becomes clear that the green patch on the ground is indeed moss.

19:18:13 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a moment.

19:18:18 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The view pans slowly through a lush forest.

19:18:24 From a high tech silver star print holovid: An aged stump gradually comes into view as the camera pans.

19:18:31 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Once the stump is centered in view, the camera zooms in slowly.

19:18:38 From a high tech silver star print holovid: You see a sizable green growth on the stump. The camera continues zooming in.

19:18:39 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Eli."

19:18:47 From a high tech silver star print holovid: It becomes clear that the green growth on the stump is indeed moss.

19:18:55 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in to show the fine details of the mossy growth and soft rotting wood.

19:19:04 From a high tech silver star print holovid: After a long, lingering gaze at the moss, the camera zooms out and resumes panning around the forest.

19:19:36 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The pilot stretches, smacks his lips, and opens his mouth to yawn. Then he pauses, and suddenly looks ecstatic as a lit light bulb appears over his head.

19:19:51 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The pilot deliberately lifts his wrist communicator to his mouth, pushes its send button, and yawns widely. Yellow morning breath washes over the device as various voices emerge from it, crying out in dismay.

19:20:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: An upbeat jingle begins, sung by a number of women: "When you're rising from your bed! Keep just one thing in your head:"

19:20:09 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

19:20:15 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Hey trouble."

19:20:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Howdy Mel."

19:20:18 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hello."

19:20:21 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "No one wants to hear that yawn! Get your finger off that comm!"

19:20:28 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A male voice adds in spoken word, "A message from the Association For Clean Airwaves."

19:20:37 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a moment.

19:20:43 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The view pans slowly through a lush forest.

19:20:48 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A patch of green on the ground gradually comes into view as the camera pans.

19:20:57 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Once the green patch is centered in view, the camera zooms in slowly.

19:21:05 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Some scattered fallen leaves lie upon the green patch. The camera continues zooming in.

19:21:21 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in to show the fine details of the carpet of moss.

19:21:30 From a high tech silver star print holovid: After a long, lingering gaze at the moss, the camera zooms out and resumes panning around the forest.

19:21:40 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A deep voice intones gravely, "You are watching... The Moss Channel."

19:21:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident flips a high tech silver star print holovid to ISNN.

19:21:42 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of a galaxy of stars swirling around rapidly. "Around the galaxy and into your home... it's the Space News Break on ISNN! Dateline: 14 August 2317."

19:21:59 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The scene cuts abruptly to show a well-groomed newscaster seated at a desk. He nods to the camera and arranges his papers before him.

19:22:12 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Our top story tonight: The AEU Outccord Negotiations."

19:22:17 From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image appears of the Accord logo with a big red X superimposed over it.

19:22:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

19:22:26 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "During the AEU election campaign, President Best spoke of having the AEU leave the Accord of Free Worlds, but most people dismissed his talk as hyperbole to win votes. Of course, in the beginning of July this year the President proved his detractors wrong and began the proceedings to allow the AEU to formally withdraw from the Accord."

19:22:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah we unfortunately did."

19:22:54 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newcaster turns to face another camera. "Each alliance within the Accord of Free Worlds enters into an agreement that they must abide by. This agreement is a monolithic document, but sets down regulations the member alliances must follow."

19:23:14 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image is replaced by a series of bullet points.

19:23:20 From a high tech silver star print holovid: * Monetary remuneration to assist Accord defense of interalliance space

19:23:27 From a high tech silver star print holovid: * Supply and resource shipments to the Accord for Accord use, stockpiling, and transfer to other alliances

19:23:36 From a high tech silver star print holovid: * Personnel, both military and civilian, sent to the Accord when needed

19:23:44 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The list vanishes to once again show the newscaster. "Of course, the agreement also sets down how a member alliance may leave. On 21st July, the Alliance of ExtraSolar Unions formally initiated the withdrawal process and sent Edward van Dannikin, leader of the controversial People's ExtraSolar Union party, to be their chief negotiator."

19:24:10 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "We managed to get a quote from Mister van Dannikin during a brief recess in the negotiations."

19:24:19 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of a middle-aged man with greying hair appears.  He smirks at the camera.  "Well, of course leaving the Accord is the best choice for the Union. All it's ever done is restrict what we can do. Once we're out we'll be a sovereign alliance again, free to make our own choices. Who wouldn't want that? Only people who don't want what's best for the Union."

19:24:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh that's the jerk."

19:24:52 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades, revealing the newscaster once again.

19:24:57 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Of course, not everyone is quite so positive.  Leader of the Opposition Ginevra Culwyn gave her thoughts to us a few hours ago."

19:25:10 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of a woman in her fifties appears. She frowns and looks at someone off-camera.  "This entire process has been chaotic, and there has been little in the way of debate or discussion. The President may claim he has a mandate, but even though his party won the election it doesn't give them the freedom to ignore disagreement."

19:25:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I agree with her on that one!"

19:25:38 From a high tech silver star print holovid: She shifts in her seat, looking a little uncomfortable. "This needed to be a careful, considered event. The only people who have had their say here are supporters of the President, basically yes-men.  Where is the referendum to see what the rest of the population want?  What about the people who voted for the National Patriots but don't want to leave the Accord?"

19:26:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Culwyn shakes her head.  "There is still no public plan, no discussion about what happens once we leave. Is it all in President Best's head, or is there really no plan set down?  This is an unparalleled act of self-harm, and the National Patriots are sleepwalking us into it."

19:26:32 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades, returning to the newscaster.

19:26:38 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Of course, there have been some significant events surrounding Outccord, such as the broadcasts from the now familiar Eli Grey."

19:26:49 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A picture appears behind the newscaster of an oddly blue-skinned man sitting in what is noted as the pilot lounge located on Old Earth.

19:27:02 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "As well as the strike by the Union's civilian pilots initiated by the intentional destruction of several transport ships."

19:27:12 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Footage of three transports exploding in New Earth orbit is shown, a fourth transport floating nearby.

19:27:21 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "By all accounts the withdrawal process is almost complete, though Accord experts suggest the AEU won't fully withdraw until the first week of September. After that... we shall have to see. Until then, this has been the Space News Break, only on ISNN."

19:27:43 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays as the camera slowly pans out from the newscaster.

19:27:50 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a moment.

19:27:56 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The holoimage shows a bright flame shoot straight upwards, gradually changing shape into a bird.

19:28:05 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Spinning, the fire bird creates the words AEU TODAY out of its own flame.

19:28:13 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The fire bird flies away, leaving the words superimposed over the newly revealed image of New Earth.  Blocky text appears underneath: JANUARY 6TH 2317

19:28:26 From a high tech silver star print holovid: New Earth's image is replaced with a view of two men, one sitting at a desk while the other relaxes on a couch.

19:28:38 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The tall, middle aged man at the desk nods towards the camera amiably.  "Good evening, I am Angus Ireman."

19:28:49 From a high tech silver star print holovid: He continues with a smile. "On this special edition of AEU Today we will be speaking publicly for the first time to a well known local boy - Ace Pilot of the Union's civilian corps Ather Jammoa - about the state of the Union, the status of the corps, and perhaps a few other things."

19:29:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Wow, there is never a day I can remember when not getting anything from my trustfund."

19:29:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident turns a high tech silver star print holovid off.

19:29:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I suppose taht is more important than why?"

19:30:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Getting your trust fund money Evangeline is more important than what we're standing up for."

19:30:07 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

19:31:07 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the south.

19:34:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heya folks."

19:34:33 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey Eli. How are you?"

19:35:07 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

19:36:34 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/General/SC.

19:36:34 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

19:36:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I could be better, but i'm otherwise alright."

19:37:24 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yeah I know the feeling. Sorry you aren't doing so good."

19:39:07 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

19:40:07 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

19:43:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Feh."

19:44:07 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

19:51:07 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

19:59:07 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

20:03:59 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I said, whatever we do, we stand for humanity."

20:05:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

20:11:07 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

20:19:07 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

20:22:07 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea castle.

20:23:07 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

20:27:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi all."

20:28:01 [General Communication] Sausage Lover Jada Nelson transmits, "Hi hi."

20:30:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Damn, I hate when Accord send me to the Belt of Orion."

20:30:08 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior pulsates gently.

20:30:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's one of my favorites."

20:30:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Battle of Mir is the one I hate."

20:30:29 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Only 3 reapers in here now."

20:30:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I hate that for an entirely different reason."

20:31:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just don't salvage with the rats. Find another sector and you're fine. I only fight rats fighters when I'm salvagin. Them rats'll whoop up on me. So I just go to a different sector."

20:31:18 [General Communication] Sausage Lover Jada Nelson transmits, "Aww."

20:31:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The reapers will I mean."

20:31:43 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I go to a different sector by default."

20:32:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't notice they're any more a problem there in Orion than elsewhere like the various beacons in the Tesla pipe they send me to."

20:35:28 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I know, I just don't like being able to see how much is in there from the outside for some reason, I prefer it when I jump in there rather than auto-vec in, I don't know why."

20:36:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't seem no different from some of the other beacons. I've found Rats in the sector them places too. I like Orion 'cause I'm so close to the station."

20:38:08 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

20:39:08 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

20:42:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "So, how are we doing today?"

20:42:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Watching the holovid right now."

20:42:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Doing alright I suppose."

20:43:08 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

20:45:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "And it's going reasonably well for me, all thing considered. It seems the Moss Channel is the only thing good on right now. After all, there's only so many times you can watch the reruns of the 2310 Competitive Tea Drinking finals."

20:48:49 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Medium Slicer". The organization has earned 2,435,042.88 credits.

20:50:08 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

20:55:08 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo suddenly jumps onto a dark purple leather captain's chair.

20:59:08 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps into Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap and settles in, purring.

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:59 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Carry on, Space Driver."

21:01:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Well, if you have time today, I would like to try my hands at some sim combat, Tara."

21:03:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sure, In a while, yeah?"

21:03:09 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo curls up and closes its eyes.

21:05:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Of course."

21:07:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Medium Slicer". The organization has earned 1,799,753.19 credits.

21:09:22 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Entertainment."

21:09:22 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a new notice.

21:10:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That doesn't even make any sense to me.."

21:10:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The heck are we comin to these days?"

21:12:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:15:09 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What do you mean?"

21:15:20 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "What I said."

21:15:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The latest headline. Beef fed cornstalks."

21:15:34 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I just found that headline confusing and dismissed it."

21:18:09 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Not a bad idea to ask about the confusing stuff."

21:18:45 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I understand whats going on, its more... why?"

21:19:00 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "For science!"

21:19:28 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Making our plants carnivorous?"

21:19:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe we can send 'em after the Outsiders."

21:19:49 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I doubt it was animal based beef."

21:20:07 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Meat is meat."

21:20:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not necessarily."

21:20:19 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "What about synthbeef?"

21:21:20 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I dunno. Hopefully its synthbeef and not the chocolate flavored kind."

21:21:46 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "And even if all meat was meat, I'm sure you'd complain if someone gave you the ass of the animal instead of a nice steak."

21:22:09 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

21:22:13 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rump roast is good."

21:22:25 [General Communication] Tara Flores cheers for Morris Corlew!

21:22:50 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Enjoy the hole in the center."

21:23:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Rectum meat. Uhm..."

21:23:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Meat popsicle."

21:23:36 [General Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

21:24:30 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "If your meat is that cold, you may need to see a doctor."

21:26:09 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior pulsates gently.

21:29:11 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Well, that was fun. What did I miss?"

21:29:20 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Everything."

21:29:21 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Check the new headline."

21:29:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nothing."

21:29:47 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You missed at least as much time as you weren't paying attention to."

21:30:27 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Any interest in a megapod?"

21:30:35 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "No, I just don't get a signal in-...I certainly hope that's synthbeef."

21:30:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes."

21:30:47 [Tactical Communication] Sausage Lover Jada Nelson transmits, "What is that."

21:30:51 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes here even too."

21:31:00 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Unless they've engineered carnivorous cornstalks."

21:31:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

21:31:21 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "If they have, I will never look at ears of corn again."

21:31:37 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Next headline we get is someone loses an arm to carniverous cornstalks."

21:32:53 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Freak Accident Involving Beef-Fed Cornstalk at Annual Hydroponics & Gengineering Fair Ends Juggler's Career."

21:32:58 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Calling it now."

21:33:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the south.

21:33:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

21:33:18 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

21:33:29 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe later then."

21:33:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:33:36 Prissy the sleeping big violet long-haired felo slides to the floor.

21:33:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

21:33:40 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:33:55 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:33:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

21:34:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

21:34:07 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:34:40 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:34:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

21:34:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:34:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:34:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:34:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:35:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:35:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:35:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:35:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:35:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:35:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:35:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:35:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:35:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:35:22 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:35:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

21:35:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:35:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:35:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:35:28 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:35:30 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:35:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

21:35:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

21:35:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:36:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:36:09 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:36:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:36:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:36:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:36:30 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:36:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

21:36:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:37:05 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I can do a megapod around 2100."

21:37:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

21:37:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

21:37:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

21:37:13 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:37:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sounds good."

21:37:25 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hopefully I'll still be awake."

21:37:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Heading to AFW command now, Aldis."

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:45:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

21:47:25 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo."

21:47:34 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

21:47:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yo. Ah! It's broken!"

21:47:51 [General Communication] Sausage Lover Jada Nelson transmits, "Uh oh."

21:48:09 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

21:48:47 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "What is broken?"

21:49:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My arm..."

21:49:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

21:49:56 [General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Uuuh...get to a medical center, stat. How could you not realize you broke your arm?!"

21:50:09 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

21:50:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I knew I broke it. I'm lyin in a creche right now..."

21:50:24 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What happened?"

21:50:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "BoltSong happened."

21:53:09 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the airlock.

21:53:09 I don't see "lily" here.

21:53:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
21:53:11 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr the humanoid service robot, Prissy the sleeping big violet long-haired felo, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.
You can go south and out.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

21:56:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:56:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:56:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:57:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:57:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:57:05 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Dure Moonbase to Dure Orbit flight control, an AEU transport is outbound."

21:57:08 The ship is already moving.

21:57:10 The ship is already moving.

21:57:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:57:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Dure Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:57:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Riverway."

21:57:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:57:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:57:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:57:19 A bright river of light dominates the view of space here: a tendril of dust lightyears long, illuminated from within by a handful of newborn stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:57:19 The computer reports that the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Zeta-0" has jumped into the sector.

Things are looking ok so far, just lots of rain. this is supposed to continue for several days though and I'm not one for putting much trust into forces of nature doing what you think they will
I hope everyone else who might be in the path of the storm here is doing alright

Having always lived in Australia, imagining these horrible storms is difficult.
May you and yours stay safe, and anyone else in the path of this.

22:43:01 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

22:43:03 [General Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

22:43:05 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

22:43:09 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

22:43:10 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hyperion flight control here, we record an outbound League scout."

22:43:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

22:43:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

22:43:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The corn fed beef stock is the cornivore. The beef fed cornstalk is a beefivore."

22:43:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

22:44:09 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

22:44:55 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Then you get to thinking about what beef fed beef stock would be."

22:45:00 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "So we have cownivors and cornivors."

22:45:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "A cannibal."

22:45:18 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Hoyt Moonbase, we record an outbound AEU scout."

22:45:20 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hoyt Orbit flight control, this is Hoyt Moonbase, we record an outbound AEU scout."

22:45:25 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

22:45:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "But people think badly of cannibalism, yet it's OK for beef fed corn stock but not beef fed beef stock if that's true."

22:45:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "As would a corn-fed cornstalk. Both cannibals."

22:45:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "'cause it ain't eatin its own kind."

22:46:01 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Seriously though, I would imagine if you killed a cow and buried it in a corn field, it would make great fertilizer."

22:46:07 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chortles. "You guys have clearly had a while to consider this carefully."

22:46:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not long."

22:46:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "But why should eating beef be wrong for beef but not corn?"

22:46:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Why should eating humans be wrong for humans, but felo takin a chomp outta us is all fine."

22:46:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I never said that was fine."

22:47:03 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident softly on the neck.

22:47:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm makin an analogy..."

22:47:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's just interesting, how we decide what's right or wrong."

22:47:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And we also laugh half the time when we walk aboard a ship and they attack us by jumping at our heads."

22:47:29 Lily gently rubs your back.

22:47:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We do. But we ain't happy when they attack each other."

22:47:43 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Only because we know we'll be healed in a few minutes."

22:48:03 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah, that's true too."

22:48:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They only bite us because they like the way we taste, so it's kinda our fault."

22:49:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But if they bite each other 'cause they like the way they taste, is that right or wrong?"

22:49:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If they bite each other, it could just mean they're getting ready for some light boning."

22:49:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "As long as them biting each other is a sign that they will be good bari fighters."

22:49:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Umm."

22:50:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I suppose that depends on perspective. To us it's wrong because we don't like seein' 'em hurt each other. But for all we know. It's like. Part of the felo hierarchy."

22:50:10 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

22:50:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

22:50:12 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Now, there's a thought."

22:50:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, she put a better way. I just meant that animals bite each other all the time for different reasons."

22:50:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Still, I don't like to see 'em hurt each other but don't mind if they hurt me."

22:50:50 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't mind eatin beef, but somehow cattle eatin each other seems wrong."

22:51:10 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

22:51:15 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's interesting how that kind of feeling comes about though."

22:51:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it does just have a certain inherent wrogness to it."

22:51:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And corn eatin beef...is just weird 'cause in general, with a few exceptions, plants ain't sposed to do nothin but sit there and absorb sunlight and nutrients."

22:51:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er,  wrongness."

22:51:43 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident softly on the neck.

22:51:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you softly on the neck.

22:52:05 You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

22:52:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And corn is a plant that does that sittin round absorbin really well...so the tought of it eatin beef...is just...the stuff of nightmares."

22:52:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thought I mean."

22:52:34 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "No it's not. Can you imagine steak flavored corn on the cob? That owuld be amazing. Especially wrapped in bacon."

22:52:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It would be a whole lot scarier if it started eating humans."

22:52:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I sometimes wonder something else too. If felo have come from the same nest, perhaps the first from that nest sorta have a protective nature. So maybe, they hurt a kitten if like...maybe they can sense it's sick, or something. So perhaps in a strange way, it's the felo protecting the herd."

22:53:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's a good thought, Johann."

22:53:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "New Earth that can eat people."

22:53:25 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Now what they really need is bacon fed corn."

22:53:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't much of a stretch to go from corn eatin a big ol cow to corn eatin a lil human."

22:53:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er a plant from new earth that can eat people."

22:53:44 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, that's true, I heard about that."

22:53:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ted you still up for that pod?"

22:54:05 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah."

22:54:15 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

22:54:28 Shule places several kisses on your neck.

22:54:35 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You got anyone else yet?"

22:54:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

22:54:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, what you got in 3 or under?"

22:54:48 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We need one more for a megapod."

22:55:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you softly on the neck.

22:55:07 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

22:55:18 You massage up and down Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

22:55:42 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Earth I guess?"

22:55:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah."

22:55:57 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hyperion flight control here, we record an outbound AEU shuttle."

22:56:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm far from awake enough for a pod, else I'd go."

22:56:08 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We are full."

22:56:58 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh good, I thought you were missing one. I don't feel so bad now."

22:57:16 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's hand.

22:59:10 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

23:00:12 I don't see that here.

23:00:17 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:00:25 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Endymion flight control here, we record an inbound AEU scout."

23:00:27 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Endymion here, an AEU scout has jumped in."

23:06:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

23:06:10 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
23:06:10 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

23:06:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

23:06:19 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:06:20 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

23:06:23 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:08:33 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

23:10:10 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

23:10:20 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

23:12:10 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

23:12:17 You glance at your communicator's screen.

23:12:17 There are three board posts.
There is one headline.

23:12:27 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

23:17:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gently massages your shoulders.

23:17:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

23:17:10 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

23:17:10 Shine the hungry big white glowing felo seems to be hungry.
Shine the hungry big white glowing felo enthusiastically gobbles up a small Bari-shaped tidbit.

23:17:12 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:17:15 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

23:17:28 Lily says to you, "Pet shine."

23:17:35 You stroke the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

23:17:35 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand.

23:17:43 You say, "I did."

23:17:43 You grin.

23:17:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You have to do that more often especially if she eats her treat."

23:17:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

23:18:03 You grin.

23:18:04 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth Orbit flight control, this is New Earth, AEU transport heading for space."

23:18:10 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:18:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Hey like good kitty!"

23:18:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

23:19:10 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

23:20:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So wow wonder that this late night phonecall bit is about."

23:20:55 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:21:09 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back and waist.

23:21:11 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

23:21:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "A Rogue journalist?"

23:21:20 You say, "Yeah."

23:21:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Are they referring to eli as a journalist?"

23:21:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

23:21:32 You say, "I doubt it."

23:21:37 You say, "I know where he is."

23:21:55 You say, "He's not hiding."

23:22:00 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hoyt Moonbase to Hoyt Orbit flight control, AEU transport heading for space."

23:22:15 Lily glances curiously at you and says: 'who or Eli?'

23:22:19 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Hoyt Moonbase here, an AEU transport has jumped out."

23:22:21 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:26:32 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Hoyt Moonbase, we detect an AEU transport inbound."

23:26:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

23:26:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident joins your group.

23:26:45 You smile.

23:26:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

23:26:47 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

23:26:47 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, a personal hoverpallet, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

23:26:49 You exit the ship.

23:26:49 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

23:26:54 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

23:26:54 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:26:57 You exit the ship.

23:26:57 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

23:26:58 You can't go that way.

23:26:59 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

23:26:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:27:01 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:27:01 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

23:27:02 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

23:27:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:27:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:27:04 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:27:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:27:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:27:16 The ship is already moving.

23:27:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:27:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Hoyt Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:27:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:27:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Riverway."

23:27:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:27:25 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Hoyt Moonbase here, AEU transport on an incoming trajectory.  Clear the pad."

23:27:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:27:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:27:28 A bright river of light dominates the view of space here: a tendril of dust lightyears long, illuminated from within by a handful of newborn stars.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
