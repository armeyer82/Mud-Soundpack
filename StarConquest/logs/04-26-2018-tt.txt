Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all
directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the
depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of

Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face
backwards.
Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other,
tortured bodies straining with the effort.
Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.
The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.
A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous
blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as
a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.
The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing
on the hull.
Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that
even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb
slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.
The tingling of your nerves subsides slightly into warm pressure.
Your nerves tingle pleasantly with every pulse of the colors surrounding the
ship.
A sudden blinding flash sets your nerves afire! Your pleasure nearly peaks!

carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around
them.
The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.
A small stream of rainwater catches the ant carrying the ship, and while it
holds on, it and the ship are quickly washed down the rivulet!

The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until,
after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean.
Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind
rises.

A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing
beneath the ocean waves.
The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
A pair of stars orbit together here around their combined center of mass. The

planetary system. Planets in binary systems are generally not large and are in
unstable orbits, but a few small rocky planets may exist.

much farther do you think?"

day ago."

too much of a strain on the battery. We do want to make it back home, too."

[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "So, let's assume we make contact. What's the objective
there? Play a round of Horrible People or two and go?"
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"That's good."
[PA] Jim Gruffudd: "We start simple, kid. The objective is to establish
communication without shooting at each other, exchange pleasantries, and see if
they're amenable to future contact. Then we go home with whatever we've found
out. We're just information-gathering."
A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to
a viewport.
[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "I'm pretty interested in how we're going to try and
establish communication! I mean, from a technical standpoint, I guess. Radio
signals? Complicated aerial starship figures? I have no idea."
[PA] Jim Gruffudd: "We'll try the hypercaster from the staging point, though
that's kind of a long shot. We'll try radio once we're in orbit."
[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "Neat, neat. What if they engage us? I mean, one of our ships
IS an Outsider hybrid. Should we just hold our fire and try to de-escalate
through overwhelming demonstrations of pacifism?"
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Do you advise people not be messing with the
hypercasters until we are ready?"
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "I can see someone doing it unless advised not to do so."
[PA] Jim Gruffudd: "Well, we can try to talk them down, but if they're firing
shots right away, our only reasonable course is to disengage and start back
home. We're not here to start a war."
[PA] Jim Gruffudd: "And, yeah, please don't hypercast anything out that way
until we're ready."
[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "Well, like I said, the stealth galleon might look like an
Outsider vessel at a first glance. Misunderstandings and everything!"
[PA] Jim Gruffudd: "The important thing here is to not move too fast. Don't get
greedy. Believe me, I know. I've set foot on dozens of unexplored planets. I
lost my best friend to a Spotted Froghawk. No one takes this more seriously than
me."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Wow. Sorry, man."
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Also, do not mess with the hypercasters while sitting at our point until we are
ready to begin communication attempts. We will be informed when that will begin.
To clarify, no dicking around with hypercasting."
Ryan Thomas suddenly awakens.
[PA] Wendy Arroyo: "I see. Sorry for your loss. What are the most important
things to do or keep in mind when landing on an unexplored planet? I think all
of us could use your expertise there."
[PA] Jim Gruffudd: "Yeah. If we ever find our way back to Jinu space... I'm
gonna find that Spotted Froghawk. And I will kill it."
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Aww man, sorry to hear that."
Ryan Thomas stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton
fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet
throw pillow on it.
Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "Hello."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Roast Spotted Froghawk."
The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm,
saying, "You forgot no pinging."
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Ryan, read Cartes general message from Goss. It'll get
you up to speed quick."
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Add that in too."
The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into
quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.
Ryan Thomas navigates his black touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and
peers at the screen.
Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding
you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through
billowing clouds.
[PA] Jim Gruffudd: "Yeah. Listen, it's been real."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "I don't doubt it."
Keegan Wantz switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Zéro Des Cartes/General.
The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm,
saying, "Aha. I will spacewalk to the Fwoof-Foom planet!"
Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Keegan Wantz strides south.
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"If anyone asks, this no hypercast information came from Jim upon my asking
about it. So, I am not just throwing stuff at y'all according to what I think
ought to be done."
The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "All
right."
Ali Candan switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.
The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm,
saying, "Jimm's the boss. It's sensible."
Constantine Stone walks in from the south.
Constantine Stone says, "Hey."
Constantine Stone sits down.
Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Poor Ian's going to be scanning for a
long time."
Ali Candan says to Constantine, "Check the boards for information if you
haven't."
Constantine Stone navigates his plain touch einrophone to a text-heavy
application and peers at the screen.
Constantine Stone switches a plain touch einrophone off.
Constantine Stone says, "Ah ha, interesting."
Constantine Stone says, "I will have comfortably settled into my weekend slumber
by then."
Constantine Stone chuckles.
The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

Subject: arrival time and pause

Melinda has informed us that we will be stopping approximately two light years
away from our destination and waiting until the majority of people are aware and
active. This is estimated to be midnight, give or take a couple hours either
way.
This is presumably a safety measure as well as so nobody jumps the gun. Unless a
rift storm pushes us toward our destination much faster than we anticipate that
means we will be waiting a signifigant portion of a day before we make first
contact.
If you have any questions please forward those to Melinda Michaels.
Thank you and have a nice day

The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering
blackness and finally just shifting mists.

one, finding a new updraft.

a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany
bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a
navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it,
a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a
bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a
large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies,
Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement
communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach
chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a sparkly ouija board, a medium-sized crystal

away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green

lizard named Asteria. Her face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"It's 18 light-years."
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"And nobody over there vacated the ship?"
The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,

but let me check to be sure."
The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Seems
we're all aboard."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb
slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.
The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift
comm, saying, "Two of the LTC, you said?"
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Sorry, that's 29 light-years. My bad."
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"It's been a long day."

Jim Gruffudd
He appears to be 54 years old. He is about six feet and two inches tall and has tan skin. His body is
thin with muscled hips and firm calves. He has broad shoulders and a wide chest. His face is round and
weathered, with a straight nose and round chin. His lips are thin and pale and occasionally part to
reveal a set of fairly white teeth. Beneath a set of wild eyebrows, his eyes are blue and round. His very
short, bristly hair is salt and pepper and unkempt. He also has a very short salt and pepper neatly
trimmed beard. He has square pale fingernails.
 He is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, and
a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. He is also wearing a rugged dark brown shoulder bag and a
black leather hip holster. His face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

[Starship "Zéro Des Cartes"; Airlock]
You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. A thick band that stretches across all of the walls
at a seven-foot height indicates that the ship is on red status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space. The hatch appears to be locked. A thin red band near the hatch marks that the
airlock currently possesses a safe environment.

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't
large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow
bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you
see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Thick bundles of wiring stream in from several locations
on the walls, carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A few cables rest on
the ground, haphazardly placed as if the focus was on utility over sparsity. There is only a small,
reinforced viewport visible on the airlock hatch, allowing you to view outside the ship. The room's focus
is the main display board: essential functions like shipwide power control and alert status are
controlled here. A few secondary boards have been haphazardly placed near the primary display, but they
seem to possess only the barest functionality. The room is surprisingly spacious, though the random
placement of equipment makes it difficult for anyone but the pilot to truly be comfortable here. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see a dark purple leather captain's chair, a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow

Important news has been received from home. It appears that President Best has granted amnesty to
notorious Rogue Navy. Message said that Kendra Janus is to be investigated to see if she is guilty of
wrong doing. A message is going out now from some of the AEU pilots to the AEU government, stating they
are renouncing citizenship. I am posting this here because messages are split between both ships QE
devices.
That is all for now.

We're at the staging point. Operations should begin between 2200 and midnight or so.
There is an Outsider blockade nearby, probably automated. Some probes already jumped us. Don't panic but
be on alert, ready to gun or scramble a fighter. We got a few minutes notice of incoming, so there's time
to react. Needless to say we'll probably have to address this thing tomorrow.

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't
large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow
bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you
see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan

Star Conquest Help: Losing Citizenship
--
Category: Background

There are two primary ways to 'lose' citizenship in an alliance.
RENOUNCING CITIZENSHIP
With a single specific exception, gaining citizenship with a new alliance requires the individual to
renounce their citizenship of their original (or current) alliance.  
In order to renounce citizenship it must be done in person, at an embassy of the alliance being
renounced.  This is usually done while in the process of gaining citizenship in another alliance, and
until the new citizenship process is completed the individual is considered 'stateless'.  Being
'stateless' is not the same thing as being considered 'unregistered', though it does limit an
individual's rights considerably.
The exception of course is the EAOS, where inductees (both permanent and temporary) gain automatic
dual-citizenship for the duration of their induction into the EAOS, unless the individual specifically
chooses to renounce their alliance of origin.  Temporary inductees become denaturalised EAOS citizens at
the end of their induction term.
NOTE: Renouncing citizenship of an alliance ONLY removes your legal protections and rights given to you
by that alliance.  The majority of the legal obligations an individual holds to their alliance of
citizenship remain for some time even after renouncing their citizenship, such as taxes, contracts, and
so on.
DENATURALISATION
As opposed to actively choosing to remove citizenship yourself, losing citizenship without your choice is
far more difficult.  
The most commonly known form is by 'going unreg' - specifically stealing alliance technology and
resources and heading into deep space, never to return.  This does not count as renouncing your
citizenship, instead this process forces the alliance in question to 'denaturalise' the individual who
'goes unreg' and force-remove their citizenship due to their breaking of a specific clause enshrined in
interalliance law: by 'going unreg' the individual has committed high treason in a fundamental,
irreversable way.
The Grand Amnesty removes the crime of treason and other negative aspects of 'going unreg' for anyone who
did so prior to 21st August 2304, but does not restore their citizenship.  Individuals who have 'gone
unreg' after 21st August 2304 are not covered by the Grand Amnesty unless this is specifically added in
an amendment to the Grand Amnesty by the alliance government of origin.  Otherwise the individual is
considered a traitor and guilty of high treason, etc.

Hello everyong, I know the staff has planned really hard for this event and I had every intention of
being there, but it seems that I have been signed up for a tux fitting for my brother's wedding so this
may not occur, if not I'll try and be available for everything else hopefully. It's a rather inconvinient
time for me, but it can't be helped, and believe me I tried.
until then I'm around until I'm not.

Well, we don't usually do this, but since we are, when things go beyond midnight, they get difficult for
me, as midnight game time is 1 AM where I live, so I suspect I'll be pulling an all nighter for this.

wave jim
You wave to Jim Gruffudd.
Jim Gruffudd puts a glossy black holodisc titled "Blockade Station Briefing" in a dark gray holo
projector.
-jim Evening sir.
You say to Jim, "Evening sir."
Ali Candan asks, "Melinda is also awake I think. Is she still in the other ship?"
FCI Scout Lily Kaise walks in from the south.
Jim Gruffudd says, "At least I didn't have to go hunting for one of these."

You grin.
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn smiles.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.
Morris Corlew shuffles in from the south.
Ali says to Jim, "Should we call for Melinda?"
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey Mel."
Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Paging Melinda to your
ship."
Melinda Michaels just entered the ship.
wave melinda
You wave to Melinda Michaels.
Melinda Michaels says, "I have returned."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles at Melinda Michaels.
Melinda Michaels waves.
Morris Corlew gives Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!
Jim Gruffudd says, "As I was saying... let's talk about this blockade station."
Melinda Michaels puts a heavy duty faux wood holo recorder in a black canvas gear bag.
Jim Gruffudd sets a dark gray holo projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color
show begins.
Melinda Michaels nods to Jim Gruffudd.
[From the projector] An image appears of an artificial object floating in space. It looks dark and glossy
and appears to be made of coiled tentacles in the manner of Outsider constructs, but it has clearly been
taken from a great distance, and the details are fuzzy. A quiet, cheery tune begins to play.
[From the projector] The voice of Jim Gruffudd speaks over the image, narrating laconically in a weary,
sardonic tone. "This is an Outsider blockade station."
[From the projector] "Let's get a better look." The station is outlined in three-dimensional wireframe,
then fills itself in with crisp, computer-generated detail.
[From the projector] A few points around the station start blinking. "The station has what Ian calls
'aggressive interdiction.' Not only will it stop us from leaving once we're near it, it'll pull us right
out of the rift if we try to get around it."
Hawthorn gives a low whistle.
Morris Corlew winces.
[From the projector] The shot zooms into what's represented as the top of the station, where a large
turret is mounted. "This is the station's main cannon. It's probably dangerous out to a good distance.
Don't get your mothership too close to it."
'yikes.
You say, "Yikes."
Melinda Michaels says, "Oh oh."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah ouch."
[From the projector] The image rotates to show a side view. A line-of-sight is drawn from the main
cannon, then interrupted by the sharp angle between the top and side of the station. "It has a weakness,
though. It can't fire down very well at things too close to the hull."
[From the projector] The view pans down, and a scattering of smaller turrets mounted on the hull are
highlighted. "But the Outsiders thought of that. They have point defense turrets all over the hull."
[From the projector] The view rotates to show the front of the station, then a zig-zagging path is drawn,
moving from turret to turret until it reaches the main cannon. "Still, though, something like this is
probably our best shot. Get in close with smaller ships, change direction a lot so the point defense
turrets have trouble tracking you, then take a shot at the main cannon."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Seems so much like a FAS not exactly obviously."
'wow.
You say, "Wow."
[From the projector] An animation of the main cannon exploding plays. "It might take a few passes."
[From the projector] The view zooms out, and a few small ships are highlighted, labeled as drone ships.
"Oh, and they'll probably have more of those drones around. Ian speculates they're fully autonomous
machines, and he says they're probably very intelligent, though I haven't seen any evidence of it."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "They probably stole the idea from the IFS...maybe."
[From the projector] The shot zooms back to the station, then the hull vanishes, showing the interior in
cutaway. "The station seems to be hollow, probably so it can be serviced, though we don't think anything
alive is in there right now."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.
nod
You nod.
[From the projector] A point at the destroyed main cannon blinks. "It looks like we'll have the easiest
time accessing it here, since we need the cannon destroyed anyway, unless we want to spend time cutting
through a reinforced docking bay door."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe the Outsiders and IFS are working together. Under the Chevaliers."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise blinks.
[From the projector] Another point blinks a distance away inside the station. "This seems to be the nerve
center. There's always a nerve center. Disable it and we should be able to get past this thing and do our
mission."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.
nod
You nod.
[From the projector] "It's probably full of robots and lasers and so on. We'll say six to eight
battlesuits should do the trick."
[From the projector] The voice of Georgie is heard faintly from offscreen. "Why don't the Outsiders man
these stations? Even just one to watch over the robots?"
[From the projector] There is a short pause, then Jim says, "No need for one of them to be out here by
itself. The Outsiders already know the truth... no matter who you're with, you're always alone."
[From the projector] The shot zooms back out, and the computer-generated graphics fade away, returning
the view to that of the fuzzy, real-life image of the blockade station. The cheery music fades. "Any
questions?"
Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.
The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.
Jim Gruffudd removes a glossy black holodisc titled "Blockade Station Briefing" from a dark gray holo
projector.
Jim Gruffudd asks, "Any questions?"
Melinda Michaels asks, "How close are we gonna need to get in order to launch the suits?"
Jim Gruffudd says, "Next to it, like usual."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Phew that is going to be hectic."
nod
You nod.
Ali says to Jim, "For shooting the cannon, is a corvette small enough? Or do we need fighters?"
"Disabling with fighters and destroying with suits." Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as
she ponders. "Will we need the fighter crew to stay up in the event drones are launched while the suit
crew is inside?"
Jim Gruffudd says, "The corvette should be small enough. And the fighters too, of course. They'll need
decent pilots."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Keegan Wantz nods.
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm a decent gunner, not a good pilot though."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Not for...something this technical at least."
Morris Corlew asks, "Are the suits goin in while the fighters are still up? Or will we be able to disable
it enough from the outside before sendin suits in?"
Jim Gruffudd says, "You might want someone paying attention in space, yeah. Ian thinks it's got onboard
manufacturing, but we don't know how fast they can replace lost drones."
Morris Corlew nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."
nod
You nod.
Jim Gruffudd says, "You'll want to blow up the main cannon first. In fact, you'll have to."
Morris Corlew nods.
'right
You say, "Right."
Wendy Arroyo asks, "Any way we can talk to the suits once they're inside?"
Morris Corlew asks, "Any idea if they autotarget like long-range lasers, or...will the fighter pilots get
lock notifications?"
Melinda says to Nissi, "You'll be staying with Yalobusha, correct?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."
Keegan Wantz says, "I can do a bastille, unless you want me in the Corvette."
Jim says to Wendy, "I don't think so, unless you've got a comms systems I don't know about."
-jim When are we planning to start the attack?
You say to Jim, "When are we planning to start the attack?"
Wendy Arroyo asks, "I take it we should take our highest tier suits?"
Jim says to Morris, "We haven't seen the point defense turrets in action, but it looks like they rely on
volume of fire more than anything."
Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.
Melinda Michaels says, "Ali and Gonzo Corvette. Keegan, Shule and Morris fighters. Nissi will need some
of us in the galleon."
Jim says to you, "The attack will start at 2200, or earlier if everybody is ready."
nod jim
You nod to Jim Gruffudd.
Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll do Galleon."
Melinda says to Hawthorn, "That was the plan."
Jim says to Wendy, "That would be a good idea, yeah."
Wendy Arroyo says, "I'm staying with the Buran, then."
Hawthorn says to Melinda, "Good!"
Keegan Wantz nods.
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn grins.
-melinda I won't be available right at 2200. I'm sorry.
You say to Melinda, "I won't be available right at 2200. I'm sorry."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Ill obviously be with the Galleon until we're ready for Ground."
Keegan Wantz says, "Do not autopilot straight at the cannon aye."
Keegan Wantz coughs.
Melinda Michaels nods to you.
Melinda Michaels says, "We'll adjust then."
Melinda Michaels asks, "Anyone else who won't be ready?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
Wendy Arroyo says, "I'm good for any time. Earlier the better."
Jim Gruffudd says, "Yeah, you'll want to move around a bit to keep those turrets from getting a bead on
you."
Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I'm likewise open for the rest of the evening and many hours after."
Keegan Wantz says, "Another hour and a half, might be able to be ready earlier."
Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Anyone alive over there?"
The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Several."
Jim Gruffudd gives a glossy black holodisc titled "Blockade Station Briefing" to Melinda Michaels.
The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I am dead sir,
how may I assist you?"
Melinda says to Jim, "Would you mind coming with me to the other ship so they can see this recording?"
Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."
Melinda Michaels says, "Never mind."
Melinda Michaels grins.
Gonzales Bourne asks, "Oh. Can I watch it there too?"
Jim Gruffudd nods.
Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Got a briefing on the
blockade station, Mel's coming over I think."
The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "They are all illusions, it's
a trick."
Melinda Michaels says, "I can just take it over and sort things out with that crew."
The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oy. Action time
already? Thanks Keegs."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "So where will the Ground crew be sorted Melinda?"
Jim Gruffudd says, "It won't be flying quite like you're used to. You'll need to be right up against the
hull to avoid the main cannon's fire, and moving around a lot to evade most of the point defense."
Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.
nod jim
You nod to Jim Gruffudd.
Keegan Wantz nods.
Morris Corlew asks, "Will our starmaps mark the locations of the main cannon...or better yet our
autopilots?"
Jim Gruffudd says, "Use your manual control keys to set a direction and just keep moving. Fire when
something's in range."
Melinda Michaels says, "I'll go do that then."
Keegan Wantz says, "More how I fly when I'm being cheeky and trying to solo things in a destroyer, I
think."
Keegan Wantz nods.
Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.
Melinda Michaels says, "I am gonna have them yell there questions over the link."
'makes sense.
You say, "Makes sense."
Jim Gruffudd says, "Starmap will work. The computer will keep you updated too."
Melinda Michaels holds Gonzales Bourne's hand, taking him into her group.
Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.
Melinda Michaels gives Jim Gruffudd a thumbs up!
Melinda Michaels's group strides out.
Wendy says to Nissi, "You want me gunning? Fixing the ship?"
Nissi says to Wendy, "Gunning!"
Wendy Arroyo nods.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "So guess i'm gunning and not on ground crew."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mm."
Morris Corlew says, "Don't think ground crew's been sorted yet? Unless I missed it."
'Not sure ground crew has been decided.
You say, "Not sure ground crew has been decided."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "We'll have to have that probably sorted before we do this yeah..."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "No but seems the ground crew should be in the other Galleon no?"
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Whichever, I'll just do what I can."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles.
smile lily
You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.
Morris glances questioningly at Jim. "Since we gotta disable the weaponry first, I imagine it may not
matter too much?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "Don't worry, I don't think I'll be doing much either. But I didn't come here to
fight Outsider robots."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Did we figure out how much range the thing has?"
Wendy Arroyo says, "A lot is what I hear."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "The mega cannon that is."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "So the galleon will have to stay out far away then. And skirt the edges of
the sector."
Jim says to Morris, "Unless we're being constantly assaulted by drones, there will be time to transfer
people over, I'd imagine."
Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.
Jim Gruffudd says, "And don't worry, I'm sure we'll figure out the range of the cannon."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Trial and error."
Morris Corlew nods.
Keegan Wantz says, "Hopefully it doesn't destroy one of the fighters outright."
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Morris Corlew winces. "Yeah."
Wendy says to Jim, "How about the homeworld? Sensors see anything about it this far out, maybe?"
'Yeah
You say, "Yeah."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that was my concern too A LRL is wicked enough but a long-range cannon."
Lily winces.
Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. That...might hurt a bit."
Jim says to Wendy, "A little bit. We'll worry about that after. Nothing too troubling so far, though."
Wendy Arroyo nods. "In time all things, I guess."
Wendy Arroyo says, "Are we sure we can destroy it with conventional weapons? We have considerably fewer
ships to ram into it this time around."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn blinks.
Keegan Wantz says, "Well, even with turtle tech."
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Just to clarify, we do
have some people with lower-level suits. Those people should not go into the station?"
Keegan Wantz says, "The guns are still vulnerable."
Wendy Arroyo says, "Yeah, but those are thralls, I think."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Jim Gruffudd leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Jim Gruffudd comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You don't have six high tier
battlesuits aboard?"
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We do."
Keegan Wantz says, "My brain might be failing me a little, but I think we also were able to disable the
Magistrate's weapons beforehand. That or the Mules hitting it just made it freak out."
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I was just getting
clarification so that crews can be sorted properly."
Keegan Wantz says, "And that's the biggest Outsider ship I've ever seen, so."
Keegan Wantz shrugs.
Keegan Wantz says, "Might have something else on the station."
Jim Gruffudd says, "We don't expect to destroy the station. But the main cannon looks vulnerable."
Morris Corlew nods.
The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We have 16 high tier suits
aboard."
Keegan Wantz nods.
Wendy Arroyo says, "Works for me."
Wendy Arroyo asks, "Are we going to take care of everything in one fell swoop, then? Disable the station
and move right onto contact?"
Jim Gruffudd says, "That's the plan."
Wendy Arroyo examines a small hot coffee dispenser for a moment.
Wendy Arroyo helps herself to a cup of hot black coffee.
Morris Corlew says, "Sounds good."
Wendy says to a cup of hot black coffee, "Black Giddy up."
Wendy Arroyo takes a sip of a cup of hot black coffee.
Wendy Arroyo glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.
Jim Gruffudd says, "Taking our time was never in the cards, I'm afraid. We'll need to make sure we can
make it back home, too."
Morris Corlew nods. "Charge and whatnot."
Keegan Wantz nods.
Keegan Wantz says, "We got out here with surprisingly, to me, little wear on the furnace."
Keegan Wantz says, "But I'm used to tactical platforms, I think."
Keegan Wantz coughs.
Wendy Arroyo says, "The furnace has almost two entire charges remaining, so that shouldn't be an issue."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "This thing has a much larger battery life, yeah."
Keegan Wantz says, "Not so much, the Siren's most of the extra battery."
Keegan Wantz says, "But being able to catch much more of the flow is nice."
Wendy says to Jim, "Oh, something came up while we were talking earlier."
Jim Gruffudd asks, "What's that?"
Wendy says to Jim, "Assuming we get talking and land, are we taking the galleon or a smaller ship? I
don't expect to find many roomy landing pads."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Plan for everything."
Jim Gruffudd says, "I don't think landing will be an issue."
Wendy Arroyo asks, "Reckon?"
Wendy Arroyo shrugs. "I mean, all the better, just double-checking."
Jim Gruffudd says, "We have a site picked out. We'll verify once we're in orbit."
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll be ready in an hour gonna start prepping."
Keegan Wantz says, "I suspect that if we do lan- oh, that works."
Morris Corlew says, "I just hope we're not only the second aliens these folks've ever met."
Keegan Wantz says, "Was thinking that they'll probably see us over the planet."
Keegan Wantz shrugs.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn nods.
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn stands up from a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a
dusky blue throw pillow on it.
FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I am ready."
Wendy says to Jim, "Do you have any general order tips for setting foot on new planets that you might
share? Anything, I guess."
Wendy Arroyo nods. "And yeah. Ready."
Jim Gruffudd says, "Be prepared for anything and don't get greedy."
Morris Corlew nods.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
Keegan Wantz nods.
Jim Gruffudd says, "Excuse me. I'll be back when we're ready to go."
Jim Gruffudd walks south.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise walks south.
Morris Corlew sits down on a soft dark purple leather couch with a lilac throw pillow and a dusky blue
