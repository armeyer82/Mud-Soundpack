Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

The vacuum of space seems oddly peaceful now that it surrounds you. It is not

glint all around you, stunningly bright and sharp with no atmosphere or
vacuum-protected glass to distort their light. A wide smear of stars fills one
area of the sky, pointing the way Coreward.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole
drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean
cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this
area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the
distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of
space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

I just saw a QI clan ship firing on one of our ships, which had launched to try
to leave the sector. The ship then kept still and has been destroyed. I was
going out to protect it but I was too late. This is the second time they have
shot first on one of our ships this afternoon, so we might need to think about
our tactics.

Tactics should be for people to be smart and get the hell out of the sector. I
landed when they fired at me to get a combat ship but they took off before I
could go engage.

We tried everything we could think of, but we couldn't find a way to rescue
Constantine from his rescue pod, so he will be going back to New Earth in it
once the interdiction is lifted.

Tobias and I cleared the sector so that Constantine's pod can get home. Just be
on the watch and try to be safe. Please for all that's sanity, do not sit still
in a sector with these guys.

It's unfortunate what happened here, but as Mel said I think the lesson is
clear.
Be on the lookout. Run up into the control room of the station and check things
out before you launch. And for the sake of sanity, don't sit still.

[Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at League Rapid Recharging Eatery &
Battery-Powered Rest Station; Docking Bay.

Hello all. Sad news to report. Nissi launched and got interdicted in her
siteseer and got blown up.
Just before she left I discussed making a brief side-trip to Feng Wo before
heading home, and she agreed to take us there. If one of the other charters is
amenable, I would still like to proceed as several people, myself included have
not been there yet, and we are rather close.
Please respond on the board or let me know before our departure on Saturday at
23:59.
thanks,
Johann Schraft

but otherwise I'm down to go home with you all tomorrow at 23:59.

correct me if I'mw rong, but are we not close enough that we could do it with a
simple heading? If so, perhaps a charter could simply get us the heading before
heading home. 
I believe i was told it was merely a day away from here, that could be made
easily with just one chart from this location I would think

New information has come to us from home. Nissi is back and capsuling out. She
hopes to make it before departure, but if she does not, we will delay departure
until she gets here. Please have your ships docked by our departure time because
we will leave as soon as she arives and I don't want to rangle people up from
all over the field.
Thanks,
Johann
