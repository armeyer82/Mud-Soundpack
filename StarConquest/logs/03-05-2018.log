-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:36 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.)

00:36 You remove a small suitcase from a leather briefcase.

00:36 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

00:36 I don't see "lily" here.

00:36 You open a small suitcase.

00:37 You remove a pair of white cotton briefs from a small suitcase.

00:37 You slide a pair of white cotton briefs on.

00:37 I see no "jeans form suit" here.

00:37 You remove a pair of blue corduroy jeans from a small suitcase.

00:37 You close a small suitcase.

00:37 You put a small suitcase in a leather briefcase.

00:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]

00:37 You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing white and violet aquatic life and coral rocks, a rainbow-colored portable hot tub with silver star accents, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, and Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo kitten here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

00:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]
You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

00:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

00:37 You can't go that way.

00:37 I can't find "sofa."

00:37 I don't understand that.

00:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

00:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi love."

00:38 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

00:38 You glance at your communicator's screen.

00:38 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! The Salvage Processor has been renewed and is in the Sector East of Steel Phoenix Command. The Battle Scanner is also renewed and is in the Sector West of Steel Phoenix Command. Organizations sponsoring These Temporary Space Stations are Space Invaders, Space Explorers Amidst the Stars and Starseekers. Please utilize them as this is a means by which you will pay less in taxes on all missions from Space Vermin Patrol involving salvaging or other salvaging and Recovery Missions obtained from Steel Phoenix Command. Beacon Drops adjacent to the Battle Scanner also pay more. Fly safely! And fight hard on the ground! [14:11  4 March 2318 GST]

00:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Love!"

00:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "What are you up to?"

00:38 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:38 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

00:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Making money!"

00:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise laughs.

00:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire laughs.

00:39 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

00:39 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:39 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "On Old Frontier."

00:39 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:39 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:39 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

00:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

00:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:40 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:40 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

00:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:40 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:40 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

00:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:40 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

00:40 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

00:40 AutoStar detects 15 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

00:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

00:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:40 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

00:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:40 You scramble to your feet.

00:40 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:40 You exit the ship.

00:41 Lily Kaise suddenly bashes her spacesuit helmet into your face.

00:41 You exclaim, "Ow!"

00:41 You laugh.

00:41 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

00:41 Lily Kaise removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side.

00:41 You laugh.

00:41 You grin.
Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:41 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:41 Lily Kaise says, "Haha forgot to take it off when I regbuilt the Salvage and BAS stations."

00:42 You grin.

00:42 You say, "It's ok."

00:42 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

00:42 I see no "kim" here.

00:42 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a broad, unforgiving expanse of jagged rock and regolith. Lights shining brightly from the nearby asteroid outpost are all that keep the surface from being in total darkness. The light forms shadows with sharp edges, highlighting every boulder and dangerous peak.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and out of the virtual environment.

04:16 --
Star Conquest Help: Asteroid Mining
--
Category: Activities
--
As one of the few people ever to visit those asteroid outposts scattered throughout deep space, starship pilots are able to assist with mining the asteroids that are hauled in.

Each asteroid is sectioned off into several sites. You have control of one site at a time. This site consists of buildings and automated drones. Your job is to choose which buildings and drones to build, and to continue mining at your site until all ore is retrieved. You may also 'research' new buildings by downloading data from the asteroid outpost, although this will cost you some of your usable metals. You are then compensated for your time depending on how efficiently you turned the site's ore deposits into usable raw metals.

That part sounds simple enough. You should also be aware that there are less scrupulous groups operating in and around asteroid outposts. These people, rather than mining at their own site, will occasionally send poacher drones to steal your own metals. Your drones will do their best to defend against this automatically, but you should ensure your site's security by placing defensive buildings to protect your own site's metal.

Note: It is not necessary to destroy buildings to reclaim their metals prior to ending your site. This is taken into account automatically.

How To Begin

Travel to any space station that accepts hauled asteroids. Find this location's asteroid mining operations room. Type START to begin.

Warning: Starting and cancelling mining sites in quick succession will give you lower and lower quality sites. For best results, complete the site you are given every time.

How To Control Your Site

You may continue to stand in the operations room and type commands to operate your site. You may also enter a virtual representation of your site using the ENTER command and walk around to observe what is happening. (Note: Players using screen readers will probably find the virtual representation option easier.)

List of Commands

START: Assigns a mining site to you and allows you to begin operations.

MAP: Look at an overview of your mining site.

STATUS: A general report of your site's resources.

SUMMARY: A more extensive summary of your progress.

METALS/ORE: Individually display amount of resource on your site.

DRONES: See what your drones are doing.

BUILDINGS: See what you've built and where your buildings are.

ENTER Enter a virtual representation of your mining site. It may also be followed by coordinates to enter at that location.

EXIT: Exit the virtual representation.

BUILD: Order the construction of a new building.

RESEARCH: Request data about new buildings from the outpost.

ORDER: Order new drones built, or existing drones upgraded.

DESTROY: Destroy an existing building and reclaim some of the metals used in its
04:16  construction.

TASKS: Decide which types of drones do which kinds of tasks.

END: End operations on your site and collect compensation (if your work so far deserves any).

CHANNEL or C [message]: Communicate with others running mining sites.

LICENSE: Upgrades your mining license at higher levels of industry points, gaining you access to higher quality, better paying asteroids.

UPGRADE: Improves specific aspects of your mining site. Any purchased upgrades will apply for all future sites.

DISPLAY: Toggles whether the semi-graphical map is displayed while building.

Special Asteroids

Most asteroids are classified as the "rocky" type. Once you have a mining license, you will occasionally be offered the opportunity to process more unusual asteroids.

* Metal-rich: These asteroids simply have more ore to process, and are a much bigger target for poachers.

* Comet: On comets, you may extract water ice for a boost to your payout. Ice is extracted using separate ice mining buildings, but the ice does not require processing.

* Radioactive: The third tier processors and higher will be able to extract radioactives as well as metal from your ore, boosting your payout. To support the power requirements of these advanced processors, radioisotope thermoelectric generators will be available.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

20:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Hey constantine, how are you?"

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm doing alright, how about you?"

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Not bad, just had a short nap...time to crack the whip again."

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"

20:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm doing a spot of mining myself."

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Reckon I'm going to find me some good astroids to salvage."

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Alistair, currently, the best place to mine is in the Frontier Cluster."

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "At some point I want to check out some good trading routes as well!"

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never tried trading. I think Ather knows a fair bit about it."

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks lilly, I'll check it out, is that where there are usually bari?"

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though, our poor relations with the League and Mutuality will limit our route options, I think."

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes Ather is our Trading pro."

20:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "It just doesn't seem the time for it! Especially with the outsiders surrounding us...polotics annoy me!"

20:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."

20:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It's going to be a bit difficult to get a lot of trading done though because we can't trade with Mutuality or more than likely with League since we have no diplomatic relations with either of those alliances."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I sometimes wish that those in power would strong arm the diplomacy a little, but then I can sometr salvage it is then, we can't be out of the loop forever. It'll hopefully turn around."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Sorry mis comm."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I meantr we will get there eventually, well hopefully."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure what can be done presently. The mutuality just straight up doesn't like us. I don't really see them considering any offer we can realistically make them."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You certainly can salvage, asteroid haul or do beacon drops as we have stations of our own. Just look at the messages on your communicator from time to time because I have been building those stations for us to use in our sectors."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I think the league won't make amends with us until the mutuality okays it."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is so hilarious and so, so League."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah but are we forgetting the history with the outsiders?"

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Damn it."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think unfortunately some have forgotten."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Best for one."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Even though it wasn't that long ago."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I don't know what's up with his memory."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It has nothing to do with Outsiders but with the AEU current government and past transgressions on the part of AEU pilots themselves."

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Can we be completely sure of no influence though?"

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Influence of what?"

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No but our lack of relations isn't related to that aspect."

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it ties into it somewhat. Part of the reason we left the Accord is that our government no longer believes the Outsiders are enough of a threat to contribute resources to defend against."

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the league can say what it wants, but they dissolved the nonaggression pact after we left the Accord."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Didn't the mutuality send some kind of diplomatic ambassador recently? I thought there was a message on the boards about it, in the conference room?"

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We sent envoys to them."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The negotiations broke down quickly."

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was voice at the time and kept a bunch of records about it, if you're ever interested in reading them."

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're not really that great, but it does provide an insight into what the mutuality thinks of us."

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not much, that is."

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah I would really like a copy of those."

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I mean a copy."

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, next time I'm on New Earth I'll get you one."

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah that would be appreciated."

20:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Do you think my latest run in with pirates might be related to the situation? I mean will it mean more pirate activity?"

20:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unregs dislike the union in particular for many reasons, but pirates sort of prey on everybody."

20:17 [Tactical Communication] Breton Ormarr transmits, "D-04 rats in coming i'm dealing with them."

20:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think it was probably unrelated."

20:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The league and the merry band don't fight one another now, though."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the merry band may be strengthened by that in general over time."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Hmmmm...sounds like I need to polish my waning combat skills."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good idea!"

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you've never flown a beacon by yourself, I recommend checking out the simulators at Accord command."

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't go today, but if you want someone to show you, I can show you tomorrow. Also Shule and Ather are both much better teachers of combat piloting than me."

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So if you can get one of them, all the better."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But no harm in trying the simulator yourself, there's nothing to lose but a little time."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah I will do, I'm just about surviving miners and fighters at the moment, but anything more tough and I'd be space debris."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks for the suggestion."

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Pirate activity is an ongoing thing Alistair. I have experieenced encounters with Pirates and Ifs since I became a pilot over 4 years ago."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "When we can, we actually do engage them but there haven't been many of us at work lately. It's great fun!"

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Yeah I'd like to kick their ass!"

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I normally just avoid them now, but for a while I tried to disrupt them whenever I saw them."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You have to imagine every chunk we let them salvage will somehow lead to them invading us later."

20:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Through using the resources or selling them, or whatever."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The transports look harmless but they're constantly waging a war against us."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well hopefully we can all get together on some of that activity. As I say, we're just at work infrequently tehse days."

20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "These days."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Should I drop my salvage at steeSteel Pheonix?l."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Steel Pheonix?"

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes please."

20:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "No problem, the extra creds definetly supports my fun."

20:40 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

20:43 [Tactical Communication] Breton Ormarr transmits, "Anyone going to run beacons before end of conquest?"

20:43 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Most likely, no guarantees though."

20:44 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "I did all mine. Nests though on the other hand."

20:44 [Tactical Communication] Breton Ormarr transmits, "Yeah I could do with nests to, but no mule."

20:47 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Long Haul". The organization has earned 214,513.67 credits.

20:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks for the tip lilly, good payout."

21:02 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Long Haul". The organization has earned 423,445.53 credits.

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nice load there."

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Damn, yeah thanks."

21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good evening."

21:18 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

21:18 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.
