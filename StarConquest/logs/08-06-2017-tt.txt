Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

sal
You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball
of frozen water.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a
single spacesuit glove.

Scan which debris?
A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris
is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:
Debris
------
Mass: Very Small
Coordinates: (5, 2, 4)
Distance: 10
------
sal
You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a
single spacesuit glove.

Scan which debris?

A few green lights blink on, then off again a moment later, as a piece of debris
is scanned.  The computer then displays the following:
Debris
------
Mass: Small
Coordinates: (4, 8, 2)
Distance: 3
------
sal
You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an old
engine casing.
