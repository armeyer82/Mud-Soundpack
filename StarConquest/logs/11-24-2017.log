-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Future Crimes"; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Meow the little calico CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, a small purple trash bin, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.

20:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:31 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: u2>[|Kv#+S?*2.Oe/Z7BIZzKWk6sp=+*.n%VH0~_

20:32 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.

20:33 You are carrying a pair of navy blue leather boat shoes in your right hand.

20:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Celestial Explorer. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:33 You put a pair of navy blue leather boat shoes in a leather briefcase.

20:33 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

20:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:33 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:40 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 515" has jumped out of the sector.

20:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:40 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

20:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Celestial Explorer. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:40 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:01 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
