05:13 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

05:13 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Some day, I shall get promoted beyond this heavy transport."

23:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How many promotions is that?"

23:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Uh."

23:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I have received my second non-promotion towards the heavy finally."

23:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "7? Maybe 8?"

23:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just got the medium."

23:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If you want one of invaders glorious max velocity increase and storage increase plants for a bit more storage and slightly faster engine, the cost is only 150 million EAOS credits! It is grand investment which will surely pay for itself."

23:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It'll be on my list of things to get, in the future."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, you have a very very very long way to go. I don't recommend people use such a plant without a medium transport or better ship for couriering."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause you're going to have that ship for a while, see."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you can put plants on courier ships?"

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yep."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess how would they stop you."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a plant."

23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why do you think I just said what I just said about the plant I advertised?"

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assumed you were talking about for ships in general."

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "A beacon amp helps too, for those Tandem deliveries."

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "...no, man. A storage increase and max velocity increase plant is worthless on any other ship."

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. that's what I thought, too..."

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I was thinking."

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The fuck you two are smoking?"

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was like huh, I'm obviously never buying that plant."

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, I thought you being sarcastic about it paying for itself."

23:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You are all beyond hopeless."

23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I don't know? What some?"

23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Best solution for curing hopelessness: lay off the haze until you can handle its effects."

23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I made that plant just for me and my couriering, but I suppose I wouldn't mind selling other cuttings. It's honestly served me very well."

23:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No doubt."

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Was frontier cluster ever cleared?"

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't think so."

23:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily usually sends out a notice."

23:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can always try landing on it."
