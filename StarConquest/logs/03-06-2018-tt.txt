-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It's
actually going quite well."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It's
still a bit early, but I'll give a more concrete report when I'm done with it."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "So far,
they've stolen 107 metals from me, which is more than I'm use to. Usually I
don't get more than 100 metals stolen from me for an entire site. However, I've
collected 304 of their metals."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "We'll
have to see how the ratio is at the end of the site."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Yes, but
I want it to be a sweeping win, not just a win! Go big or go home, and all."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "If I can
keep the number from getting to 200 metals, it'll be a win."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Cause
I'm hoping for 1000 plus poacher metals."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And I've
not had any overlapping waves of attacks, by the way. Usually they're destroyed
in 5-10 minutes tops."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I hope
so!"
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I'm
reasonably confident in my formation of defense turrets."

attack."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Time
marked. That took 7 minutes."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Got over
100 metals and lost uh, 19."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I've

Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Harder
to do on metal-rich asteroids, but not so hard to do on rocky asteroids, comets
or radio active ones."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Well,
honestly, placement is everything."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Why
aren't you maxing out your defense turrets and putting up that last chaingun and
sharpshooter?"
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "You can
have a total of 10 defense implacements."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And
20000 metal sites are definitely worth maxing out your defense turrets for, in
my opinion. Maybe not 36 drones, but definitely 10 defense implacements."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "What
level of mining upgrades are you at?"
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And
belatedly Cheri: mining does require you to think, especially during the initial
setup process. You have to be adaptible based on the sites you get, even
occasionally changing the order of researching around. So I agree with you in
that it can definitely be interesting! After that setup process though, you can
pretty much just vege out and let your drones do the work while you read a book
or something."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And yes,
36 drones is when you max out all routing arrays, relays and towers."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Licenses
aside Kert, what level of mining upgrades are you on? Metals, building
reclamation, drone reclamation, research etc."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I
sometimes fucking hate the default panel placement. I wish they would just keep
them as outlyers."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Like 3,
3? Why there, whyyyyy!?"
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "That
shit happened to me just this afternoon."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "That's
not too bad. You're cruising right along."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Yep."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It only
gets mega annoying when it's right in the way of where you want to put your
first drill site or processor."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Then you
have to build a second panel in the right spot, then destroy the interloper,
then you can start to build out your site."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I'm not
going to lie to you, at 20000 metals I was already starting to build 36 drones.
People use to think I was crazy, but well, there we were."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I was
getting 95-96% conversions, and they were still in the eighties."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "So who's
the crazy one!?"
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I
wouldn't do all that."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But I do
only have one processor built; an enhanced ore processor."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But, I
have 4 drills and 2 borers."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Kert, if
you're going to stay on the lower end of the number of drones built, you're
going to need to halt operations at every attack so your drones can defend
instead."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Between
43-44000, and a bit under 5 hours."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And yes,
I know it can be finished in less time if I built more processors."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But I'm
usually doing stuff while the site is running."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It was
about 53000 today actually."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Yeah,
replicator doesn't count, because your drones aren't always operating it."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I've
used guard drones before."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "They're
more trouble than they're worth. You end up spending the metals to research all
the way up to them, then build the building, then waste the time and the
additional metals to upgrade your drones to guard drones, which can't carry as
many metals as basic drones."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And in
my opinion, they're still not able to defend the site on their own without
defensive implacements."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "People
will usually just tell you "don't do this it's a bad idea." I on the other hand,
tell you -why- iI- think it's a bad idea."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But yes,
there are some drastically different methods of setting up mining sites. Liam
use to set his up in a unique way which got him done with it in around 3 or so
hours, but he ended up losing a lot of his conversion because of the way he does
it. Johann seems to do a similar style to Liam's."
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Megapod?"
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Granted,
with so many metals on asteroids at highe rmining levels, you lose less and less
of that conversion."
[Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Shallow, perhaps?"
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Depends
on the group, I have no problem."
[Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I haven't done my deep yet,
but I don't need deeps so."
[Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "I did my deep. I'lll help
out any team that needs help out."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Wow,
people already did deep assaults in the last two or so hours?"
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone
else?"
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Oh woo,
only lost 15 metals in that last attack, and up to 600 metals from poacher
wrecks. This is really really good so far."
[Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Kinda need one more, would be
helpful."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Well, I
have a lot of things maxed out. 36 drones, 10 defense implacements."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And
strategic placement of my defense turrets."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I
actually have one chaingun and one sharpshooter within two units of my
coordinator from two different directions."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Then I
set up an outward perimeter of chainguns and sharpshooters, putting chainguns in
areas that might overlap slightly with the sharpshooters so that there can be
more concentrated fire power."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Then I
have some outlyer sharpshooters and chainguns."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Those
are like, the scout turrets that pick things off from farther away as they're
approaching the coordinator."
Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "My
snipers, if you will."
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "If not
megapod maybe a nest or something."
[Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Have myself, and one other
that haven't done our pods yet."
[Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Nest nest whee."

think bryan wanted?"
[Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Bryan and jada both want
shallows."
[Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Michael and I have bari suits
already so not doing deeps won't hurt much."

[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "We can do
that."

[Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Yeah, gotta sort suits."
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Who has
what."
[Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "For me eaos, league, bari or
rental, all tier 2."
[Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "I have eaos 3."
[Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "For 3s, I have league,
bari, muti, AEU, and eaos."
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Get that
bryan."
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "League,
michael."
[Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "So, I can damage with my eaos,
support with my rental or repair with my bari."
[Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Support."
[Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Think jada has league,
rental, and muti in 3s."

a Tardick lizard named Asteria
This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back
pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the
time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat
awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and
spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its
back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of
curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a
slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

we don't lose access to ship components we own."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh yeah it's the league
suit I just sold both of mine. I probably could have just kept them but I wanted
to free up the slots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I scratch my
head sometimes as some of the tech we have access to. Like the EAOS fiber optic
and fringe massively parallel arrays."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah I sold mine too,
no sense in keeping that slot where now I can get other suits for that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why would you
want the ability to track multiple targets? I've never seen anyone do it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like it
would just confuse your gunners."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It would confuse the,
you know what... out of me."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We don't have the same
capabilities exactly but one can do quite a bit with the Thrall suit and the aEU
can use light abilities like I did on our last cleanup of Old Frontier. I got
into a little bit of trouble with being targeted at times but I managed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The thrall suit
seems like it would be great for GMG and tesla."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It is awesome for
tesla. I use it all the time now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, then we went on
to ship components and what the effects are, because I think the largest storage
extender we have, is that League, the merchant? Do we still have that?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh crap, I
forgot about the storage extender."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That really
sucks."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The issue is at Tier 3,
there are no repair capabilities so it's more of an attacker at that level."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No you can still get
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think
the merchant-rade compression is league."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, what Lily
said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Merchant-grade."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, but for the
tier 2 and 3 level you do still have the rental which is pretty ok for solo
tesla I think."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't think that is
league only it's still on Drydock and I have obtained it since our breakup."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh yeah, I think that
is old coalition tech or something?"
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah it is Merchant's
which I don't believe belongs to league at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think we should
really come together to petition our government to either help us fix our
relations with the League, or help us out with some of these components, like
scoops and a better tracking array."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So we lost the league
battlesuit and the Luna tracker but one can get by with the Fringe Tracker. Just
don't track two targets at a time unless you're comfortable with doing so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The latter might
be possible. I don't think the league is going to budge. I've even heard that
they won't repair relations with us until the Mutuality signs off on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "About the coalition
tech, I have seen things in that same store that say something about coalition,
does of course not mean all of that is old coalition, but it could be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I really can't get
what we have done to deserve this treatement from them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Left the accord,
said bad things about unregs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nevermind that
leaving the accord doesn't mean we abandoned the defense of humanity."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well Our government
needs to assure Mutuality that they're not going to attack them. That was their
concern when we met with them and since we could not provide enough assurance
nor provide them with enough concrete/verifiable evidence that we could effect
this with the AEU government, this is how we've lost access to the Skim.
However, of course now they won't sell anything else to us."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That the fringe
used weapons on its own civilians and the league still wanted an alliance with
them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That the fringe
used weapons on its own civilians and the league still wanted an alliance with
them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops, sorry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "League people surely
have said bad things about unregs, not to mention the stinker particularly
Morris made, on general, about the mutuality signing the non agression pact with
Kelsy's lot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, was he not
in favor of that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And we never wanted
to leave the accord. I never in my life said I wanted to leave the accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we did
what we could. I think the problem is the occupation has become too distant a
memory for the people in power."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh my goodness, he
annoyed Aisling senselessly about it, where I just told her I didn't really like
it, but I did understand her personal reasoning of wanting to protect her
family."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't mean
we're finished, if we remain strong enough and willing enough to fight them
together if they return."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Her family? Does
she have family in the merry band?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, oops."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No. But with a non
agression pact I think she believes or hopes the pirates won't attack unregs,
like her family?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was confused."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I thought
we were talking about the similar pact the league just signed with Kelsey."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That really
chaps my hide -- the merry band invades and attacks our space more than the
outsiders do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or maybe it even was
the agreement or something, I don't know. That was what she told me anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they want to
defend mutuality space, that's fine, but they also attack alliance space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can guarantee
Ather will never support repairing relations with the League while they have
such an agreement with Kelsey."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We also once had an
inofficial spoken agreement where Kelsey said he was not going to attack us
while so many of our pilots were out of comms on expeditions. A certain fringe
pilot who ended in prison for felo abuse broke that and it ended in a cluster
mess."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Anyway, I need to go
do some stuff, later."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Later."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Take care Kim."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I think that still
stands. The attacks have been from Clan Patrols lately."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think she
might have meant him attacking home space while we're away."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't realize
that was a huge problem, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like what
happens when there's a sector siege when no one is awake?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Doesn't the navy
just get it?"
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That was temporary
though as it seems we may ourselves have broken that agreement but some of that
is pretty vague now. I just can never support the approval of pirates in our
space at any level. Yeah too, I know that Ather will more than likely never be
willing to negotiate with the League since they are in bed with the Merry Band
now."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh well the League
wanted Fringe Tech that's why. They sold out to the Mutuality in spite of the
Merry Band so there you go."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
Lily Kaise kisses you.
Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped
headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere
blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! The Xenology station East of
Steel phoenix Command will expire in a couple of days. Since the Xenology
Scanner we're utilizing is rather pricey, and it has received only one use,
although very generous, I am hesitant to redeploy a new Xenology station until
we can verify that AEU pilots will utilize it. We will certainly put up future
Xenology stations if AEU pilots participate in artifact hunting. The other
Station which needs more activity is the Salvage processor East of Steel Phoenix
Command. Please use it or lose it. AEU organizations will support at least the
Asteroid, BAS and Salvage processing stations but if these stations are not
utilized, then the resources expended are questionable. We certainly want to
continue to promote income for all AEU pilots through less withdrawn from your
proceeds which these temporary space stations provide. If anyone needs
directions on how to access these stations, please ask. Fly safely! And fight
hard on the ground! [18:45  6 March 2318 GST]

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with

and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
