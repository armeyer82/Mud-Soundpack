-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

02:24 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, a glossy red ceramic felo chow bowl, and an early warning space defense device here.
You can go enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
You float close to the luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer", open the hatch, and carefully float inside, orienting yourself so that your feet hit the floor as you enter the ship's artificial gravity field.

02:24 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:24 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

02:24 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

02:24 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

02:24 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

02:24 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

02:24 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]

02:24 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, and a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons here.
You can go south and out.

04:10 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

04:10 The computer announces, "Setting course to Artifact Beacon Alpha 275."

04:10 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

04:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

04:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:10 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

04:10 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

17:59 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons, a cup of hot French vanilla coffee, and a cup of hot French vanilla coffee here.
You can go south and out.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

18:53 [Starship "Celestial Explorer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers", a wormhole drive tracer, a glossy silvery gray ceramic felo chow bowl, a silky cerulean cushion decorated with embroidered dark red dragons, a cup of hot French vanilla coffee, and a cup of hot French vanilla coffee here.
You can go south and out.
