Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

you just view the cartridges in projectors?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Morning
folks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Time for the
extermination of more RATS!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey
Eli."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey

curious what the officer said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Come out
to the landing pad."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh great. This sounds
like it will be lovely, maybe I shouldn't have asked right after getting up."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi there."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Howdy."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hi Mel, me and those
damn buttons. Especially when I've only had my eyes open for like two minutes."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Buttons get in the way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits an irritating burst
of static.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Can you shoot at
the nests from space, or will the ship land in it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ships
land on them. You want a crew of 4 to do those though, and they're done in
battlesuits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Well that does
remind me I need to do more ground combat to earn upgrades for my battlesuit."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yeah, cool. All right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least
not until we know more. If we want to waste resources there are other ways."

stands."

been wasting some here and there."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not that
I'm necessarily advocating that, that was just the thrust of Lily's post I
think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident

it sucks."

nutty."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I might salvage
after the suit grind is done."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Gotta get to the
next upgrade level."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You
could do a load of salvage, then expel it all in the upper atmo of a gas giant."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
"Well I can understand why new pilots need to work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That way
it's sort of like combo salvaging and scooping."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know.
And now even when the strike ends, I still can't scoop."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Since I
blew up my transport and we can't buy scoops anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "What? We can't buy scoops? Really?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Why did we strike?
Where is that information?"

can't buy stuff from Mutuality space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not ship
related stuff, anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I thought we could if we were taken over there?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Good
question, Kaiulani. Maybe we should make a board post about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
short version is that our president wants to pull out of the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "... Goddess above. Somewhere else better sell scoops then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I am trying to
come up with a profile to graduate from cadetness, if that's how it's done."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And a
lot of us believe this will spell doom not just for the Union, but for humanity
as a whole."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yeah, and we don't want him to. Or rather, we don't want to."
[General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau
Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Aside
from that, he kind of rules with a tight fist in general. He wants to kick
foreigners out of Union space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Rediculous."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He also
doesn't believe that the Outsiders are a credible threat anymore, which is
obviously a bit sticking point for a lot of pilots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Best must be
stopped all together before he takes over completely and we never get our Union
back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, in
general, we believe the direction he's taking us in is dangerous."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A blockade of New
Earth?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think
he really believes that either, about the Outsiders. I think tha'ts just
propaganda to make unregs look even worse."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So we
have been preventing trade ships from reaching Union planets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It had
some small effect reported in the news several weeks ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He also wants
to privatise the corps, probably so he can sell it to a relative just like did
with those military contracts, though that was never proven."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel
like if privatizing is on the table we should be able to buy it ourselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We're
all billionaires, after all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of
course Best would never allow that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, or sell
it to REvo or Hyperion Security."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Stay safe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Launcher and
Beacons are just out side, Eli, in the Requisitions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually
Jonothon, could you give me a ride back to new Earth when you go."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I can. Where are
you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm on Accord
command."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
anything with an electromagnetic matter manipulator."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm. That's what
I thought. What about the RATS attenna?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Antennas
and such you get just from blowing up RATs. Your ship will automatically pull
them in."

smell like a girl if you are wearing some girly perfume or used some flowery
soap."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You do realize this
is your fault, since you started sniffing everything? People used to pay less
than no attention to what people smelled like."

a bee had a baby."

piece of debris in a full field of debris.."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The debris scanner."
[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That only scans debris
chunks. I am looking for a ver specific item, amoung loose debris."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What exactly are ya lookin
for?"
[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A RATS probe that has
dropped off sensors, no power readings."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. I think the anomaly
detectors at SVP will help with that. And I'm thinkin they show up as "other
object" not as debris. But it's been awhile."
[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is that?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "SVP? Same place you got that
mission. Space Vermin Patrol Command."
[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm. I'll have to check
that out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Alright, the
tech says that they're pretty much just regular electronic binoculars. He said
they were pretty standard gear for patrolling a planet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well,
that doesn't really give us much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They can
identify certai meterials, but mostly they're just binoculars."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We don't
know what materials, do we?"

okay."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's this

[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I can't recall, where does
one find RATS antennas? I've fought a good number of RATS and none have come up
with one that was salvagable.. any tips?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Johnath~n, I think for the
antennas missi(n y% have to do a >est o# [ake their d@,tro< a[p-d missi\n too."

none of their ships seem to have them."

[General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I haven't gotten many
cores, either. Just must mean I am not that lucky."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So I got a response
from the revo tech about the patrol scanners."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What did they
tell you, Jacob?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What did they
say? I got a response from Accord, as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "What the tech told
me is probably the same as what they told you. They're standard kit for
patroling planets. They can do some very basic material ID stuff, but nothing
more than that. They're entirely non-suspicious and aside from the material ID,
they're just your standard electronic binoculars."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, that
roughly what they told me too."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That pretty much
clears a lot of that up then. We can probably conclude that best isn't using
these to have people thrown in jail."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He still
using it to find people who oppose him, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's true. Which
is worry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Er.. worrying in and
of itslf."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Itself. Stupid
comm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Either way,
it's a fear tactic to have battlesuits stalking the streets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When he could
just like, open a discussion with folks instead."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Agreed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Which is why I don't
think I'll be doing that again. The last thing I want to do is scare someone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Now I just need to
get my battle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Er battlesuit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, I'm
not or beheading folks, but we don't even know if that was those people. Those
folks you saw in cul de sac were probably pretty scared to see a battlesuit to
walk up on them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er not for
beheading folks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, probably. Poor
folks. In any case I couldn't have fired on them even if I'd wanted to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, were your
weapons disabled for the mission?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's at
least good news."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or.. do you
jus tmean because they were too small to target."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So far as I know,
people in battlesuits can't fire on people in general. I don't think you can
even fire on each other."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can fire
on each other."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh. Well then you
can't fire on people who aren't in suits then, I guess."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And for good reason.
We don't need any deaths."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We've
actually had to blow up people's suits when they've passed out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's not good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Also, my battle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Erm, my battlesuit
is at Endymion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So I might see if I
can have the tech at svp transfer it from there. Or is that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Mine's at SVP."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Is that even
possible? My comm hates me today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What? Have your
suit at SVP? Yes. There is an entire station there for it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "No no. That's not
what I meant."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Then I missed
what you meant..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I meant is it
possible for the tech to transfer it from Endymion to svp?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was going to
say, could ask."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ask a SVP."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's what I'm
about to do now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh they
might, yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sorry, I
always forget about the SVP guys."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, and they do
that shit for free."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"But it's been forever since I've been to SVP so don't quote me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll just keep it
there then unless I wanna do some lpd missions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yep, he totally did
it. That guy loves his job way too much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, he does.
Can't blame him though."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Awesome."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Well hell. I can see
why ships have a safety override for artificial gravity. I just turned mine off

"It's a great way to save power though if that becomes necessary."

find a chair with safety restraints installed. The one I have doesn't have them.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And wow. Does
artgrav really suck up that much juice?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes, it does."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Depends on the size of the ship and all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So, jacob. Where
was this patrol mission? I can't remember.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But man does it feel
strange to float around in your ship. What'd happen if those systems failed on a
beacon drop?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "They can be found on
new earth in the security office. But like I said before, I wouldn't try them
out even though you do get a decent payout for them."
tra 1 Yeah, it might be a bit more difficult to mash buttons very acurately and
quickly during  combat if one is floating around the ship.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah, it might be a bit more difficult to mash buttons very acurately and
quickly during combat if one is floating around the ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Not to mention that
some of the control boards might start flopping around and hit someone in the
face."
tra 1 I can just see it now. Gunners would have to tell the pilot, I would have
fired the lasers but I floated too far away.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"I can just see it now. Gunners would have to tell the pilot, I would have fired
the lasers but I floated too far away."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well! My
battlesuit is fully operational. Time to test it out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Johnathan, I suggest
doing the low-priority missions instead."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Hello everybody."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I would be
careful getting saftey restraints installed. Those are illegal. You can die, or
be seriously injured if your escape pod engages and you are strapped in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I can definitely
show you where they can be found. I need to do a couple myself at some point."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The Mutuality
lent that station to the Accord for their headquarters, but now they've
completed their command station, ti's not needed. So the Mutuality took it
back."

shop on the other side of the skim if you get a ride, and as long as it's not
something for your ship, since your ship's not supposed to be there."

in fear, you could tell the way it reacted that it was afraid of something."

the sanitation drone, but I've never seen them react that way before."

sanitation drones use to dispose of felo rather efficiently once upon a tie.

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, but if they get a letter
from somebody known to be a Rogue...they probably think...and maybe rightly so,
that it'll sell more issues if they mention the source where they got the info.

write to 'em."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both
biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist,
both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both
feet are left uncovered.

cores is an amazing way to get money."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Pocket change."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I turned in

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Accept I must have
reached today's limit, as the ship is not getting anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am half tempted
to actually rent a fighter and drop a beacon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The problem I
have is... where do I drop said beacon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I would do that, but
meh. Not the best at flying. Not fun."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a battle
scanner one sector west of the torus."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Do I drop it a
sector away from New Earth..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, don't do
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That would not be
good for us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do it within a
sector or two of the battle scanner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, I
understand that. Greatly... I, in most part, say it in response to a
conversation I had the other day... specific individuals "believing" Outsiders
aren't "a threat to humanity" anymore.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Tell that to my
dead brother."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is the
battle scanner?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I don't
think launching near New Earth would be a problem in that regard. The patrols
are relatively small and would probably fly away rather than attacking the
planet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes,
according to our president, unregs and pirates are a much bigger threat than
Outsiders."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The navy would
deal with them in short order if they did. The payout is just better by the
battle scanner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's one sector
west of the torus."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Only
the worst administration under Best makes that sort of claim. This is certainly
not the opinion held by the majority of pilots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The only place
you absolutely don't want to launch them in in mutuality space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Gives me an excuse
to hop in the fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys have
any simulator time?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Simulator time?
What's a... similator?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a combat
simulator at accord command. It's not strictly necessary, but it might be good
to run through once before facing outsiders."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Especially if
you haven't done any manual flying in combat yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... I've had
a lot of practice manual flying. I used RATS to simulate actual combat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "They're honestly
boring."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In general RATs
are a pretty poor substitute for outsiders, since they don't lock on you for
evasion practice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless they're
heavy fighters or reapers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But low strength
beacons aren't very dangerous."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll be fine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There
really is no reason for you all to caution anyone about launching decoy beacons
west of New Earth. The computer system would block that request. You can only
launch decoy beacons in gamma sectors and lower seacurity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If I am running
into heavy fighters or reapers for Outsiders.. I am in the wrong ship, dropping
the wrong becon...maybe?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. Like I
said, no reason to do that when the scanner is available. It's not a security
concern."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I mean any
RATs besides heavy fighters and reapers aren't good manual flying practice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Since there are
no locks to evade."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Outsider weapons
don't work the way RATs drills do."
tra 1 Yeah, Constantine is right. I can help you learn how to fly if you'd like.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah, Constantine is right. I can help you learn how to fly if you'd like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh,
there isn't a single RATS-CLASS starship that will be a test of anyone's flying
skills unless they're especially incompetent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's neck.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Meh. I just go by
the RAT, lack on, and blow it up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's
the difference between dealing with a pack of wild dogs and facing a group of
skilled fighters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "RATs just
come up on you and eat your ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Right. You don't even need to take the ship off of autopilot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Very true, Ather.
But, all the same, I found, flicking it into manual, then fly around a little is
a little good practice. But, pretty boring."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if you
feel comfortable, by all means give a beacon a shot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just be wary of
chains, if you get in trouble you might not be able to escape easily."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And if you're
not going through the sim first, I would at least recommend doing the weakest
beacon strength, so it's one-on-one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Chains... fun.
Right. Uh.. what else can you tell me about the beacons, specifically?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I don't see the
scanner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's not much
to them. You fire them off, then wait for the patrol to show up. It can be
several minutes. A lot of people like to wait near one end of the sector rather
than in the middle. This won't matter for low strength beacons, but it's a good
habit to get into for when you start doing higher ones, so that you don't get
surrounded."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Outsider thrall
ships will attach a chain to you to limit your flying range around them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Where do you buy
them?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Beacons that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons and
beacon launchers are sold at Accord command."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I couldn't afford
a ship armed with what would be required to take on anything higher then the
weakest beacon. Aside that, I don't have the points to warrent my bragging... Or
test my stupidity..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "We could tag team
one, Johnathon, I'd reckon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So, one thing
about them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If any ship
other than the ship that launches enters the sector, more enemies will show up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To reinforce the
initial patrol."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you can
definitely do beacons in multiple fighters, and it's fun, but be aware of that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll be facing
more enemies than usual."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure
what happens if multiple ships are present at the time the beacon is launched."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "More
ships definitely tend to show up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One thing to be
aware of is that in small ships without strong hull upgrades, a single hit will
likely knock out a turret."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you could
potentially lose a lot of combat strength each time you get hit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Hmm. Can't get
hull upgrades yet I don't think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Make sure you
have torpedos."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I have them."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
