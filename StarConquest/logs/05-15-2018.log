00:36 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

The glory of the endless expanse of starry space is revealed here through the transparent dome over this small but elegant restaurant. A spiral staircase in the center of the restaurant leads down to the main level of the station, and luxurious black carpeting covers the floor, extending outward to a long silver-trimmed black plasteel bar encircling the room. Cushioned black leather bar stools are arranged along the bar, and on the other side is a black plasteel waiter droid which moves with quiet efficiency to fill customers' orders. A two-meter-high wall of shiny black plasteel around the outside of the bar contains notices and a few other photographs and mementos. You see a framed photo of several pilots gleefully kicking a downed Outsider, a large glossy photo of a beautiful green planet in space, a small photograph of a pile of burning money, a large glossy AFW promotional poster, a large glossy framed photo of Benjamin Masterson, and a large sparkly white banner with 'Hapy Anibversery Piolets' scrawled across it in orange letters hanging on various walls.

23:39 Over the thumping bass and brushed drums of the jazz playing in the background, a muted trumpet plays a soulful, wandering melody.

23:39 Ather Jammoa says, "That'll drive that cruiser off too, if you all don't want to fight."

23:39 Constantine Stone takes a sip of a glass of chilled Vidal Blanc.

23:41 That doesn't seem to be a valid direction.

23:42 Professor Sonorous Griswold says, "Not a call I can make, I'm afraid! I am sure it would fall under 'aid and comfort' or some such and have deep repercussions."

23:42 Soft jazz plays quietly in the background with a soulful clarinet improvising on the melody.

23:42 Melinda says to Ather, "For what it's worth, the speech was good and I do hope it reaches the minds of your citizens."
