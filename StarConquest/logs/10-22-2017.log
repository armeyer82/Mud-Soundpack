01:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We can't just do it like one sector off from Orion?"

01:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "That's what I was thinking."

01:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah probably could."

01:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We can also run the op out of somewhere else, and just jump to Belt of Orion."

01:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah. That sounds good."

01:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes but we're onlyy using a destroyer so have to be careful."

01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, I remember when we used to have salvagers all over the place."

01:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It would just be difficult for us to get to them if they become invaded."

01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Asteroid haulers move it."

01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Would a cargo hauler?"

01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think only asteroid haulers can."

01:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not a cargo hauler to carry the canister."

01:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hrm. Ok."

01:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Didn't organizations have their own debris fields a long time agon eli?"

01:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah that's pretty low."

01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What about Battle of Mir?"

01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Will have to do it at Orion."

01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hamilton's Funnel has some decent chunks, but the density is kinda low."

01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "There's not much there to salvage."

01:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Anyway Jonathan, now you know why there aren't many of these salvage ops run from spaeports."

01:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yup."

01:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, true."

01:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What's the funnels grade?"

01:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "10-30."

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What about 777?"

01:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's hard to find salvagers who will want to salvage under 40 to 60 grade anymore and if you go out to 285 or 777, then we can't come rescue you with these bolt throwers and interdicting jerks."

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Will that draw too much attention?"

01:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes."

01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We may as well just do Orion, then."

01:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's too high for these cans."

01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

01:55 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:07 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

02:07 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

03:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:28 You must put the starship on manual control first.

03:28 I don't understand that.

03:28 Which sector did you mean?

03:28 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

03:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

03:28 Jonathan Triggs's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright. Lets finish this!"

03:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:28 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 'g;*dYZJ1zW)"d\=4[n}|y'4ZX+^|-b<hBgf"E~?
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:28 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

03:28 This ship is already on yellow status.

03:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:28 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:28 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

03:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:28 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:28 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

03:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:29 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:29 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:29 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:29 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

03:29 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

03:29 The computer reports that the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "Gunnar Land" has jumped into the sector.

03:29 Via general sector communication, League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2774 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northeast and Very Slightly Up."

16:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nice work and it depends on the mission. Destroying rats scouts would probably be better in a fighter."

16:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "You should be able to do that in a cargo hauler easily enough."

16:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Hm. I'll think on it, I've meant to get a fighter in case the hauler is too weak, anyway."

16:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Think the Accord ship got routed.. it seemed to have left before the IFS was destroyed. So, I ended up having to finish it off."

16:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "While it is possible to fight in an industrial ship, it's often not the best idea. It's good to get in the habit of using combat ships for combat and industrial ships for well... industrial activities."

16:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "The fighter was torpedos, and 2 more turrets."

16:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Right, that's what I was thinking too."

16:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I just asked since I really need cash. And not just salvaging or delivery cash."

16:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Now I think of it... I never used one torpedo on that IFS..."

16:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I can. And most certainly will. But when others aren't around, I want to be able to work on my own too."

16:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And I definitely understand about wanting to be able to work on your own. I'm famous for it."

16:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade gigggles and transmits, "make me famous for it too then."

16:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But at the same time, you don't have the points nor the cash to afford a good combat ship. We have access to them and they might as well be put to good use."

16:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Well, I do have cash for a fighter. But probably not the upgrades."

16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I'm still waiting on my application to be accepted, sadly."

16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Right, but more importantly, you don't have the points either."

16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And hopefully your paperwork will go through here soon."

16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Yeah, I doubt 24 points would get me much."

16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I don't want to sound super critical.. but, depending on your points.. you probably don't have the points to upgrade it that much, right now."

16:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Yeah. Probably not. But maybe I can practice flying in the sims so I won't need them right away."

16:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I'm hoping mine does, hey Shule?"

16:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What?"

16:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Paperwork going through."

16:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh yeah. Hope you giuys aren't cadets too much longer. Then the fun can really start."

16:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "For sure!"

16:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Yeah, I can't wait to be an official pilot."

16:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "So, where are the sims located?"

16:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "For future use."

16:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On AFW Command, near the southwest corner of the command ring."

16:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

16:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, southwest side."

16:54 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

16:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah ok."

16:54 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

17:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going, everyone?"

17:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Wishing my app wre accepted. Other than that all is well."

17:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Were... I can't talk today."

17:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah. I'm sure it will be soon enough."

17:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It's going. Took done my First IFS in my fighter.. with some assistance."

17:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "The assistance was an Accord destroyer."

17:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

17:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

17:30 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 285,917.12 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can the capsule rift drive break down?"

17:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And if so, can all the necessary repairs be made from inside?"

18:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

18:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh i've done better but it's ok."

18:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh have to wait over an hour to end this one."

18:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What are people up to?"

18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Delivering mail, since it's a bit less boring than salvaging."

18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm plundering the bubble."

18:44 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Toll Station from the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald". The organization has earned 1,713,420.98 credits.

18:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides north.

18:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Kim."

18:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi!"

18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How are you?"

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh, gee, I missed an important meeting and vote. Glad the option yes won though."

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not too bad."

19:12 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Toll Station from the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald". The organization has earned 2,384,731.74 credits.

19:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Be back. Just chhecking on things."

19:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What're the chances of organizing a Salvage op today, do you all think?"

19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "It it's out of the question for now... how about Nests or Beacons?"

19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No idea, can't think that far in advance!"

19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I really don't know."

19:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I am sure eli will be around later, same as Shule... and possiblely a few others from other alliances."

19:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I'd calculate Ather, but.. he's not around long."

19:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not that rigid concerning the work I do these days so if it happens, it will happen!"

19:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "True. But, planning needs to start sometime."

19:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not into planning jus tnow."

19:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Now that is."

19:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Planning something with a number of people is like herding cats. Ever try to do that in advance?"

19:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

19:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Heard cats... hmm..."

19:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I won't be doing much before midnight, I'm afraid."

19:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I best refrain from commenting further... about hearding cats.."

19:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah... that's I figured."

19:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "That's what I figured."

19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hey, constantine. I got one lens out of that Nest from the other day."

19:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

19:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Was hoping for one or two from the IFS I brought down.... no luck there."

19:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

19:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Anyone hauling 'roids or looking for Locals?"

19:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You can always ask over General or on Tactical."

19:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Probably general is best though."

19:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh, that I'll be doing. Just figured I'd check with my own alliance first.."

19:28 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Coming back on what lily said, planning ahead with pilots is a nightmare, maybe worse than hearding cats."

19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And I am not really sure what I wanna do."

19:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It can be hard to plan with more than a few people, yeah."

19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Who still has no access to the Starseekers warehouse? I thought I had given access to everyone?"

19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not really sure what parts they were missing or who was missing them, to be honest. Melinda told me you were running low, but when I checked the warehouse there were plenty of batteries and arrays."

19:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And when I asked her I didn't really get a straight answer."

19:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We're good, we have quite a few of everything now between both SEAS and Starseekers warehouses."

19:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Angel purchased about 25 different ones and we already had a fair numger in SEAS warehouse."

19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Where are these warehouses?"

19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "They can be accessed from the landing pad."

19:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only if you're authorized to access any to begin with, though."

19:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Ah, cool."

19:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, that is true."

19:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The warehouses are only accessible to organizations and are accessible form the Landing Pad."

19:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not sure probably Morris and his organization is Journey. I had to add him via his Organization Name and then I added him and provided his access it may be that if one isn't a Thane or a Vassal this will occur. I'm not sure of others."

19:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Morris definitely has access to the Starseekers warehouse."

19:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 164,453.07 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

19:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Justin."

19:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah well I had added Morris too but it didn't work so I had to remove his access and then add Journey and then I added Morris but I htink if you just add Journey, that will work."

19:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "What a bother. I won't be able to get a good battery, till I am able to get the Revo."

19:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fortunately the Revo doesn't require much."

19:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the north.

19:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident has automatically contributed 76,395,666.67 AEU credits.

19:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."

19:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident retrieves a virtual reality suit and puts it on.

19:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. that's trye."

19:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "True."

19:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes her virtual reality suit.

19:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident retrieves a virtual reality suit and puts it on.

19:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes her virtual reality suit.

19:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident places you on a large leather couch.

19:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident retrieves a virtual reality suit and puts it on.

19:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes her virtual reality suit.

20:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yo Eli."

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yo!"

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Hey eli."

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yo ho ho and a bottle of synthrum."

20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Eli!"

20:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hey it's a Kim."

20:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How is everybody this morning?"

20:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am doing ok, although it does not quite feel like morning for me right now."

20:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could use a bit of synthrum."

20:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Quite the ship... the Lowell is."

20:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I still wish I knew what happened that spawned those philosophy posts."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not that it matters I guess, they're all valid points. I'ts just sometimes things happen and the results make them seem bigger than they actually were."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh... probably some League put a bean under her hat."

20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Probably some people talking and someone giving a new pilot a lot of, something or another."

20:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for sure, the original post just makes it sound like someone gave a newer pilot some huge,  decked out ship."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Which is rediculous to do really. We all have to work to get there."

20:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Honestly I don't see anythign wrong with say, buying a cargo hauler in the exampel you gave, there's nothign wrong with how you handled it either. But there's a just gotta be a lien somewhere."

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan sacastically states, "Oh.. it was totally because someone hand gifted a Battlecruiser, with all the trimmings, to me."

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders laughs.

20:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow gimme that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Dude, what are we standing around here for then, let's fire that shit up."

20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I suppose I could have given a cargo hauler. But it was someone from another alliance who needed the help. And I had the time to spare."

20:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides north.

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs chuckles.

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, what you did makes complete sense Kim."

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I also could have taken him roid hauling, although, I don't think he quite had the points for that."

20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Reminds me of that guy who's always hanging out in the Fringe lounge, carrying on about how he stole a battlecruiser."

20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's like man, quit talking about it, and bust that shit out."

20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If we had a battle cruiser, I'd love to go show the outsiders what we could do with it."

20:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Speaking of which... does anyone have hydraulic pistons?"

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I might have some."

20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Oh... Apparently I have a couple... hmm.. wonder where I got those?"

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who stole a battlecruiser?"

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably disassembling RATS stuff or stuff from beacons."

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And from whom?"

20:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I have some hydraulic pistons, quite a few. Do you still need some?"

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles.

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "I could use a couple more.. possibly."

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Most of my hydraulic pistons probably come from landing gear sttrus."

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What is a couple?"

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah, I think that's where I got mine from."

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits an irritating burst of static.

20:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "2."

20:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles. "So a literal couple."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like it would be tough to get to the point where you have absolutely no resources."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can always do courier work."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And if you can afford a fighter you can deliver mail."

20:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well. It was like saturday when that happened, and the courier company only pays once a week, on friday."

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true."

20:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Still, a single low priority deployment would give you enough scratch to buy a fighter and start doing other stuff."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe he had no suit."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's also loans, but thhey may have not had their old loan paid off yet."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "He did not have a suit indeed. No ship, and not enough credits for even a fighter and he couldn't get a loan anymore either."

20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's true."

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Fortunately for AEU cadets we have that battlesuit loan that can be drawn on at any time by anyone, in any amount and for any reason."

20:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But don't clean it out!"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.
