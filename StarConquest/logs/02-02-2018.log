You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:29 Board what?

00:29 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:29 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:30 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

00:30 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:30 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:31 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

00:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:31 The ship is already moving.

00:31 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

00:31 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

00:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:31 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

00:31 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

00:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Five jumps to The Vortex. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:31 There appear to be about 29 pilots recently active.

00:31 The communicator network detects:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:44 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

You can go south, up, and out.

02:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or you could have offered to fly gunship but it's ok."

02:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I could have, but not really in the mood to fly right now."

02:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

02:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:43 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:43 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

02:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes and I guess we need to pay for the replacement of the aEU BAS as we have onenow."

02:44 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Have none that is."

02:44 You're already standing.
