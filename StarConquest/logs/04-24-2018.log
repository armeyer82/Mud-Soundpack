00:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on your shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

00:03 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

00:03 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

00:03 Melinda Michaels begins to write in a leather bound journal.

00:03 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

00:03 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

00:03 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

00:05 You stand up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:05 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

00:05 Melinda Michaels inks out another page in a leather bound journal.

00:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

00:14 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

00:15 Melinda Michaels puts a leather bound journal in a black canvas gear bag.

00:15 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

00:15 Melinda Michaels strides east.

00:16 Melinda Michaels strides in from the east.

00:16 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

00:16 Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

00:18 Melinda Michaels says, "Fringe has a cadet."

00:18 Melinda Michaels says, "New one."

00:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on your shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

00:23 Clarina Taylor stands up from a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies.

00:23 Clarina Taylor

00:23 She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has tan skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval, lightly-freckled, and lovely, with a button nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rose-pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and almond-shaped. Her shoulder-length, curly hair is auburn and hanging in a thick, fluffy mass over her shoulders. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, a wristwatch with a slim black leather band, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. She is also wearing an elegant gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a gold touch einrophone in a white reinforced plastic phone holster, and a black silk handbag embroidered with brightly hued dragons. Her face, both eyes, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

00:24 Clarina Taylor glides south.

00:24 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

00:24 Constantine Stone says, "Hey."

00:24 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

00:24 You wave to Constantine Stone.

00:24 Nissi Valdaire says, "Constantiiiine."

00:24 Constantine Stone asks, "How's it going?"

00:25 Constantine Stone sits down.

00:25 Melinda Michaels waves.

00:25 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Great!"

00:25 Melinda Michaels says, "'good here."

00:25 Melinda Michaels says, "We've got oh, probably four days travel yet."

00:25 Constantine Stone says, "Not too bad."

00:25 Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe 5."

00:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe 19."

00:26 Constantine Stone asks, "So is this rift umbilical big enough for one of us to pass through, or just it just tether the ships?"

00:26 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.
Melinda Michaels says, "If we hit a calm, yes 19."

00:26 Melinda Michaels grins.

00:26 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

00:26 Melinda Michaels says, "It just teathers the ships."

00:26 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

00:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Tethers."

00:27 Constantine Stone asks, "If we needed to, could we have Pierre's ship run with most systems cut so it could pull on the way home?"

00:27 Constantine Stone says, "Or are both drives needed."

00:27 Constantine Stone says, "I'm assuming we're pulling him now."

00:27 Melinda Michaels says, "We are."

00:28 Melinda Michaels says, "I'd guess both ships have systems cut because we are both losing charge. So, it wouldn't really matter."

00:28 Constantine Stone says, "I see."

00:28 Melinda Michaels says, "Nissi can correct me but, I think, the more systems are cut the lower our signal becomes."

00:29 Constantine Stone says, "For if we really want to sneak up on the Fwoof-foom."

00:29 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, have we had any contact with the FCI team yet?"

00:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Well given the course we are on, we may happen upon outsider patrols."

00:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes, there are three members aboard."

00:29 Constantine Stone asks, "Is Mike on this ship?"

00:29 Constantine Stone says, "I'd love to pick his brain."

00:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Nope, we've got the head guy."

00:30 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

00:30 Melinda Michaels says, "He played horrible people with us."

00:30 Melinda Michaels grins.

00:30 Ryan Thomas stands up from a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies.

00:30 Constantine Stone laughs.

00:30 Ryan Thomas stretches.

00:30 You grin.

00:30 Ryan Thomas says, "Back in just over an hour."

00:30 Ryan Thomas roams south.

00:33 Melinda says to Constantine, "Do you know the outsider evasion method?"

00:33 You say, "It's a good thing to know."

00:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah cause you never know which of us will be awake when and if it happens."

00:34 You say, "Yep."

00:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:35 Constantine Stone asks, "Evasion method?"

00:35 Constantine Stone says, "No."

00:36 Constantine Stone asks, "Just fly away immediately?"

00:36 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

00:37 Melinda Michaels says, "You want to drop your signature so trim to say 50 for starters, go on yellow and things like that."

00:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Then fly in a different direction than where you were spotted heading."

00:38 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, sail trim affects our signature?"

00:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

00:38 You nod.

00:38 You say, "IT does."

00:38 Melinda Michaels says, "I imagine most everything does, comms and all."

00:39 Constantine Stone asks, "Is yellow better than green for signature?"

00:39 Melinda Michaels says, "So lets say the flow was going east, we would want to try something like northwest so as to get the fastest escape with lower trim."

00:39 Constantine Stone says, "I see."

00:39 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes, yellow is the lowest."

00:39 You nod.

00:40 Melinda Michaels says, "And this is the mistake I made because though I had the basic info I just gave you, I didn't properly figure out the scans."

00:40 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, have we already been spotted once?"

00:40 Melinda Michaels says, "So I turned and the scans kept going louder with ships coming closer, so I turned."

00:40 Melinda Michaels says, "No this was some time ago."

00:41 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

00:41 Melinda Michaels says, "So pick your heading and stick with it."

00:41 Constantine Stone asks, "What do you mean by scans?"

00:41 Melinda Michaels says, "Long range scans."

00:41 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, ha! Tech I'm totally unfamiliar with."

00:41 Constantine Stone says, "Okay."

00:41 Melinda Michaels says, "When they kept coming closer, I turned."

00:41 Melinda Michaels says, "I screwed up."

00:41 Melinda Michaels says, "But came home and happily got the correct information."

00:42 Melinda Michaels says, "So."

00:42 Constantine Stone asks, "So you would just pick a heading and stick with it until they lose interest?"

00:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah. Gotta pick your direction and commit to it! Cuz you're in a bit of a race."

00:42 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes."

00:42 Constantine Stone nods.

00:42 Melinda Michaels says, "It's called learning from your mistakes."

00:43 Melinda Michaels smiles.

00:43 Constantine Stone says, "So you mean you were wise to the fact that they were following you while you were in the rift."

00:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "They go to where they think you were going when you dropped off their scan, as in when you reduced your signature."

00:43 Melinda Michaels nods.

00:43 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

00:43 You nod.

00:43 Constantine Stone says, "I didn't realize long-range scanners worked in the rift."

00:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "When they don't find you there, they head back toward the actual location you dropped off their scan."

00:43 Melinda Michaels nods.

00:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "So your goal is to be far enough away from your original location that they won't see you by the time they get there."

00:43 Melinda Michaels says, "So this evasion method works, however is not full proof."

00:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "While also avoiding their direction of travel."

00:43 You nod.

00:43 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, I see."

00:44 Constantine Stone says, "Interesting."

00:44 Constantine Stone asks, "Has anyone ever been caught?"

00:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes."

00:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Me."

00:44 Melinda Michaels laughs.

00:44 You chuckle.

00:44 Constantine Stone asks, "What kind of a patrol was it?"

00:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, many times."

00:44 Melinda Michaels says, "I think Nissi has too."

00:44 Constantine Stone asks, "Was it sort of like what you find on a beacon drop?"

00:44 You say, "Um no."

00:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "On the Ideran mission, I only evaded like... three out of four I think."

00:45 Nissi Valdaire says, "We got caught by one when we were almost out."

00:45 Melinda Michaels says, "I had to fly a slow ass Galleon against a rapid and some ass warpers. I think there may have been a chainer but don't recall."

00:45 Melinda Michaels says, "They hit me right away when we got pulled out of the rift but, otherwise, I flew okay."

00:46 Constantine Stone says, "Hmm."

00:46 Constantine Stone says, "I guess I better have a look around in a bit so I know where everything is in case of an incident."

00:46 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

00:46 You say, "Good idea."

00:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "Especially the bathroom."

00:46 Melinda Michaels grins.

00:46 Constantine Stone laughs.

00:46 You grin.

00:46 Constantine Stone sniffs at himself.

00:46 Constantine Stone says, "Just checking."

00:47 Nissi Valdaire grins.

00:47 Constantine Stone asks, "Is everyone I see on comms on one of the ships, or do we somehow have a link to the network out here?"

00:47 There appear to be about 21 pilots recently active.

00:47 The starship's computer and other communication links detect:
%Melinda Michaels  (E)
%Constantine Stone  (A)
%Shule Elemmire  (A) [m]
%Casen Thale  (A)

%Aisling the Fox  (M)

* == Out of communications range

% == Detected via Quantum Entanglement comm or Rift Link
Additionally, there are 13 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 34 pilots.

00:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Part of my problem was, we were all first timers and I had everyone telling me what to do while I was trying to do it and watch them getting closer."

00:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Everyone had different ideas."

00:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Some are back home cuz we got the QE connection too."

00:48 Melinda Michaels says, "Talk into that rift comm mic."

00:48 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

00:48 Constantine Stone asks, "Rift comm mic?"

00:48 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:48 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yo there."

00:48 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ahoy."

00:48 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yo there."

00:48 Constantine Stone leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:48 The voice of Constantine Stone comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hello."

00:49 The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yo."

00:49 Melinda Michaels says, "So the key is that, if we cannot evade, we need to destroy them all."

00:49 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'm sorry the crew of Zero Charts is away at the moment. Please leave a message after the beep."

00:50 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:50 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hello from sunny Blackwing Yalobusha, wish you were here."

00:50 Melinda Michaels says, "If one gets away, they may send out, wht's it called, wolfpack I think Akemi called it."

00:50 The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Life here is very stealthy."

00:51 The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And full of tentacles."

00:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Plus we don't want them tracking us to our destination."

00:51 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "So stealthy, in fact, we don't even notice it passing by."

00:51 Constantine Stone asks, "True. When do we decide our attempts to run have failed and give up and fight? If they don't seem to be fooled by us reducing our signature?"

00:52 Constantine Stone asks, "Or would you try running a few times before resorting to fight in these ships?"

00:52 Constantine Stone asks, "Or do they yank us out of the rift somehow, forcing our hand?"

00:52 Melinda Michaels says, "I think Gonzo got away with them passing light-cycles from him."

00:52 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll get yanked out if they get close enough."

00:53 Constantine Stone says, "Hmm, okay."

00:53 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.

00:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "I think they'd probably change headings again if they spot you... then you open up the trim and run for a bit while you power stuff up."

00:53 Constantine Stone says, "Right."

00:53 Melinda Michaels nods.

00:54 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

00:54 Hawthorn Dunn waves sleepily as he walks into the observation deck, rubbing his chin.

00:54 Melinda Michaels navigates her indigo slider einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

00:54 Hawthorn Dunn lies down on a nylon relaxation hammock.

00:56 A pleasing, throbbing warmth suffuses your body.

00:57 Hawthorn blinks and then slowly squirms a little, mumbling, "What...the fuck?"

00:58 Melinda Michaels beams.

00:58 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just let it feel good."

00:58 Melinda Michaels says, "So when I figured we'd need to fight this is what I did."

00:58 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, you guys felt that too?"
"I...mean it feels like.... like yunno what I mean, right... like," Hawthorn coughs then flushes. "Uh. Yeah."

00:58 Constantine Stone says, "I didn't want to say anything."

00:59 Melinda Michaels says, "With the available crew awake, I had an engineer and two gunners on the Galleon with me. Then I picked the two best fighter pilots we had awake to launch the moment we exited the rift."

00:59 Melinda Michaels says, "And yeah, it's the sexy scene."

00:59 Melinda Michaels laughs.

00:59 You laugh.

00:59 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

00:59 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, Turbo the arachnoid security robot, and a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.
Nissi Valdaire and Melinda Michaels are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Constantine Stone is seated. Hawthorn Dunn is lying on a nylon relaxation hammock.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

01:00 I see no "lily" here.

01:00 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

01:00 Melinda Michaels glances around at her surroundings. "It's, colorful."

01:00 You say, "It sure is that."

01:00 You chuckle.

01:01 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

01:01 Lily Kaise waves.

01:01 Melinda Michaels waves to Lily Kaise.

01:01 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

01:01 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Lily Kaise!"

01:01 Lily says to Nissi, "V!"

01:01 Constantine Stone waves.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "This is like wow..."

01:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on your shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:01 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:01 Lily Kaise says, "I meant Nissi V."

01:01 Lily Kaise grins.

01:02 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "Good enough!"

01:02 Lily Kaise smiles.

01:02 Lily Kaise waves to Constantine Stone.

01:02 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:02 I don't see that here.

01:02 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:03 Lily says to Nissi, "Would Constantine be able to get the Jumpsuit and things?"

01:03 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, jumpsuits."

01:03 Constantine Stone asks, "Did we get those?"

01:03 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

01:03 Lily Kaise says, "Well we can try."

01:03 You say to Constantine, "Yeah, they were in the docking bay last I heard."

01:04 Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

01:04 Lily Kaise says, "Did you get yours Constantine."

01:04 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:04 Constantine Stone says, "Well, I've go have a look in a bit."

01:04 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:04 Constantine Stone says, "No, not yet."

01:04 Lily Kaise says, "Ok then they are in the Docking Bay."

01:04 The voice of Aisling the Fox comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Is time for a nap."

01:04 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:04 You say over the linked rift comm, "Rest well."

01:04 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:04 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Enjoy napping."

01:05 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:05 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:05 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Are people talking in other galleon? Evenia said we are not talking enough."

01:05 Nissi Valdaire says, "And yeah, that stuff is in the docking bay."

01:05 Nissi Valdaire says, "Beer too."

01:05 Constantine Stone says, "Ooh, nice."

01:05 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

01:05 Constantine Stone says, "You never hear from me again."

01:05 The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Have you spaced anyone yet?"

01:05 Lily Kaise points at a hardened hatch cracker.

01:05 Lily Kaise says, "'uh."

01:05 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:05 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Sometimes. Some quiet times. Usual trip stuff."

01:05 Lily Kaise points at a blue knitted cap.

01:06 Lily Kaise points at a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots.

01:06 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, it's like a whole uniform."

01:06 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We have more quiet than anything else. Maybe it is stealthy galleon causing people to be quiet."

01:06 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

01:06 Lily Kaise exclaims, "And beer!"

01:06 Constantine Stone says, "I wonder if the Fwoof-foom have bands."

01:06 You nod and grin.

01:06 Constantine Stone says, "I brought my mandolin."

01:06 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

01:07 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm 'hmm don't know where I left my Mandolin."

01:10 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

01:10 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Okay this is ridiculous."

01:10 Hawthorn squirms a little more on the hammock.

01:11 Melinda Michaels asks, "Go visit your quarters for a bit of, alone time?"

01:11 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:11 You chuckle.

01:11 Melinda Michaels says, "I can't wait to see what they look like."

01:12 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Is it bad that I am hoping they're fluffy or fuzzy, or...I dunno, floofy?"

01:12 Melinda Michaels says, "Me too."

01:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on your shoulder.

01:12 Melinda Michaels grins.

01:12 Lily Kaise nods.

01:12 You grin.

01:13 Constantine Stone says, "I imagine them looking like Old Earth bears."

01:13 Constantine Stone says, "But with rabbit ears."

01:13 Melinda Michaels giggles.

01:13 Lily Kaise chuckles at Constantine Stone.

01:14 Lily says to Constantine, "Let's hope they don't have strong back feet the better to rabbit kick you with."

01:14 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "I wonder fi they're going to be like uniquely colored. Like maybe different colors to determine social standing?"

01:14 Constantine says to Lily, "Yeah!"

01:14 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:14 You chuckle.

01:14 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe."

01:15 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

01:15 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm just...imagining these gigantic colored sentiant fluff ba....oh c'mon please rift...gimme a break..."

01:16 Constantine Stone says, "The fwoof foom are reaching out to you from across the rift."

01:17 Hawthorn Dunn says, "That is not the kind of reach out I'm looking for..."

01:17 Constantine Stone chuckles.

01:18 Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:18 The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "So i'm curious to know. Are you guys experiencing the same rift experience as we are at this current moment?"

01:18 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "The colors?"

01:18 The tingling of your nerves intensifies.

01:18 The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I feel tingly."

01:18 Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "...huh... yeah."

01:19 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "That's a yes, then."

01:19 The voice of Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And warm."

01:19 Constantine says to Melinda, "How do you know when to be worried about a patrol getting on us. Will the ship notify you that it's been pinged by a scanner or something?"

01:21 Hawthorn Dunn says, "There is a lot lot lot of pinging."

01:22 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

01:22 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

01:22 Lily Kaise nods.

01:22 Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:22 The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "This is really... I don't know what to do with myself..."

01:22 The voice of Cheri Lindbergh comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, first you go somewhere private..."

01:22 You chuckle.

01:23 Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:23 The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Heh heh."

01:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around your neck.

01:25 You carefully remove a Tardick lizard named Asteria from your shoulder.

01:25 You give a Tardick lizard named Asteria to Lily Kaise.

01:25 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:25 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:25 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

01:26 Lily says to you, "You could have held her longer if you had wanted to. She won't bite you hard..."

01:26 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:26 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:26 You say to Lily, "I know."

01:26 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:26 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

01:26 Lily Kaise says, "Mmm."

01:26 You grin at Lily Kaise.

01:26 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:26 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I would like one of those rift bubbles now."

01:26 Lily Kaise says, "Not I."

01:27 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:27 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You have a mate over there. Take advantage of the rift fun."

01:27 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

01:27 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

01:27 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "He's....uh....He's asleep."

01:27 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:27 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ah so is mine."

01:28 Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:28 The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You should stroke him to wakefulness."

01:28 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hahaha."

01:28 Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:28 The voice of Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Like his, back I mean. You know."

01:28 The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Right. Mmhmm."

01:32 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:32 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, Turbo the arachnoid security robot, and a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.
Nissi Valdaire and Melinda Michaels are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Constantine Stone is seated. Hawthorn Dunn is lyin
01:32 g on a nylon relaxation hammock. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

01:34 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

01:34 Hawthorn Dunn waves to Gonzales Bourne.

01:35 Lily Kaise says, "There are a few Riftscapes that I don't enjoy but most are wave gonz."

01:35 Gonzales Bourne waves.

01:35 Lily Kaise waves to Gonzales Bourne.

01:35 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Gonzales bask in the bliss..."

01:35 I don't see that here.

01:35 You wave to Gonzales Bourne.

(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

01:36 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Now we're...huh."

01:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:40 Melinda Michaels nods to Gonzales Bourne.

01:41 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

01:41 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

01:41 Melinda Michaels strides south.

01:41 Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

01:41 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

01:41 Melinda Michaels says, "Took the jib down."

01:42 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, this ship has more than one sail?"

01:42 Constantine Stone says, "That's awesome."

01:42 Melinda Michaels says, "Jib helps if the rift is coming at you, slowing you down."

01:42 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah."

01:42 Lily Kaise nods to Constantine Stone.

01:43 Lily Kaise exclaims, "It really is!"

01:43 Hawthorn Dunn says, "It has three I think."

01:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yup."

01:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Mizzen helps if you are getting drift, like if the rift is at your back and you are going very fast."

01:44 Constantine Stone asks, "Is this the only ship with multiple sails?"

01:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes."

01:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "I only use the mizzen when it's coming sideways. In theory drift should be zero with an exact tailwind."

01:44 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

01:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "Of course it's never exact, but still, it shouldn't be much."

01:45 Melinda Michaels says, "Sideways, not behind. I do it right but never explain it right."

01:45 Melinda Michaels shrugs.

01:45 Nissi Valdaire grins.

01:45 Melinda Michaels says, "I used to do it sideways and behind till I learn you don't get pushed backwards."

01:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah."

01:46 Melinda Michaels says, "I dunno who used to teach that you did but it confused a lot of us. It may have been Reets but I don't remember."

01:46 Lily Kaise grins.

01:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "I dunno. A lot of people like saying it."

01:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "People who stare at the NDB constantly make it worse. They forget the number going down can also mean going sideways. And in fact does."

01:48 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I think I got confused, but, that's interesting."

01:48 You say, "True."

01:48 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I learned that on the last trip I was at."

01:48 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "On?"

01:48 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Something."

01:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:55 Melinda Michaels nods.

01:55 Melinda Michaels says, "NDB is a good tool to use but it's nondirectional for a reason."

01:56 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

01:57 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

01:57 You wave to Keegan Wantz.

01:58 Keegan Wantz says, "Allo."

01:58 Keegan Wantz says, "I have successfully spider webbed a shower."

01:58 Keegan Wantz sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

01:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:59 Melinda Michaels laughs.

01:59 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:59 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "How y'all doing over there?"

02:00 Keegan Wantz says, "If a shower is actually spider webbed, I will be very confused."

02:00 Keegan Wantz coughs.

02:00 Keegan Wantz says, "Left Kai Junior at home for several reasons."

02:00 Melinda Michaels grins. "I'd say so."

02:00 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I am gazing at rising speed number with satisfaction."

02:00 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:00 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Good."

02:00 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh dear."

02:01 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Ohhh we can hear the NDBs down here!"

02:01 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh nice."

02:01 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Did you hear anything nice from your support team? Ours has been quiet so far."

02:01 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh."

02:01 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:01 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Quiet so far."

02:02 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:02 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ian checked the heading for us, at least!"

02:02 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "He came to visit when you stopped?"

02:02 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:02 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yup, when the drive broke. We had 127 LTC's to go."

02:03 Hawthorn Dunn says, "How many have we gone through so far? I didn't get the last numbers."

02:03 Melinda Michaels says, "It was around 18 when the drive broke."

02:03 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I must learn art of long-distance sensorship."

02:03 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ah, gotcha. So we're not making terrible time."

02:03 Melinda Michaels says, "Na."

02:03 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:03 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "That would be great."

02:04 Nissi Valdaire says, "Oh yeah. Hm. I wonder what our distance traveled was two hours ago."

02:05 Nissi Valdaire says, "I meant to check."

02:05 Nissi Valdaire removes an atlas-sized light brown leather-bound book with the title embossed in black and the pages edged in silver gilt from a black leather shoulder bag stitched with silver stars and decorated with steel studs.

02:05 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "This would be slightly harder without the rift link. Just a little."

02:05 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:05 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yup, a little."

02:05 Melinda says to Nissi, "What's that?"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

02:21 Lily Kaise says, "M'magellan feed lizard."

02:21 Magellan the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Unknown command. Please ask for 'help.'"

02:21 You're already sitting.

02:21 I don't understand that.

02:21 Lily Kaise says, "Oopooc heh i'll never figure this one out."

02:21 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:22 Keegan Wantz slumps on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it and goes to sleep.

02:22 Clarina Taylor takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

02:22 Ryan Thomas takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

02:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:23 Lily Kaise says, "I dislike domestic work and I don't mind admitting that I'd rather spend money to have it done for me."

02:23 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:24 Clarina Taylor says, "I use the tedium of it. The routine is easy and you don't have to think too hard while doing chores. It's a good time to think about other things."

02:28 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

02:28 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Magellan caretake for 100 years!"

02:28 Magellan the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order confirmed."

02:28 Magellan the arachnoid security robot stops following Lily Kaise.
Magellan the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "I shall watch over the living beings on this ship as if they were my own."

02:28 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

02:28 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:28 Lily Kaise says, "Right."

02:28 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

02:28 Melinda Michaels considers Turbo the arachnoid security robot thoughtfully.

02:28 Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

02:29 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Christ."

02:29 Hawthorn Dunn stares at Magellan the arachnoid security robot.

02:29 Hawthorn Dunn says, "For some reason that's really creepy to me."

02:29 Clarina Taylor asks, "Which part?"

02:29 Clarina Taylor asks, "The taking care of them as if they were her own?"

02:29 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I will watch over the wahtever whatever."

02:29 Clarina Taylor asks, "Or his?"

02:29 Clarina Taylor says, "Or its."

02:29 Ryan Thomas takes a sip of a glass of cold fizzy cola.

02:29 Clarina Taylor shrugs.

02:29 Clarina Taylor takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

02:29 Lily Kaise says, "Caretaking is great otherwise I may not have any felo when I get back home to defend against bari."

02:29 Ryan Thomas says, "Oh shit my felo."

02:30 Ryan Thomas stands up from a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies.

02:30 Ryan Thomas roams south.

02:30 Clarina Taylor snickers.

02:30 Ryan Thomas roams in from the south.

02:30 Ryan Thomas says, "Got him."

02:30 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "Fuck!"

02:30 Clarina Taylor asks, "Hmm?"

02:30 Ryan Thomas says, "He died."

02:30 Melinda says to Ryan, "What's wrong?"

02:30 Ryan Thomas puts a black digital felo game in a desert camouflage canvas Fringe gear bag.

02:30 Clarina Taylor says, "Oh noo."

02:30 Ryan Thomas says, "My felo died."

02:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh haha."

02:30 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Thank the stars!"

02:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh felo game."

02:30 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "Careful, lily. Them's fighting words!"

02:30 Ryan Thomas grins.

02:31 Lily Kaise grins at Ryan Thomas.

02:31 Clarina Taylor takes a bite of a serving of hot macaroni and cheese in a shallow bowl.

02:31 Ryan Thomas removes a black digital felo game from a desert camouflage canvas Fringe gear bag.

02:31 Ryan Thomas presses a button on a black digital felo game.

02:31 A black digital felo game goes blank for a moment, then resets with a series of beeps.

02:31 Ryan Thomas presses a button on a black digital felo game.

02:31 A black digital felo game beeps repeatedly as the felo chases around a tiny digital ball!

02:31 Ryan Thomas stands up from an oval navy blue area rug.

02:31 Ryan Thomas sits down on a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies.

02:33 Melinda Michaels nods to Ryan Thomas.

02:33 Ryan Thomas says, "Hung out with reets."

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

02:33 Lily Kaise says, "Who changed her name from Berry to Elizabeth."

02:33 Clarina Taylor says, "That is a very very very very very unfortunate last name."

02:33 Ryan Thomas laughs.

02:33 Ryan Thomas asks, "Wasn't she on gray's expidition?"

02:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Na."

02:33 Clarina Taylor shakes her head.

02:33 Ryan Thomas says, "I've only seen her a handfull of times, but I remember the name."

02:34 Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

02:34 Morris Corlew waves.

02:34 Clarina Taylor exclaims, "Hi, MOrris!"

02:34 Ryan Thomas says, "Hey, man."

02:34 Morris Corlew says, "Hey."

02:34 Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

02:34 Melinda Michaels waves.

02:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

02:34 Clarina Taylor finishes off a serving of hot macaroni and cheese in a shallow bowl.

02:34 Morris Corlew says, "Oh, we stopped."

02:34 Clarina Taylor gives a bowl to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

02:35 Lily says to Magellan the arachnoid security robot, "Ok you dumbshit give it up!"

02:35 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:35 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

02:35 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

02:35 Melinda Michaels considers Turbo the arachnoid security robot thoughtfully.

02:35 Melinda Michaels says, "Turbo repair."

02:37 Lily Kaise says, "Magellan shovel."

02:37 Magellan the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Unknown command. Please ask for 'help.'"

02:37 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

02:37 Lily Kaise glides south.

02:37 Ryan Thomas asks, "Can we break the robot?"

02:37 Clarina Taylor says, "Tsk tsk."

02:37 I don't understand that.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

02:53 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Turbo the arachnoid security robot here.
Constantine Stone is seated. Hawthorn Dunn is lying on a nylon relaxation hammock. Keegan Wantz and Nissi Valdaire are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow. Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug. Ryan Thomas and Clarina Taylor are sitting on a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered. Melinda Michaels is standing here.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

02:53 Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

02:53 Morris Corlew says, "I have Elk, Deer, and Caribou."

02:56 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a bite of a serving of hot spicy red beans and rice in a shallow bowl.

03:05 You snuggle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Aww."

03:05 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

03:05 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, speed."

03:05 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah a lot nicer than me!"

03:05 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:05 FCI Scout Nissi Valdaire says, "I am a medical doctor now."

03:07 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:07 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "No."

03:08 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:08 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I mean, why would we for this heading?"

03:08 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "The really cool thing is, when you do, we see it's exact angle on ours. It's almost creepy."

03:08 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, that's why I was asking."

03:08 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Well dude isn't that what you're supposed to if you're tethered to us?"

03:08 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:08 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

03:08 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "He must think we're dumb."

03:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew looks at FCI Scout Melinda Michaels and shrugs.

03:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "Seriously dumb!"

03:09 A gust of wind blows through the ship, blowing strands of sticky silk like streamers.

03:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smirks.

03:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I mean...if it shows over there, he could just check it there and know."

03:11 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels grins.

03:11 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "At this current flow, you could match jib with the main heading to very slightly reduce drift at no speed reduction. I am not sure if it would help all that much, though."

03:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Sean's back."

03:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:12 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yup we could match headings but I don't think we need to have it up."

03:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:12 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Johann. If y'all were worried bout Sean, check your comm."

03:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:12 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Let me check."

03:13 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

03:13 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides south.
Turbo the arachnoid security robot skitters after FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

03:14 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I saw. I was...so relieved. I just gotta hope Brunhilda takes him to Eve. If Eve is still..."

03:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:14 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Could send a QE or somethin."

03:15 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I thought about it, but I didn't figure it was decent use of the qe."

03:15 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Mizzen and jib down and set to our heading."

03:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:15 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I mean...talk to your captain. Did you write him or anythin fore you left? If so, I'm sure he's got that."

03:15 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

03:15 Turbo the arachnoid security robot skitters in after FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

03:15 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:16 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Man he vanished so long ago...I think I did, maybe."

03:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:16 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:16 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Putting jib up slows us only by 10 or 15 speed so, not much of help."

03:18 The voice of FCI Scout Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "It would help if we had an Akemi-level of heading that needs the very minimum of drift."

03:19 An insectile chittering echoes from the distance.

03:20 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:20 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Would be nice but we aren't so lucky to have that."

03:26 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor drinks the last of a can of lemon iced sweet tea.

03:26 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor gives an empty beverage can to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a bite of a serving of hot spicy red beans and rice in a shallow bowl.

03:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

03:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip from a can of strawberry lemonade.

03:29 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

03:30 Lily winces.

03:30 FCI Scout Morris Corlew wriggles his fingers.

03:30 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

03:30 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

03:30 FCI Scout Nissi Valdaire yawns!

03:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:30 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor nods to FCI Scout Nissi Valdaire.

03:30 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "I agree."

03:30 FCI Scout Nissi Valdaire says, "Mm."

03:31 FCI Scout Nissi Valdaire finishes off a small hot pepperoni pizza.

03:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew finishes off a serving of hot spicy red beans and rice in a shallow bowl.

03:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gives a bowl to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

03:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels takes a sip of a glass of cold lemonade.

03:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels finishes off a glass of cold lemonade.

03:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

03:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip from a can of strawberry lemonade.

03:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Hungry Tegan."

04:19 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

04:19 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:19 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

04:21 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

04:21 Melinda says to Kani, "Did you have a nice rest?"

04:21 Gonzales Bourne says, "The idea of having an ally against outsiders really excites me. Chances are it might have no effect whatsoever, but it also might be a game changer."

04:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz stretches.

04:21 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods to Gonzales Bourne. "I agree."

04:23 Gonzales Bourne says, "Hawthorn was asking questions about such stuff so maybe he did."

04:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I have one, yeah. And discs. You're welcome to borrow it. I brought it more so somebody could...I'm probably really crappy with it."

04:24 Kani Kahakai says, "I think Hawthorn was planning some sort of documentary."

04:24 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I just haven't been to the shop so I am not familiar with them."

04:24 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stands up.

04:31 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

04:31 Gonzales Bourne salutes sharply.

04:31 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Okay so it's like 2:30 in the morning and we are the crazy pilots who are still awake on this, our second day of the FCI mission. So, y'all tell me what you think about this here mission."

04:31 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

04:31 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

04:32 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

04:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "I'm excited. I mean...the opportunity of a lifetime and then some. Potential allies in the fight against the Outsiders. What could be better'n that?"

04:33 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "We've got quiet pilots."

04:33 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

04:33 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

04:33 Melinda says to Gonzales, "C'mon, you're the one that gave me the idea."

04:33 You say to a copy of "Here, Let Me Help You - A Guide For People Who Are Bad at Rift Drives", "Loc."

04:33 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "And we have found an oort."

04:34 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

04:35 FCI Scout Lily Kaise tickles you!

04:36 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe the rift will tell us what it thinks."

04:37 You grin.

04:37 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Y'all are supposed to have these big like profound statements."

04:37 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

04:37 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

04:37 Gonzales Bourne says, "I am actually optimistic about this mission. It appears that once upon a time this race was ahead of us as they managed to defeat outsiders before us. However we don't know a whole lot and at this point the best we can do is hope and occasionally hop. Even if we don't end up becoming allies, I think it'll be comforting to know that we are not alone in this fight."

04:37 Gonzales Bourne gestures vaguely.

04:38 Melinda says to Gonzales, "Very nice."

04:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise gives Gonzales Bourne a high five.

04:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

04:38 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Um like...I will not at all be surprised if the Foof-Fwoom are not at all poofy or floofy or fluffy. Not one bit. Probably."

04:38 Gonzales says to Melinda, "Of course. I said it."

04:38 Gonzales Bourne chortles.

04:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

04:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "They are going to look different than we think."

04:38 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

04:39 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Was sayin yesterday, what if they're rod thin, bald, and shiny? Or even made of energy?"

04:39 Melinda gazes out the viewport in thought. "I'll go with they are big squishy cuddly beings."

04:39 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins at FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

04:39 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Kani Kahakai's shoulder.

04:40 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Foof-Fwoom sounds floofy, sure. But...that's Esperanto makes it sound thataway. In the Fwoofese, it could be indicative of a puddle. Liquid creatures."

04:40 FCI Scout Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

04:40 Gonzales Bourne says, "All I know is eventually the universe will be ruled by cats. So if outsiders are afraid of them, there is a great chance that we're visitting kittens."

04:40 FCI Scout Morris Corlew points at FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

04:40 FCI Scout Morris Corlew points at Kani Kahakai.

04:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

04:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels sighs at FCI Scout Morris Corlew.

04:41 Morris says to Melinda, "Sometimes I don't hear so good! I thought you said 'There may be kittens.'"

04:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Yup, our documentary will rock. It's full of craziness."

04:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

04:42 Gonzales says to Morris, "Not capitalist cats! Furball ones."

04:42 You say, "Well, time for me to head to bed. Night all."

04:42 You stand up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:42 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods to you.

04:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Capitalist cats?"

04:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:58 FCI Scout Lily Kaise gives a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger to Magellan the arachnoid security robot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

04:58 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Magellan repair."

04:58 Magellan the arachnoid security robot says in a synthesized voice, "Unknown command. Please ask for 'help.'"

04:58 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

04:58 You chuckle.

05:01 You say to Lily, "Well, I'll say good night. I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:01 FCI Scout Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:01 You kiss FCI Scout Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:01 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. I so love you! Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:02 You say to Lily, "Night my love. Rest well and sweet dreams to you too. I love you too."

05:02 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

05:02 You wrap your arms around FCI Scout Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise beams at you.

05:04 You say to Lily, "Night babe."

05:04 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles at you.

05:04 Lily says to you, "Nite Babe."

05:05 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

05:07 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

05:17 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

05:19 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

05:29 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

05:33 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

05:33 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

05:40 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

05:47 FCI Scout Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

05:47 FCI Scout Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

05:48 FCI Scout Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

05:52 FCI Scout Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

06:02 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

06:13 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

06:23 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

06:25 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

06:35 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

06:35 Listen. You need to be careful.

07:00 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

07:09 Remember what I said.

07:09 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:09 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

07:12 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

07:12 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:12 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

07:13 Steam begins to slowly drift upward from the river, then bubbles rise to the top -- the water is boiling!

07:13 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

07:13 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

07:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

07:15 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

07:15 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:16 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sensors down to 81%."

07:16 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

07:21 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

07:21 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:22 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

07:28 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

07:28 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:28 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

07:34 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

07:34 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

07:35 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

07:35 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:36 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't do the inside with them."

07:36 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

07:36 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

08:01 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:01 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:02 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:02 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

08:02 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

08:02 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

08:02 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:06 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:06 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

08:10 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

08:10 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:10 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

08:12 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

08:12 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:12 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

08:17 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

08:17 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:17 Listen. You need to be careful.

08:21 Remember what I said.

08:21 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:21 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

08:24 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

08:24 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:24 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

08:31 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

08:31 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:32 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

08:35 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

08:35 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:35 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

08:39 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

08:39 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:39 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

08:41 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

08:41 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:41 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

08:42 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

08:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "2.22, Mel."

08:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

08:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:54 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:54 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:54 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:54 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

08:55 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wendy?"

08:56 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mhm... yeah?"

08:56 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am standing in the quarters entry if you could come here for just one quick sec."

08:56 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

08:56 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

08:56 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

08:57 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Maybe we're heading to that one!"

09:00 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

09:00 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:00 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

09:02 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

09:02 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:02 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

09:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:04 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

09:04 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:04 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

09:07 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

09:07 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:07 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

09:10 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

09:10 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:10 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

09:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:17 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

09:17 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:17 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

09:19 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

09:19 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:22 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

09:22 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:22 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

09:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:29 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

09:30 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey! I hope they are not party poopers!"

09:30 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

09:34 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

09:34 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:36 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:36 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

09:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:41 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

09:41 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:44 Listen. You need to be careful.

09:46 Ah, back to normal.

09:46 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

09:46 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

09:50 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay storm is over, nap time for me."

09:50 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well. Gonna take Kani with ya?"

09:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:53 Remember what I said.

09:53 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

09:53 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

10:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:19 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

10:20 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

10:22 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We got a malfunction?"

10:22 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No. They have their third."

10:23 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hah."

10:25 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

10:25 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

12:09 You hear something fall in the next room.

12:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:19 You hear something fall in the next room.

12:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:28 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

12:35 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

12:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:58 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

13:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

13:08 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning..."

13:08 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning."

13:08 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

13:09 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Whoa! God why wake up to this... god, fucking rift."

13:09 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Poor guy."

13:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

13:18 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

13:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:29 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

13:30 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

13:30 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

13:35 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wait, is that Ali Candan of Ali Candan fame!?"

13:36 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Huh?"

13:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:38 Wendy Arroyo's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What."

13:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:00 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

14:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

14:08 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

14:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:19 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

14:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

14:29 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

14:32 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

14:32 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

14:33 Nissi Valdaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anybody know how far we traveled before dropping out before?"

14:33 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

14:33 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uh... not sure."

14:34 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

14:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

14:38 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

14:41 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Objects and walls inside the ship seem faintly translucent, and when in your periphery seem to disappear completely, replaced with perfect blue sky and puffy white clouds. The ship flies as part of a flock, birds stretching off into the distance. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

First thing, welcome to the FWOOF-FOOM FCI. Now lets get the good stuff out of the way.

We are here as a group to do what we can to make peaceful contact with this race. This means, evasion methods should be practiced should we come across something that isnt friendly. We have brought along the combat ships as a precaution because we simply dont know for sure what is out there. The hope is that the outsiders have cleared out and we have a nice safe trip in. In other words, hope for peace but be ready for defense.

Next, behave like sensible adults or you could have a nice ride home in a pod. While we want everyone to relax and enjoy the trip, it is one of a very important and serious nature. Typical drama and other methods of causing tension and anger within the crew will not be tolerated.

If we can land and begin to learn about this race, please do not be stupid. We dont know their likes, dislikes and what may make or break the start of a good relationship. This means that we must be smart as we attempt to communicate and learn more about them.

Know your place. This is Nissis ship, therefore she gets to pull rank over all of you if necessary. Myself, Pierre and Alexander are the mission managers, not you. Speaking for myself, I can say that I have done a lot of prep work to ensure that this mission goes off smoothly. I ask that you do your utmost to assist us with this mission rather than hinder it. I selected you as a crewmember because I thought you would be an asset, dont prove me wrong.

Our goal is to make contact with FWOOF-FOOM, gain some trust, and hopefully make some more friends in the fight against the outsiders. We may be able to share ideas and even tech that could better both our positions in this fight. So, lets make a good effort and hopefully come away with a good start to a friendly relationship and foundation for strengthening us in the fight that really matters.

This will be our first run using the new rift link technology. If you wake up and see we are out of the rift, don't touch the controls. We will want to get confirmation that both ships have a working rift drive before we attempt to take off. We will have people who are there for navigation and they will know who they are. Also, you will know if you are on the initial landing team. This team will make sure everyone is good to leave the ships and make initial contact. We will also hopefully have negotiations ongoing and you will know if you are on that team. We will do our best to make sure someone is appointed to be in charge of the ship as we go along. For example, when I go to bed, I will let people know who has the reigns and wish for others to do the same. Lastly, be nice to the EAOS techs!

If you know how far we traveled before stopping during the storm, post it here. We absolutely need to know this when we're going somewhere we can't chart.

All I know is we'd gone about 14.5 when we dropped out the first time. Then a total of probably 3 or 4 more LTC for the other repair stops combined. No idea how far we'd gone when we stopped the first time or this last time. Hope that helps.

It was 18 before the drive break yesterday. I believe you have that one?
We then went 14.5 LTC's when Cartes broke down. It was another 2.2 LTC's when they broke down again.
If there were breakdowns or stops after that, I don't know as I went to bed soon after this second breakdown.

17:04 Enemy reinforcements flood the battlefield, causing allied soldiers to fall back.

17:04 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

17:06 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Y'all awake over there?"

17:09 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "GETTING SHOT AT."

17:09 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "If someone in the other ship is alone, it's good to help with reps. Otherwise, maybe not because someone could end up getting left behind if we aren't extremely careful. It was really almost a thing once."

17:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew pats FCI Scout Keegan Wantz on the back.

17:09 Keegan ducks behind the sofa.

17:11 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Actually it was almost a thing twice but yeah. It could happen."

17:11 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "So, help with reps, or no? I know when I was helping you're reps I triple checked to make sure there was nobody outside when we got back in."

17:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

17:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

17:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "God Johann, what did I just say."

17:12 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

17:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Exactly what I was thinkin."

17:12 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Same, we triple checked and made sure all souls were aboard."

17:12 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

17:12 Ali Candan asks, "Sup?"

17:13 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "If people are alone, help, otherwise don't do it."

17:13 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz chuckles.

17:13 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins at FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

17:13 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

17:13 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I mean...he's got ears..."

17:15 Ali Candan cracks open a can of strawberry milk with a loud pop.

17:15 Ali Candan takes the first sip from a can of strawberry milk.

17:15 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Except for me. I sold my soul for a few tael and a cheeseburger."

17:15 Enemy reinforcements flood the battlefield, causing allied soldiers to fall back.

17:15 A large explosion bursts just outside the trench, raining down dirt and shrapnel.

17:16 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You libertarian."

17:16 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

17:16 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I am just saying if y'all or us have plenty of people repairing, we should be good to go rather than having a dozen people outside. We're getting further out and it'll be good to have someone in a control room watching over the ships and things."

17:16 Ali Candan takes a sip from a can of strawberry milk.

17:17 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Copy."

17:42 The shouts of the enemy soldiers draw ever closer.

17:42 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

17:42 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

17:45 Ali Candan takes a sip from a can of strawberry milk.

17:46 You hear several rattling sounds, followed by a loud bang, as the starship is subjected to ever increasing pressure.

17:46 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

17:47 An underwater current slams into the side of the starship with intense force, shaking the starship violently.

17:47 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

17:49 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stands up.

17:49 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes east.

17:49 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

17:50 You hear several rattling sounds, followed by a loud bang, as the starship is subjected to ever increasing pressure.

17:50 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

17:50 An underwater current slams into the side of the starship with intense force, shaking the starship violently.

17:50 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

17:52 You hear a whistling hiss of steam, like a teapot, emanate from the engine.

17:52 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

17:53 An underwater current slams into the side of the starship with intense force, shaking the starship violently.

18:02 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Want to still drop the sail now that we're out of the storm, nissi?"

18:02 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

18:02 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mel is way ahead of you."

18:02 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

18:02 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh. Nevermind."

18:03 A valve springs a leak, spraying water everywhere!

18:03 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Off for a nap."

18:07 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

18:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

18:12 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

18:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:23 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

18:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

18:33 Through the viewport, a giant unblinking eyeball, the size of a plate, stares into the ship. After losing interest, the hull rocks sharply as the massive squid propels itself away from the starship.

18:33 You faintly hear FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice on the external PA saying, "Howdy Squiddy!"

18:34 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Watch out for the squid."

18:35 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, he'd make a good dinner."

18:36 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Fried calamari, and plenty of ink for making a delicious pasta sauce to go with more sauted squid."

18:43 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

18:43 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

18:54 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

18:54 Ali Candan strides west.

18:55 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

19:07 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

19:07 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

19:13 The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.

19:19 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

19:19 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

19:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stands up.

19:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

19:20 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Going to have to stop for reps."

19:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes south.

19:20 Ali Candan stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

19:20 Ali Candan removes spacesuit components from a black flightbag and quickly dons them.

19:20 Ali Candan strides south.

19:20 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

19:20 FCI Scout Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:20 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Got enough over there to handle it?"

19:20 Ryan Thomas stands up from a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies.

19:20 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We're good, yes."

19:21 FCI Scout Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

19:21 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Copy that."

19:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anybody else?"

19:21 FCI Scout Lily Kaise puts a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

19:21 Ryan Thomas roams south.

19:21 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Give me a moment and i'll be right there."

19:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides south.

19:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

19:22 The smell of rot follows Lindsey, caribou gorn.

19:24 Ryan Thomas roams in from the south.

19:25 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

19:25 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

19:26 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:26 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:26 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

19:26 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

19:26 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

19:27 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

19:27 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

19:45 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

19:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

19:46 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "The attempt at conversation with the other ship has failed."

19:46 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "All is doomed."

19:46 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Doooooomed."

19:46 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

19:46 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Well let's see."

19:47 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Our options are Tobias, Goss, Johann...no, that's it."

19:48 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that checker the world below. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, and a sparkly ouija board here.

19:54 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz chuckles.

19:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

19:54 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Ather doesn't talk unless it's to insult someone, unless he's talking to like.."

19:55 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Me, Pierre, Nissi."

19:55 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

19:55 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "And Aisling I suppose."

19:55 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yeah."

19:56 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

19:56 I see no "lily" here.

20:02 Ryan Thomas stretches.

20:02 Ryan Thomas glances at the display on a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device.

20:03 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Hello Ryan!"

20:03 Ryan Thomas says, "What's happening."

20:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "So I'm curious...because I'm nosy like that..."

20:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

20:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Have either of y'all approached the Timothies?"

20:06 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

20:07 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I've had a few chats with them."

20:07 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Nothing in depth, though."

20:07 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Was kinda surprised they weren't in an org."

20:08 Ryan Thomas says, "Clarina grabbed them. Her and Saralyn are becoming close, I think."

20:08 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

20:08 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

20:08 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:08 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Every time folks get to talkin...he runs..."

20:09 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "He's a bit quiet, usually."

20:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

20:09 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Pretty reliable on the controls, though."

20:09 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I think he's the one who started evasion of the Patrol we ran into, but don't quote me on that."

20:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yep. As evidenced by that overdriven he and Ali did."

20:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

20:10 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Wait what."

20:10 Ryan Thomas says, "Wait, when did we run tinto one."

20:10 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz asks, "They finished one?"

20:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

20:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Corvette. Then the Outsiders got ticked and ramped up their response."

20:10 Ali Candan nods to FCI Scout Morris Corlew.

20:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "We used to do corvette very highs on a regular basis. They were difficult, but not impossible. Now...you can get squires."

20:10 Keegan says to Ryan, "I think you and Clari were passed out, it was super early in my usually waking cycle."

20:10 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I do Destroyer very highs still."

20:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz looks at FCI Scout Morris Corlew thoughtfully.

20:11 Ryan Thomas says, "Yeah like I remember doing very highs in a wing."

20:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Wings in particular, aye."

20:11 Morris says to Keegan, "Those still seem doable from what I've heard."

20:11 Ryan Thomas says, "Heard that's not possible anymore."

20:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I can take out a Squire."

20:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

20:11 Ryan Thomas nods.

20:11 Morris says to Keegan, "In a corvette?"

20:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Two squires and my poor little Wing would explode though."

20:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

20:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Probably? Missile corvette is more firepower than a Wing."

20:11 Ali says to Morris, "I did take out one in a corvette."

20:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I haven't done it. Just heard stories bout folks launchin 'em and runnin."

20:12 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Maybe it's gotten even worse since I last did a very high though."

20:12 Morris says to Keegan, "This is in the last uh."

20:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:12 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I fucked one up in my Marauder and had to bail."

20:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. I can do about half of the ones I launch in my bastille now."

20:12 Ryan Thomas says, "I'd love to do overdriven beacons."

20:12 Ryan Thomas says, "But yeah not ever gonna happen i'm sure."

20:12 Ali says to Ryan, "Don't."

20:12 Ali Candan grins.

20:12 Ryan Thomas grins.

20:12 Ryan Thomas says, "Naw."

20:13 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yeah, please. Your Whip will thank you."

20:13 Ryan Thomas says, "So will my credit assistant."

20:13 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

20:14 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

20:14 Constantine Stone waves.

20:14 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm sad."

20:14 Ali Candan waves.

20:14 Constantine Stone sits down.

20:14 Morris says to Ryan, "How come?"

20:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves to Constantine Stone.

20:14 Ryan Thomas says, "I want to apply for a missile corvette but my combat experience is limited to pirates, accord missions, and beacons."

20:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

20:14 Ryan Thomas says, "So one of the answers would be like uh no extra."

20:14 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "That might be sufficient."

20:14 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz shrugs.

20:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "It might be."

20:14 Ryan Thomas says, "It does ask "other than""

20:14 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Still."

20:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Was for my Avenger and my pincer."

20:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Well."

20:15 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I never got the Prototype Scythe."

20:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Wait...y'all's app includes Merry Band in that?"

20:15 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that checker the world below. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, and a sparkly ouija board here.
Ryan Thomas is standing here. FCI Scout Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug. Ali Candan and FCI Scout Keegan Wantz are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Constantine Stone is seated.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are
20:15  sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

20:15 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Having uhh."

20:15 Ryan Thomas shrugs.

20:15 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Three torps in one room."

20:15 Morris says to Keegan, "Ah. We been wonderin if you had one."

20:15 Ryan Thomas says, "I don't remember. I'd have to look."

20:15 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Sounds painful."

20:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

20:15 Keegan says to Morris, "Nah, that was Cesar's schtick."

20:15 Ali Candan says, "Was good doing beacons in them."

20:15 Ryan Thomas says, "I want a scythe too."

20:15 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I don't know if I'd get accepted if I applied for one at the moment, it's a nice ship but.."

20:15 Morris says to Keegan, "That's what I thought...but we were talkin bout it one day and somebody thought you had one."

20:15 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz asks, "I don't know if I'd ever fly it other than for defense?"

20:15 Ryan Thomas asks, "Why not, Kegan?"

20:16 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Grid."

20:16 Ryan Thomas says, "I'd fly it for beacons and defense. Why not."

20:16 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "While I have a rather large amount of combat piloting experience, I have been remarkably inactive in that department in recent history."

20:16 Keegan says to Ryan, "Because the ship is worth more than a cruiser."

20:16 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "And if you screw up, poof."

20:16 Ryan Thomas nods.

20:16 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz chuckles.

20:16 You say, "Yeah, that would suck."

20:16 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "But then."

20:16 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Ships are meant to be flown."

20:16 Ryan Thomas says, "I just haven't done anything remarkable enough."

20:16 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Otherwise they are pointless."

20:17 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

20:17 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm pretty good at things but i'm kind of a background guy."

20:17 You nod.

20:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:17 Ryan Thomas says, "Like everyone goes to clari for everything."

20:17 Ryan Thomas grins.

20:17 Ryan Thomas says, "And then she makes me do stuff."

20:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew chuckles.

20:17 Morris says to Ryan, "Keep her."

20:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

20:18 Ryan Thomas says, "I like to fly in combat, but it's hard to get experience. Like flying a fringe cruiser high is easy for me. FLying a slowed down morningstar was easy."

20:18 Ryan Thomas says, "But the next scale up is fucking impossible, and I can't get an eaos cruiser."

20:18 Ryan Thomas says, "I know Ather won't ever let me fly his, and I'm not sure who else has one/would, either."

20:18 Ryan Thomas says, "So i'm like, uh, I'll fight a warship in a wasp because I can."

20:19 You ask, "Ather has an EAOs cruiser?"

20:19 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm sorry, I think I gunned in Pierre's."

20:19 Ryan Thomas says, "Not Ather."

20:19 Constantine Stone asks, "Are EAOS cruisers bigger than Fringe cruisers?"

20:19 Ryan Thomas says, "They draw three or four rapids."

20:19 You say, "Oh, ok."

20:19 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."

20:19 Ryan Thomas says, "It was amazing."

20:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yeah. I used to fly the bastille very highs for a challenge. They weren't easy, but...I did a ton of 'em fore I got one that gave me real trouble where I lost the thing. Then the overdriven happened. Now about two out of three are this configuration with like...four warpers. And four warpers and me just...that's my weakness."

20:20 Ryan Thomas says, "My problem is I'll see that it's assault warped."

20:20 Ryan Thomas says, "Literally right after I switched coordinates."

20:20 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "EAOS cruisers are... interesting."

20:20 Ryan Thomas says, "And my ship is slowing down."

20:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

20:20 You nod.

20:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Boost maybe. I dunno...I just get the tar beat outta me with four warpers. Even in a big ship."

20:20 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I have a trick for that that usually helps."

20:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "It's super weird though."

20:21 Ryan Thomas asks, "What's the trick?"

20:21 Morris says to Keegan, "Would love to hear it. Ali's don't work for me."

20:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Basically, if you feel like it's about time for an assault warp to hit."

20:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Fuck shooting anything."

20:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "And kick on autovector."

20:21 Ryan Thomas laughs.

20:21 Ryan Thomas says, "Yeah."

20:21 Ryan Thomas says, "That would do it."

20:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I can't count seconds like that though."

20:21 You chuckle.

20:21 Ryan Thomas nods.

20:21 Ryan Thomas says, "I get so caught up in killing it."

20:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I usually don't manage it."

20:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Especially when they start warpin one at a time."

20:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "But when I do, it feels great."

20:21 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz chuckles.

20:21 You chuckle.

20:21 Ryan Thomas says, "Then I'll get locked on, move to avoid those and see that it's warped and brace and take it like a champ."

20:22 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to Ryan Thomas.

20:22 Ryan Thomas says, "One thing I've noticed though."

20:22 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "That's my general strategy."

20:22 Ryan Thomas says, "They seem to retreat a unit or two from you prior to a warp."

20:22 You say, "That too."

20:22 You say, "Doesn't always happen, but it does."

20:22 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:22 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

20:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "That might give me more of a clue. My strategy has been to follow. Maybe I'll try waitin and watchin."

20:24 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I did learn that if you stay next to 'em...even if they decide to warp...it ain't a big deal. That keeps me from gettin beat on by a single rapid. But if there's more'n one...it just don't work."

20:24 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I've gotten to where I can manage two rapids fairly well...but...even three warpin fighters, I end up gettin beat on."

20:25 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

20:25 Ali Candan strides east.

20:26 Ali Candan strides in from the east.

20:26 Ali Candan says, "I'll be back."

20:26 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Yeah, gotta take them out fast."

20:26 Ali Candan strides south.

20:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

20:26 You nod.

20:26 You say, "Yep, damage boost and be aggressive."

20:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Problem too is I still sometimes...freeze up. That...blasted cruiser high still..."

20:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "It's dumb too. 'Cause I can mostly do cruiser highs no sweat."

20:27 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

20:27 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Consider fixing your brain."

20:27 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins at FCI Scout Keegan Wantz. "Yeah, been workin on that for nearly two years."

20:28 You chuckle.

20:28 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

20:31 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz grins.

20:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

20:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:45 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

20:45 You wrap your arms around FCI Scout Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

20:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles at you.

20:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

20:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves.

20:46 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves. "Yo."

20:52 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz yawns.

20:52 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Hello Lily."

20:53 Lily says to Keegan, "Hey."

20:53 Ryan Thomas says, "Hey."

20:53 FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins. "Hey all of yall."

20:53 You grin.

20:58 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

21:08 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

21:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Gonna take a quick nap, I think."

21:11 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz salutes sharply.
FCI Scout Keegan Wantz scrambles to his feet.
FCI Scout Keegan Wantz strides south.

21:18 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

21:18 You wave to Ali Candan.

21:18 Ali Candan waves.

21:19 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

21:29 You hear someone kicking furiously against the hull.

21:30 Ali Candan strides south.

21:31 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

21:45 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ahoy over there, blackwing. I have just awakened. Does everything go well?"

21:46 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:46 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "That's a deep subject. Don't fall in."

21:46 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Are you still speaking in monkey?"

21:46 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:46 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "If you can understand me...then apparently so."

21:47 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh! Zinger! That was...beautiful."

21:47 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:47 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'll be here all day. And probably tomorrow."

21:56 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

21:58 Constantine Stone stands up.

21:58 Constantine Stone walks south.

22:01 Something tickles the back of your neck.

22:01 FCI Scout Morris Corlew glares at FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

22:07 Ryan Thomas yawns.

22:07 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to Ryan Thomas.

22:07 Ryan Thomas roams south.

22:08 Ryan Thomas roams in from the south.

22:08 Ryan Thomas says, "Ahh."

22:09 Morris says to Ryan, "Hmm?"

22:09 Ryan Thomas says, "Nice way to re-cool a can of punch: set it in the airlock when we go out for repairs. Let the sweet, sweet, coldness of space have at it for a few minutes and then let it sit and warm up."

22:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

22:11 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

22:11 Morris rubs his arms.

22:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stands up.

22:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes east.

22:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

22:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

22:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew shakes a closed can of raspberry iced tea for some reason.

22:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew cracks open a can of raspberry iced tea with a loud pop.

22:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes the first sip from a can of raspberry iced tea.

22:15 The room grows a bit warmer.

22:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip from a can of raspberry iced tea.

22:17 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

22:17 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

22:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves.

22:17 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels waves.

22:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip from a can of raspberry iced tea.

22:17 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Drive break?"

22:17 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels navigates her indigo slider einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

22:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

22:17 Morris says to Melinda, "Went 9.1 when we stopped."

22:18 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods.

22:18 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Did we check course also?"

22:18 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Not sure. Have to ask Nissi."

22:18 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels shrugs.

22:25 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Anyone over there have an idea of our distance travelled overall?"

22:25 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says to Morris, "Wasn't me!"

22:25 Morris says to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz, "Mmhmm."

22:25 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:25 The voice of FCI Scout Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's been two days, so something between 350 and 500 light-years."

22:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:26 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Prior to the last stop, I'd say 54 LTC's."

22:26 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

22:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

22:26 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

22:26 Melinda says to Morris, "What?"

22:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Saw somethin."

22:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew shrugs.

22:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods.

22:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels removes a leather bound journal from a black canvas gear bag.

22:28 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels erases a page in her book and then carefully writes over it.

22:31 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels begins reading in a leather bound journal.

22:32 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels considers a leather bound journal thoughtfully.

22:32 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

22:34 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz asks, "Writing an account of this lovely first contact shenanigans?"

22:34 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "This lovely bit of."

22:34 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Yup, kinda."

22:35 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Neat."

22:36 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz grins.

22:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Math and I aren't friends but I think I got it."

22:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels grins.

22:38 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Guesstimation and I are friends."

22:38 Ryan Thomas says, "Cheers, morris."

22:38 FCI Scout Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:39 Ryan Thomas asks, "We're what, half way there?"

22:39 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Please don't ask me to do triggernometry or none of that complicated mess."

22:39 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Can't estimate ifyou want to return somewhere someday."

22:39 Ryan Thomas says, "Fair enough."

22:40 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I mean you need to not be like 10 LTC's off by the end of the day."

22:40 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Well no."

22:40 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels puts a leather bound journal in a black canvas gear bag.

22:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "But like...you're not gonna have too many issues if you say a subcycle is 10 minutes instead of tryin to math somethin exact. Or a light-year is 3.3 light-grand cycles or whatever."

22:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "No but there is one time I kinda go Akemi like."

22:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "When I am doing trip notes."

22:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels grins.

22:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Well yeah."

22:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

22:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "But triggernometry...nope. Ain't happenin."

22:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:42 Ryan Thomas says, "What do you mean akemi like."

22:42 Morris says to Ryan, "She was -very- exact. On everythin. Mathed anythin she could."

22:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Worse'n Ali."

22:43 Ryan Thomas says, "Huh."

22:43 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I probably am not as bad but, on a trip we ran together, I was more exact than she and she had to fix hers."

22:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew laughs.

22:43 Ryan says to Melinda, "Can I see an example?"

22:43 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm curious."

22:43 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "More correct rather."

22:43 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

22:43 Ryan Thomas says, "And it's not something I'd thought of."

22:44 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Let's find this on the way back and haul a roid home."

22:44 Ryan Thomas asks, "Way out of comms asteroid hauling, anyone?"

22:44 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Trig is actually relatively easy, to be honest."

22:44 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz coughs.

22:44 Melinda says to Ryan, "Just like I'll write 10.2 LTC's instead of 10 LTC's."

22:44 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

22:44 Ryan Thomas nods.

22:44 Ryan Thomas says, "That's fair."

22:44 Ryan Thomas says, "I thought you were like 10.2 LTCs, x lightyears."

22:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "So I am kinda joking but I rather get it close to right than rounding numbers."

22:44 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "That's something I liked about Akemi."

22:44 Melinda says to Ryan, "I do that too."

22:44 Keegan sniffs.

22:44 Ryan Thomas says, "At this amount of time, 34 hours, 33 minutes after takeoff from farport station. At a current heading of x for y hours."

22:44 Morris says to Keegan, "Well...I didn't learn it in school. And a friend try to teach me when I was in flight school...he was goin to college for some kinda math somethin and he gave up after bout two weeks of me starin at him."

22:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I give the light-years and LTC's."

22:45 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, and a sparkly ouija board here.

(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

22:45 Ryan Thomas asks, "So how many light years per LTC?"

22:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "7.74."

22:45 Ryan Thomas nods.

22:45 Ryan Thomas says, "I recall that."

22:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Some people are lazy and do 7.7."

22:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew blinks.

22:45 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Others are lazier and do 8."

22:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

22:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew laughs.

22:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Wow."

22:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I do 7.74."

22:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "You'd be off by so far if you did that."

22:46 Ryan Thomas says, "So 32 light years this go."

22:46 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "To be honest."

22:46 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Drift usually makes the error not matter."

22:46 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "A general idea of where you are is usually all you really have."

22:46 "To an extent." FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz. "Which is why 2.2 and not 2.21."

22:46 Melinda says to Ryan, "But my log really isn't that crazy."

22:46 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels removes a leather bound journal from a black canvas gear bag.

22:47 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "This one is lazy."

22:47 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels puts down a leather bound journal.

22:47 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "My first expedition log wasn't lazy."

22:47 Ryan Thomas gives a can of fruit punch to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

22:47 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels points at a leather bound journal.

22:47 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins reading in a leather bound journal.

22:47 Ryan Thomas begins reading in a leather bound journal.

22:47 Ryan Thomas asks, "May I keep reading?"

22:48 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Oh. We landed at Farport?"

22:48 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods to FCI Scout Morris Corlew.

22:48 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods to Ryan Thomas. "There is just two pages so go ahead."

22:48 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I'll finalize today's page at midnight."

22:48 Ryan Thomas says, "Damn."

22:48 Ryan Thomas says, "So we could get there tomorrow."

22:48 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Sad I missed Horrible People with our First Contact Initiative TEAM leader."

22:48 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "24% on the NDB, we're like 750 from the Torus. Short range was Helios, but I don't actually remember what the percentage was in relation to the Torus one."

22:49 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

22:49 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

22:49 Ryan Thomas asks, "Because I'm sure we've gone a hundred or two today. Just over 30 since repairs. So I'd guess, what, actually 90 tops?"

22:49 Morris says to Keegan, "We were at 1% on the Helios when Torus was 41%."
