-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, an
insulated purple sleeping bag, and Shule Elemmire's workbench here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're
approaching that first performance goal! Our penultimate victory is just ahead!
Let's go, people! Go go go! Wow, you'd think all this cheerleading would be
annoying, but it's not!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ok I think I like the
fringe suit better, at least for low deployment missions. I just killed my first
drone when I had no such luck with the one for AEU."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't suppose I
could rope any of you into doing a nest?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I can come after
finishing this mission."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Same here Jade. The
Fringe suit has much more of a punch."
tra 1 Sure. I could do a nest.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Sure. I could do a nest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Is it a tier 5 nest?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The suits will
be bottom-tier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But the action
will be nothing but top-tier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I'm definitely not
tier 5, only 1."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That is lame."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Oh neat, I got an
energy bottle from one of these drones."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just<n, can -ou
]o a ne>t?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Gotta bug out shortly,
next time."
[Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One for a nest?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "If you guys get
enough people before I'm done, go ahead. I'm not sure how long this will take.
There's a lot of rooms here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like we
won't get anyone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Take your time,
at any rate."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "This little pistol
isn't half bad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How big is the
hold of the heavy transport?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "So are we nesting? Or
have we not found enough people still."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We never got
enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I'll just keep
practicing then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What kind of
suit do you have?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Fringe now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I was on AEU, but I
had to refurbish the last time I went in a low deployment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting.
What do you do about damage in the fringe suit? Are the repair drones you find
enough to keep it going?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I find those, plus I
think the suit itself has a bit of regen on it. It repairs itself slowly over
time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, suits do
fix themselves over time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It can just take
a while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Well, so far the
pistol has done way better than that laser on the AEU suits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Agreed. I'm cleaning up
down here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, fringe
suits are much better for doing damage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Going on my second
mission, it's quite profitable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I never tried a
low deployment in anything but an AEU suit, though. It's good to know you don't
really need to repair."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "How did you survive
that? Did you just run to the tower and hope you didn't get blown up before
destroying it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, just regen
myself, shoot at a thing till it dies, repair myself up, repeat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "That probably took
ages."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Am I correct in
assuming that for the low mission the primary goal is to destroy the drone
control tower?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "That's what happened
when I did the last one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think
they took any longer than doing SVP pods, but it's been quite a while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah the goal is
to destroy the tower."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Never done those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if you're
doing low deployments without repairing I assume you can probably do SVP pods
without it, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I like killing the
drones and finding the stuff for my suit though. It's nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe the armor
makes a huge different and you just don't take much damage."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "That could be it. I
didn't get light armor when I used it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "But I did for this
one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I never
used armor on my AEU suit either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would
typically end a fight around 40% damaged."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And have to
repair three times."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rental is
probably a good balance, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you can get
someone to fly you out to Helios."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You know when
you're doing a tesla site, the leader will try to use his laser or whatever."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And people will
try to stun."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

normal battle suit for that?"

need to pony up a fee."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval

cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

julius?"

hauling? It's so much better than salvaging I think."

some may not yet..."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Are
you all doing the missions from Space Vermin Patrol? There is a variety to do
there. Asteroid haulers and other ships are not available to you until you have
become a fully licensed Pilot."

and check that out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I did one of the pod
missions earlier. It was fun killing those rats minor things."

yes, and also visited tesla world a lot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I think I have enough
money for teslaworld now, if it's not more than 20 mill."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

you can get a loan."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Hm, I might just do a
few more missions for money, being in debt doesn't sit well with me."

courier runs myself, but it's not as good when you're starting out."

get paid once a week."

option."

at midnight tonight."

salvage my way, and do missions and some mining, waiting for better times."

room for improvement there. Are you able to do beacons solo if you set the
strength low enough?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "Should be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think a very
low is a one-on-one fight."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Was
merely pointing out a number of types of work and if you pace yourself and not
do just one type of work all of the time, you won't become too bored with your
work and a paycheck once per week form one type of work isn't a bad thing. Also,
courier helps you learn about other places and you can explore those while you
are out couriering which breaks up the monotony."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It might still
be tough in a fighter that you can field currently, though. If you're going to
do that, think about renting a fighter from tannhauser."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah, interesting.
Those are fun."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Julius Smith transmits, "I saw a nest today,
didn't do anything about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You typically
need a crew of 4 for a nest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Will do. I've been
hesitant to get a fighter now anyway since I can't really get upgrades yet."

a ship."

roomy one, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Ah yes, the good old
days. At least I don't have to sleep under those admitedly very clean
plastisteel bridges on the main concourse."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Well if it has living
quarters with a bed, it's better than this one roomed space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Triggs transmits, "Yeah, so do I.
It's not a bad place to sleep, either."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup
I still sleep in a shp 99 percent of the time as well. You can buy sleeping bags
over on Mars and you can always put a bed in the store room which is where I
slept until I qualified for a gunship which has living quarters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want a place
on New Earth, but I don't like living underground."
