-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

05:27 You say, "I know it's not much..."

05:27 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "And he threw snowballs at the boys that followed me in to the bar, and my friend girl, but then I could be reading too much in to that."

05:28 You say, "Just take it one day at a time."

05:28 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It's been 4 months Shule."

05:28 You say, "I know."

05:32 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Freak out a bit and bild up a wall."

05:32 You say, "Awww, it's just the way you handle this kind of thing. Nothing wrong with it."

05:33 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I've figured out that."

05:34 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I can't be happy when it comes to dating unless I like the guy back. But every time I go on a date with someone all I think bout is Ather, and after the date and stuff I feel more empty and sad inside."

05:34 You say, "Awww, I know the feeling."

05:34 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "So I don't think it will work unless I like the guy back, but how can I when I'm still in loe with Ather."

05:35 You say, "Yeah, that's a good question."

05:36 You say, "And I'm not sure there's an easy answer."

05:36 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I feel like if he dated someone, or if I found out he was dating someone..."

05:36 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I could have a reason to turn away."

05:36 You say, "Maybe, or it could just make you jealous."

05:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I don't think it would."

05:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I think it would really hurt, but it would force me to turn away."

05:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Because I would've lost all hope."

05:37 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "As harsh as that senario sounds."

05:38 You say, "No, I understand."

05:38 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "How?"

05:38 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Or maybe if he turned gay, that might help."

05:38 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Or bi."

05:38 Over the line, Katina Faye giggles.

05:38 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

05:38 You chuckle.

05:38 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Then I couldn't take him seriously."

05:39 You say, "Yeahm, maybe."

05:39 You say, "I don't know. If it were me and Lily... I'd never stop loving Lily."

05:39 You say, "Even if I found out she was dating someone else."

05:39 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I could've gotten drunk let loose and been a naughty girl tonight."

05:39 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "But even if Ather wasn't there, I wouldn't and wasn't."

05:40 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "All because my stupid heart wants to be preserved for him, though we'll never be together."

05:40 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins wiggles his hairy palps endearingly.

05:41 You say, "Oh, I don't think you being naughty tonight would have necessarily meant you weren't being preserved for him."

05:41 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Yes of course I'd still love Ather even if he was dating someone else, but..."

05:41 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I don't know how to explain it."

05:42 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Plese don't tell anyone of what you overheard tonight."

05:43 You say, "Of course not."

05:43 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It's really personal."

05:43 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Sorry was talking to someone else."

05:43 You say, "I know. I won't share it with anyone. I'm hardly around enough to talk to people and nobody talks to me anyways."

05:43 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I talk to you. Mister."

05:44 You say, "True. I meant except you and Lily."

05:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Okay hmm let me try."

05:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "If he was dating someone else."

05:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "I'd still love him."

05:44 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "But."

05:45 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye ask, "I feel like I'd have no right to keep hoping for anything, so that fact would sort of...force me to turn away from him?"

05:46 You say, "I understand."

05:46 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Ather hardly iniciates any interest in me unless I iniciate first, so I feel so pathetic."

05:46 You say, "Awww."

05:47 You say, "You most certainly are not."

05:48 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "So if he still has feelings for me, maybe he would've or could've done something about it...but maybe he did. I haven't seen him in a while. So maybe him coming here tonight was him hoping to see me. Because he threw snowballs at me and blah blah blah. Or maybe I could be reading in to it and jut being a hopeless idiot."

05:48 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Because how could he come here hoping to see me, knowing that I am shy, and most likely would not have come."

05:49 You say, "That's tough to tell either way. And yeah, I see your point. Unfortunately, I need to cut this conversation short. I should go to sleep."

05:49 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "It's fine."

05:49 Over the line, you hear Katina Faye say, "Happy dreams Shule."

05:50 You say, "Thanks. You too when the time comes."

05:50 The connection goes silent with a soft click.

05:50 You place a metallic gold touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

05:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

05:50 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.)

05:50 I don't understand that.
