[Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One]
This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. The paint seems rather worn here, as though Dock One tends to be preferred despite being identical to the other three. A ramp leads up to the rest of the station.
The one-person marauder "Burn, Don't Freeze", the one-person fighter "Gambit", the one-person cargo hauler "Current Mood", the three-person light quantum patroller "The Haggis Boson", the four-person Accord space module transport "RUNE Module Hauler", the two-person Accord space module scout "We'll Get There", the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lake", the two-person Accord gemini "Haunted Reveries", the one-person cargo hauler "Jordan", and the two-person tugboat "Chemeketa" are landed here.

She has average-sized shoulders and average-sized breasts. Her face is average-shaped, lightly-freckled, and fairly pretty, with an average nose and strong chin. Her lips are soft and brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes are blue and average-shaped. Her shoulder-length, straight hair is light brown and neatly combed. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a standard grey shipsuit and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a dusty metachannel FTL communicator, and a small cloth sack. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a charge booster in her right hand.

02:05 You ask, "Here, can you take me aboard?"

02:05 Charisma Smith says, "Yes."

02:05 Charisma Smith says, "How."

02:06 You say, OOCly, "Just hold me and walk aboard."

02:06 Charisma Smith holds your hand, taking you into her group.

You find manipulating the hatch slightly more difficult in a weightless environment.
(1 seconds roundtime.)

02:06 You cannot power up the ship until main power is restored.

02:06 The sensor systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

02:06 You can't go that way.

02:06 You unlatch a panel and slide it aside, revealing a mass of wires.  You shove the wires out of the way, and find a set of circuit breaker switches.

02:07 [Starship "Jordan"; Control Room]

02:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. The room is just large enough to accommodate a pilot's seat and the controls before it. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.
You see a plastic emergency bubble here.
Charisma Smith is standing here.
You can go down and out.
You are weightless here.

02:07 You say, "Hang on. I'm going to tug your ship back to new earth."

02:07 You ask, "Ok?"

02:08 Charisma Smith

02:08 She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has light brown skin. Her body is athletic with curved hips and average calves. She has average-sized shoulders and average-sized breasts. Her face is average-shaped, lightly-freckled, and fairly pretty, with an average nose and strong chin. Her lips are soft and brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes are blue and average-shaped. Her shoulder-length, straight hair is light brown and neatly combed. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a standard grey shipsuit and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a dusty metachannel FTL communicator, and a small cloth sack. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a charge booster in her right hand.

02:08 You ask, "Actually, give me the chargge booster first?"

02:08 Charisma Smith says, "No luck."

02:08 You nod.

02:08 You ask, "Can I see the charge booster?"

02:08 You smile.

02:09 Charisma Smith gives you a charge booster.

02:09 You lift a panel and insert a charge booster, then discharge it into the ship's batteries.

02:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.
You suddenly fall to the deck as artificial gravity is abruptly restored.

02:09 You say, "There you go."

02:09 You smile.

02:09 Charisma Smith says, "Thanks."

02:09 You say, "You just needed to use it."

02:09 You say, "Hang on."

02:09 Charisma Smith says, "Oh ok."

02:09  __  
|  | Charge Readout:
|  | 
|  | 33 minutes and 25 seconds of charge remaining at the current rate of discharge.

02:10 This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. The paint seems rather worn here, as though Dock One tends to be preferred despite being identical to the other three. A ramp leads up to the rest of the station.

16:32 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

However, what if the Outsiders did see the vulnerabilities there and decided to exploit them. Here we are on The Torus with a pretty good fleet of combat ships. If we're the only one's still standing... so to speak, then I think you can see what may be the outcome of the current predicament of those of us who have lost our flying privilege."

19:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident turns a high tech silver star print holovid on.

19:04 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of a generic-looking planet spinning around. "And now the Interstellar Politics Hour, special League Election Edition!"

19:04 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades quickly, then displays a newscaster seated at a desk.

19:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have to see this one sorry."

19:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

19:04 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Good evening. Today we look at the final results of the League general election."

19:04 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

19:05 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster stands up and moves over to one wall, which displays a hologram of five planets and five land masses.

19:05 You say, "It's all ggood."

19:05 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Five worlds and the five zones of Old Earth. Yesterday the citizens of the League of Old Earth Democracies used their democratic right to vote to choose who will lead us for the next five years."

19:06 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Liberals have managed to keep their eighteen seats, while the Conservatives lost five, leaving them with seventeen."

19:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Wow talk about facitons!"

19:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Factions."

19:06 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster gestures at the gold and blue segments as he speaks.

19:06 You nod.

19:06 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Republicans are not far behind with ten seats, and the Callistan Independence Movement gains its largest victory with six."

19:06 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Motioning towards the brown and white segments, the newscaster pauses for a moment before continuing.

19:06 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Democratic Socialists have lost several seats to leave them with five, thanks to the Independence Movement's efforts, while League Reform have gained their first three seats on Callisto. One seat was won by the independent Daniel Koverian, who takes it from the Conservatives.

19:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: As he speaks, the newscaster gestures at the red, purple, and grey sections.

19:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster motions as if to fling the planet away, and it moves aside to be replaced with a hologram of Vesta.

19:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Vesta is next, with one hundred and twenty seats total."

19:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: As with Callisto, Vesta is suddenly divided into multiple segments.

19:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Conservatives have held on to their seats here and even gaining three more, giving them fifty two in total."

19:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A large segment of the hologram lights up blue.

19:07 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Meanwhile the Liberals have lost significant ground as the Democratic Socialists take half their seats, with each party now holding twenty."

19:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Two equally sized segments light up, one gold and the other red.

19:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Vesta is not known for its love of the Republicans, but they still manage to keep hold of nine seats, while League Reform gains five seats from them."

19:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh I'm sure this isn't making morris happy."

19:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Thin slivers of the hologram turn brown and purple as the parties are named.

19:08 You say, "Probably not."

19:08 A long chartreuse soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

19:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Subaquatic Survival loses a seat to the Land and Sky Movement, giving them six and four seats respectively."

19:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Two different sections become white.

19:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Meanwhile three independents take seats from the Liberals, with the Greens taking one for themselves."

19:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Haha what sub-aquatic? Do they all leave on submarines?"

19:08 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Once again he pushes the hologram of the planet aside as it is replaced with Centauri.

19:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Live."

19:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Of the one hundred and seventy two seats in Centauri, the Conservatives have had significant losses but still hold sixty eight."

19:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Centauri splits into sections, with a large chunk becoming blue.

19:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Liberals keep their thirty, while the Democratic Socialists lose a few to end up with twenty two."

19:09 You say, "Nah, I think it's an underwater colony. Or something."

19:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Two sections become gold and red.

19:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Yes to the Accord gains strength with its fifteen seats, while the Republicans snatch up some old Conservative constituencies to give them eleven."

19:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know, I was being a bit sarcastic."

19:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: One section becomes yellow, while another becomes brown.

19:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

19:09 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "League Reform does almost as well as the Republicans, managing to get ten seats for themselves."

19:10 You turn on the silent running feature.

19:10 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A section becomes purple.

19:10 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A hologram of Luna replaces Centauri.

19:10 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Once again a strong showing from the Conservatives with ninety four seats of Luna's two hundred."

19:10 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The hologram of Luna splits, with the largest portion becoming blue.

19:10 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Democratic Socialists overtake the Liberals for the first time on Luna with twenty four seats to the Liberal twenty three."

19:11 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A section glows white.

19:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh darn I was going to help you out with undocking your platforms. Oh well guess since nothing is going anywhere, they're fine."

19:11 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "League Reform takes fourteen seats, while Yes to the Accord takes ten."

19:11 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Two smaller sections become purple and yellow.

19:11 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Republicans have a poor showing, losing multiple seats to leave themselves with only five, while the Greens gain a seat to give themselves seven."

19:11 You say, "Yeah, sorry."

19:11 You say, "Don't worry about it for now."

19:11 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Sections of the hologram glow brown and green.

19:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I can't heh."

19:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

19:12 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Democratic Socialists move in to Conservative territory to hold thirty six seats, while the Liberals take twenty two and the Republicans manage twenty."

19:12 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Yes to the Accord and League Reform both win ten seats each, while the Greens take six and the last two go to independents."

19:13 From a high tech silver star print holovid: As sections light up yellow, purple, green, and grey, the newscaster moves the Mars hologram to the side.

19:13 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Now we move to the Old Earth zones. But so far while the Conservatives have held on to their core seats elsewhere, will it be enough to gain an overall victory?"

19:13 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster takes a few steps as a map of Africa appears on the other side of him.

19:13 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Sixty of Africa's ninety seats go to the Conservatives, fifteen to the Liberals, eight to Terra First, five to Sustainable Earth, and two to independent candidates."

19:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow."

19:13 I don't understand that.

19:13 From a high tech silver star print holovid: He gently nudges the hologram of Africa out of frame, and a holographic map of Oceania appears.

19:13 You nod.

19:14 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "For Oceania, the Conservatives take fifty two of its ninety seats, Liberals take eighteen, the Republicans and One Alliance both take five seats each, Yes to the Accord and Earth for Earthers both take four, with two independents also winning seats."

19:14 From a high tech silver star print holovid: Oceania gets pushed away as a hologram of the Sinozone appears.

19:14 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "For the Sinozone's one hundred and twenty seats, the Conservatives take sixty nine, the Liberals thirty one, People's Hope manage to get ten, Earth for Earthers get seven, and the last three all go to independents."

19:14 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The hologram of the Sinozone is replaced with one of the Amerzone.

19:14 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "The Conservatives hold forty two of the Amerzone's ninety. The Republicans take fifteen, the Liberals thirteen, Terra First get ten, Greens manage to get eight, and the remaining two are once again taken by independents.

19:15 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster once again moves the hologram aside to reveal one of the Eurozone.

19:15 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "And finally, the capital area, the Eurozone. Sixty eight of the Eurozone's one hundred and ten seats go to the Conservatives, twenty two to the Liberals, twelve to Earth for Earthers, five to Yes to the Accord, two to independents and... surprisingly, the Monster Raving Loony Party gain their first seat ever."

19:15 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "We also know that the special civilian pilot area, technically classed as part of the Eurozone, is now a Yes to the Accord held seat."

19:15 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newscaster swipes the Eurozone hologram aside.

19:16 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "That's a lot of numbers, but what does it actually mean?"

19:16 From a high tech silver star print holovid: He moves back to his desk and sits down.  Behind him, a list of the parties and their seats appears.

19:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow wo they all were Yess to the Accord."

19:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Makes sense though."

19:16 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Of the minor parties, the big winners are Mars Life with sixy seats, Yes to the Accord with forty four seats, and League Reform with forty two seats. But with all thirteen hundred seats of the League Assembly now accounted for, we know that none of the big four have an absolute majority.  So what now, does this mean there is no government?"

19:16 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

19:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Whoah."

19:16 From a high tech silver star print holovid: A picture of Old Earth with a red X over it is displayed.

19:17 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "For now, no government can form. What will happen over the next week or so will depend on the ministers and their party leaders. For parliament to reconvene a coalition must be formed that has an overall majority in the Assembly. What kind of coalition is likely? We'll have to wait and see."

19:17 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "That's all we have for today. This has been the Interstellar Politics Hour, only on ISNN!"

19:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Talk about fragmentation and the possibility of major disorganization."

19:17 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays as the camera slowly zooms away from the newscaster, who nods politely before tidying up his papers.

19:17 You nod.

19:17 You say, "Definitely."

19:17 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a moment.

19:17 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "So, it looks like, who will the Conservatives form a coalition with?"

19:17 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of a generic-looking planet spinning around. "And now, the Interstellar Politics Hour, extended edition!"

19:18 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades quickly, then displays a newscaster seated at a desk.

19:18 From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Good evening.  As the League election campaigns continue, we speak with the candidates or their party representatives to hear their policies in their own words."

19:18 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Will they all form against the conservatives."

19:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Yeah Ted makes a point unless they have another runoff election?"

19:18 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The faces of several people appear behind the reporter, including someone who appears to be wearing an elongated bucket.

19:18 You say, "Yeah."

19:18 From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of the first face expands to replace all of the others, revealing a middle aged woman with greying brown hair.  Text under her reads 'Amber Weaver - Leader of the Conservatives'.

19:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident turns a high tech silver star print holovid off.

19:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Can you see them all being able to agree on things enough to do that?"

19:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok that was enough."

19:18 You grin.

19:18 I don't understand that.

19:19 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

19:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

19:19 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Much more likely the conservatives will get a party or two to agree with them."

19:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Nope."

19:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It will be intereesting to see."

19:19 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Is ENN a tabloid and I was unaware?"

19:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "No, they won one seat, their first ever, so they are celebrating."

19:20 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Oh. Well good for them. They got ambition."

19:21 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Go for Accord, Conservatiiiiiives."

19:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I can't hold all the numbers in my head, but it probably only needs one party to go in with the Conservatives, I'd hazard one of Liberals, Republicans, Yes to Accord or somebody."

19:24 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.
