-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
00:31 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go out.

00:36 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

00:36 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:36 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:36 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

00:36 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

00:36 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:36 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon A-23. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Spinward Cluster."

00:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:36 Streams of stellar gases and glittering clusters of debris unfurl in every direction in nearby space.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:36 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon A-23."

00:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:36 The computer reports that the ares "Warship 865" has performed an emergency jump with heavy wormhole drive damage.

00:36 Via general sector communication, Beacon A-23 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Deadly Strike.' Welcome to Beacon A-23."

00:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And it umped."

00:37 The computer reports that the three-person Accord destroyer "Peacekeeper Escort Division Rho 6" has jumped out of the sector.

00:37 The computer reports that the two-person Accord corvette "Peacekeeper Task Force Zeta 8" has jumped out of the sector.

00:37 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:37 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

00:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Huh?"

00:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It jumped out."

00:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise laughs.

00:37 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

00:37 
AEU transport "Money Maker" departed to AEU sector Providence Gate (Alpha-1) approximately 2 minutes ago.

00:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

00:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well i'm sure the peacekeepers appreciate your chasing it away."

00:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:38 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:38 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

00:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Anyways, hi Lily."

00:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:39 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "There I managed two salvage missions prior to the end of conquest."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
08:55 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
