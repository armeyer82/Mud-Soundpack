-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

22:52 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and Shule Elemmire's workbench here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:52 You blink heavily and then doze off.

23:46 You pick up Shule Elemmire's workbench.

23:46 You put Shule Elemmire's workbench in a leather briefcase.

23:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:46 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:46 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:46 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:46 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

23:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:46 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:46 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

23:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:46 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

23:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:47 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

23:47 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

23:47 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

23:47 --

23:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey shule."

23:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:47 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:48 You scramble to your feet.

23:48 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:48 You exit the ship.
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", the three-person clipper "Obliteration", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

23:48 You peer south...

23:48 
[Old Frontier Processor; Asteroid Mining]
This room appears to be a control center from which one can control drone operations at remote mining sites. There appear to be several dents in the wall.
You see a large leather couch, a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt, and a small natural golden brown trash bin here.
You can go north.

23:48 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

You can go south and out.

23:48 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident.

23:48 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:48 Not ejected.

23:48 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:48 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior pulsates gently.

23:54 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

23:55 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

23:56 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.
