00:19:45 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:19:45 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked. A small light near the hatch is dark and unpowered.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:19:46 You can't go that way.

00:19:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:19:48 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:19:57 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

00:19:58 I don't understand that.

00:20:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:20:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)

00:22:55 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:23:11 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hmm?"

00:23:46 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli. What the fuck am I gonna do with 20 cans of indigo gelatin?"

00:23:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

00:24:07 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Make a gellatin spider."

00:24:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oo."

00:24:28 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Fill up an aquarium and scare hell out of your fish."

00:24:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:24:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Tell the felo it's a new fashion statement."

00:24:51 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos". The organization has earned 99,925.56 credits.

00:25:11 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Get a picture of johann naked and asleep and drooling coveredin gellatin except for key portions."

00:25:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Uh."

00:25:36 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Start the first gellatin wrestling matches on the residential structure."

00:25:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Damn it, shut up woman!"

00:25:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:25:57 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hey, you asked what you do with it, I never garuanteed that it would be good suggestions."

00:26:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh, I know, dip fish eggs in it."

00:26:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Allied Pirates? Huh."

00:26:58 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Nah, she doesn't have enough jeliton."

00:27:28 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "She probably doesn't, with all those eggs."

00:27:47 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Make a gellatin bomb and drop it on someone..."

00:28:00 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I'd send it back to him is what I'd do."

00:28:09 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's boring though."

00:28:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey, I don't have that many eggs..."

00:28:19 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Make a gellatin bomb and cover him in it."

00:28:34 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You have enough to need color-coated storage containers to keep track of them all."

00:28:37 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You have hundreds of them, at least."

00:28:47 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "And get more every day."

00:28:57 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Mmmmm caviar."

00:29:04 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In indigo gellatin."

00:29:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. Okay so...maybe I have done the color-coded storage containers. but there might only be 10 in each. for all you lot know."

00:29:54 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I doubt it."

00:29:59 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Reminds me of the time that dumb fuck Lillian sent me a dozen sets of kitchen knives. Should've used them on her."

00:30:07 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "But they probably would've broken."

00:30:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where at?"

00:30:24 [General Communication] Johann Schraft chuckles.

00:31:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Be careful around them. If you bring up your 'shipclass' display you can see what kind of ship it is."

00:31:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But none of you can deny that I'm super generous with eggs. I'll just give them to people. Well...other than my butterflies. snappers. and grabbers."

00:31:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If it's just a transport, they probably won't bother you."

00:31:37 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Well what else is there to do with them?"

00:31:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I didnt check, but they were flying towards me, so I didnt stick around, as I was in my hauler. Im about to go back and check in my fighter. The Belt of Orion."

00:31:53 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hey, I am more than happy to give away my light blue and light purple eggs."

00:32:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I could make people pay for them. I could refuse to share. I could hoard them all..."

00:32:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, let us know if more jump in or if they start shooting."

00:32:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well since i"m technically sterilized, I could sell my eggs for increased wit and wisdom."

00:32:43 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:32:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:32:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:32:49 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

00:32:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:32:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:32:59 The ship is already moving.

00:33:00 The ship is already moving.

00:33:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:33:02 Which sector did you mean?

00:33:02 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

00:33:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:33:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:33:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

00:33:07 You're already sitting.

00:33:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:33:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I mean...Damn right. you're gonna pay for a dark gray or a white, other than that...fuck it. I don't need the credits."

00:33:08 The computer reports that the one-person fighter "Trinaos" has jumped out of the sector.

00:33:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:33:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:33:10 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: D$&<,uE(*K4l~6UvRtrwTW8`D@.GGQ6>~#wrer_w
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

00:33:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:33:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:33:15 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:33:16 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

00:33:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:33:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:33:21 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:33:21 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

00:36:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:36:41 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:36:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's possible to fight it with a fighter."

00:36:46 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:36:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:36:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:37:01 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

00:37:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But with your upgraes, a hit from it would have done quite a bit of damage."

00:37:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:54:20 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Nests?"

00:54:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Does it mean the capital ship drydock when it says drydock on it?.. I went there but it looked pretty damaged."

00:54:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It does mean that, yeah. You'll need a space suit to get around."

00:54:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And watch your step in there."

00:55:16 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would do a nest."

01:40:42 You flip a phone-based holoemitter to PACC.

01:40:43 From a phone-based holoemitter: A floating Public Access logo appears next to the words "Public Access HV."

01:41:12 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Robutt."

01:41:20 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What do you want from my stupid life."

01:41:32 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Nothing."

01:41:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't you know I'm suffering enough already."

01:41:40 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Just making observation."

01:41:41 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh good. Begone."

01:42:10 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I would rather annoy you. More fun."

01:42:32 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah."

01:42:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Can't seem to find the place at the drydock."

01:42:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Keep looking!"

01:42:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Aww, you're gonna miss my broadcast Tara."

01:43:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:43:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:43:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:43:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's fine though. Cadets probably shouldn't get mixed up in this stuff anyways."

01:43:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't get carried awya, Eli. She has 17 minutes."

01:43:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:43:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:43:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:43:30 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Capital Ship Drydock. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:43:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:43:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

01:43:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:43:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:43:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:43:38 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:43:38 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Shipyards."

01:43:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Seventeen? I gotta stand here being nervous for seventeen minutes?"

01:43:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:43:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:43:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:43:43 The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and darkened, and the ISC is no more.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:43:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Capital Ship Drydock."

01:43:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:43:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:43:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:43:48 A large frame hangs in space here, sufficiently large to at least contain a battlecruiser-class starship.

01:43:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "About 16 now, but yes."

01:43:49 AutoStar detects 1 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:43:50 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Shipyard Structure.

01:43:50 Via general sector communication, Shipyard Structure transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to Capital Ship Drydock."

01:43:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:43:54 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I could take you back to Caitlynn. Would that not be fun?"

01:44:05 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fun for who?"

01:44:06 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "You two would get along splendidly."

01:44:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Do some stretches, relax a little. It helps."

01:44:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:44:12 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:44:17 The computer receives no response, and begins docking procedures.

01:44:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:44:20 You stand up from a black leather captain's chair.

01:44:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

01:44:22 You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:44:22 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "And by get along I mean duel to the death."

01:44:23 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'd rather go back to see Sybil."

01:44:24 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

01:44:24 [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:44:24 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

01:44:26 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

01:44:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:44:28 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

01:44:30 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

01:44:34 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

01:44:35 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

01:44:36 You exit the ship.

01:44:36 [Shipyard Structure; Docking Bay]
The exploration vessel "Percival Lowell", the one-person cargo hauler "Nation", the one-person cargo hauler "Supernova20", the one-person fighter "Trinaos", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north.
You are weightless here.

01:44:40 You can't go that way.

01:44:42 [Shipyard Structure; Forward Frame Assembly]

01:44:42 You can go northeast, south, northwest, and down.
You are weightless here.

01:44:44 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That is pretty much wha tit would ultimately end up being, yep."

01:44:48 [Shipyard Structure; Port Frame Assembly]

01:44:49 You see a spacesuited figure here.
You can go southwest and northwest.
You are weightless here.

01:44:51 [Shipyard Structure; Aft Frame Assembly]

01:44:51 You can go southeast and southwest.
You are weightless here.

01:44:53 Tara Flores awkwardly floats in from the southwest.

01:44:57 You smile at Tara Flores.

01:45:00 You exclaim, "Hi!"

01:45:06 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

01:45:06 Tara Flores exclaims, "Oh, Hey!"

01:45:12 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "She would win, you know."

01:45:14 You ask, "What are you looking for?"

01:45:24 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "She might."

01:45:28 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But I wouldn't make it easy."

01:45:28 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:
Tara Flores says, "The place I can upgrade my ship at."

01:45:30 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "She was certainly a formiddable woman."

01:45:31 Tara Flores chuckles.

01:45:47 [Shipyard Structure; Aft Frame Assembly]

01:45:47 The massive structure of the aft frame assembly is gone - there is no debris, no frame, nothing.  There does not seem to be much visible damage to the girders, beams and plating that you can see, but the rest of the assembly is just no longer there. The damage to the deck has bent into a rather unnatural ramp leading downward to the underside of the aft frame assembly. There is also a large hole in the station's skin here. And finally, a curious trail of floating breadcrumbs leads to a gaping hatch.
Tara Flores is standing here.
You can go southeast and southwest.
You are weightless here.

01:45:48 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Let it be known Ather is not easy."

01:45:56 [Shipyard Structure; Sandwich Research]

01:45:56 You can go out.

01:45:58 [Shipyard Structure; Aft Frame Assembly]

01:45:59 Tara Flores is standing here.
You can go southeast and southwest.
You are weightless here.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

01:46:01 You grin.

01:46:12 Shule gestures to the bread crumbs and the hatch.

01:46:16 Tara Flores just went into a hatch.

01:46:20 [Shipyard Structure; Sandwich Research]

01:46:20 Tara Flores is standing here.
You can go out.

01:46:23 You cheer for Tara Flores!

01:46:25 You grin.

01:46:57 Your suit radio crackles briefly, then:

01:46:57 Tara Flores says, "Wow, im suprised I missed that."

01:47:06 You say, "It's ok."

01:47:08 You grin.

01:47:24 Tara Flores opens a sturdy dark green canvas backpack.

01:47:29 Tara Flores removes a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" from a sturdy dark green canvas backpack.

01:47:32 Tara Flores opens a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

01:47:36 Tara Flores begins reading in a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades".

01:47:40 You wave to Tara Flores.

01:47:42 Tara Flores waves.

01:47:44 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Ather, do you have a Spinward chart?"

01:47:47 [Shipyard Structure; Aft Frame Assembly]

01:47:47 You can go southeast and southwest.
You are weightless here.

01:47:50 [Shipyard Structure; Port Frame Assembly]

01:47:50 You see a spacesuited figure here.
You can go southwest and northwest.
You are weightless here.

01:47:51 The exploration vessel "Percival Lowell", the one-person cargo hauler "Nation", the one-person cargo hauler "Supernova20", the one-person fighter "Trinaos", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north.
You are weightless here.

01:47:53 [Shipyard Structure; Docking Bay]

01:47:53 Once the docking bay of the shipyards, this area is now a platform open to space.  Broken beams of metal float almost serently about the platform, many of them several hundred meters in length.  A large number of badly-welded plates to the north seem to have been an attempt to keep atmosphere to the rest of the structure, but the multitude of tears and holes indicate that it was unsuccessful.
The exploration vessel "Percival Lowell", the one-person cargo hauler "Nation", the one-person cargo hauler "Supernova20", the one-person fighter "Trinaos", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.

You are weightless here.

01:47:57 Board what?

01:48:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

01:48:01 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:48:05 You may not leave the airlock until its environment matches that of the ship.

01:48:05 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

01:48:07 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

01:48:08 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

01:48:09 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow. Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

01:48:15 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

01:48:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:48:16 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:48:18 You begin the launch sequence.

01:48:23 The computer locates a launch trajectory.

01:48:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:48:24 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

01:48:24 [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:48:25 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

01:48:55 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "My chart is in the spinward notation."

01:49:03 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Give it to me. Is not like you will be making use of it in Best AEU."

01:49:11 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "My earth and Mutuality one. I don't have a chart for the spinward regoins, if that's what you're wondering."

01:49:16 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Nope."

01:49:19 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Mine."

01:49:20 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I hate you."

01:49:41 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There's literally nothing you could offer for my charts!"

01:49:59 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I would never bother you for anything ever again."

01:50:07 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What about one thousand lenses and a certificate for a free oil bath."

01:50:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

01:50:18 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Or I could bother you forever."

01:50:26 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "For everything. All the time."

01:50:39 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Like you don't already."

01:50:42 [General Communication] Ali Candan whistles.

01:50:47 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (16, 11, 13)

01:50:51 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Exactly. Seems like good trade."

01:51:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:51:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:51:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:51:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:51:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:51:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:51:09 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:51:09 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "If anything I am losing out on deal."

01:51:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:51:13 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:51:16 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

01:51:18 Which sector did you mean?

01:51:34 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

01:51:35 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:51:37 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nine minutes."

01:51:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:51:42 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No deal, no deal."

01:51:59 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Pssh."

01:52:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:52:16 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:52:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:52:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:52:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:52:31 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:52:31 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:52:36 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:53:03 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:54:00 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "There needs to be some warmup music for this thing or something."

01:54:28 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Hire a band. Go big or go home. Call Voxel."

01:54:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It should be smooth jazz."

01:54:30 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm afraid it will likely not be very entertaining anyways. It's not really about that."

01:54:41 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Although, I like the way you think."

01:54:49 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Remind me to beat you for existing since you said jazz."

01:55:48 Tanny Hill does not seem to have an active communicator.

01:56:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ather...hates something? that can't be."

01:56:05 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't fucking remind me. It's all Kesi's fault that this shit is still there. I submitted a request for a change of music, but shit's happening slow at Frontier cause of the Bari crap."

01:58:04 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli is plain and has a slightly pudgy build, fair skin, grey eyes, and shoulder-length mirror finish chrome hair and he stands about five feet and ten inches tall and looks to be in his late twenties. He is wearing a pair of silver-rimmed glasses, a long white coat, a dark green AEU t-shirt, a pair of relaxed fit midnight blue jeans, and a pair of black synthleather ship boots.

01:58:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I made it in time, Eli."

01:58:19 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh hey, he's there."

01:58:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't talk in your comm, Eli. You're live."

01:58:40 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey puts down a silver projector.

01:58:58 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey switches a backdrop projector to "AEU phoenix symbol."

02:00:02 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey stands before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop in a long white coat. He straightens a dark green AEU t-shirt and clears his throat.

02:00:10 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.

02:00:19 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Eli, we see you. Can we have your autograph?"

02:00:25 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "Greetings once again citizens of the Union and the rest of the galaxy. I've returned here today to speak again of the pressing issue of Outccord and to clear up a few misconceptions about my broadcast, and to offer proof against the accusations in the media that my broadcast contained lies."

02:00:38 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would like the autograph on my butt please."

02:00:56 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "I would like to begin, by addressing what has been called a lie from my broadcast last week, the desctruction of the EAOS experimental structure. I did make a mistake by saying it was destroyed by the Outsiders. It was, instead, destroyed by our other alien threat, the IFS. A seperate alien threat that not much is known about. This fact changes nothing however, it only adds further weight to the importance of the Accord of Free Worlds."

02:01:32 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli nods grimly.

02:01:38 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "I would also like to address the recent claims that the destruction of the planet Grenwold is a hoax, and that the images I showed of it last week were just images of asteroid chunks that have always been there. This is not only untrue, it is an insult to our intelligence and to the name of the brave hero, Benjamin Masterson, who's death is undeniably linked to the desctruction of Grenwold by the Outsiders."

02:02:25 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli gesticulates with his hands while he speaks, "during the time these events occured in the resistance, the Outsiders were unable to locate the station that was serving as resistance headquarters. this was the sinister purpose behind the destruction of such a beautiful green planet. they destroyed the planet with their phase destabilizing beam, and used the path of it's debris to discover the location of the station."

02:03:32 From a phone-based holoemitter: "Something happened, that caused the station to have a power failure, I'm unaware if this was something that the Outsiders did, or if it was a result of debris hitting the station." Eli Grey frowns. "Either way, the people inside found themselves trapped. That is when Benjamin Masterson rushed to the problem and somehow restored enough power for the docking bay doors to open, allowing the people inside to escape, he could not escape himself however. He stayed behind to make sure the doors remained open. And so it was that he was the only one left inside when the Outsiders destroyed the station."

02:04:20 From a phone-based holoemitter: the ripples on Eli's blue skin slow for a moment, and it's color deepens as he speaks. "to say that Grenwold was never destroyed, that it has always been just a debris field, is to spit on the good name of the hero of humanity, Benjamin Masterson. If not for his sacrifice, the resistance would have ended there and then. Or perhaps those that claim it never happened also maintain that Masterson did not die? That these events simply never occured.

02:05:05 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli stares into the camera for a long moment, letting his words hang in the air.

02:05:27 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "I would like to show some brief footage now. I shot this footage of two of the Grenwold chunks the other day, not long after the news outlets began publishing stories about Grenwold being a hoax. Be warned, these images are disturbing."

02:05:45 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.

02:05:50 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] as the image starts, it is shakey and hard to make out at first. then, the camera steadies and the scene becomes clear.

02:05:59 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] Scraped clean of the topsoil that once covered it, this large flat piece of rock nonetheless bears traces of the   creatures who once lived here. Embedded in the scorched limestone are the petrified bones of   their distant   ancestors, their lively domiciles now nothing more than shallow pits in the ancient rock. The remnant of the   lost world turns slowly against the starry black sky, the shadows deep, the land forever

02:06:22 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] the camera zooms in on the clearly visible bones and fossils. You hear the voice of Eli Grey saying, "This is one of the chunks of Grenwold. As you can clearly see, there, those are bones of the precursors to the creatures that once called this planet their home. Asteroids do not contain fossil records."

02:06:26 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

02:06:40 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] the image goes dark as the camera is shut off, but only briefly before it's replaced by another unsettling scene.

02:06:48 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] Gently terraced rock forms the surface of this planetary remnant. Etched in its rough surface are the shapes of tiny shells and delicately-leaved plants hidden for countless millennia beneath the oceans, long dead and lost to modern knowledge. The countless stars overhead bear silent witness as the rock turns slowly in the void.

02:07:06 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] the camera zooms in once more, showing the fossilized remains of sea life and plants. A spacesuited glove comes into frame, pointing at the clearly visible remains. you hear the voice of Eli Grey saying, "Here, again, you can see what is clearly the remains of sea creatures and plants. Do asteroids have oceans? I think not."

02:07:26 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] The images transitions once more to show eli Grey standing in what appears to be the control room of a starship, wearing a long white coat.

02:07:35 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] The ripples on his blue skin seem more agitated than usual, and the light briefly glints off of a small silver dragonfly around his neck as he speaks. "doubtless some will say that this still does not prove that the Outsiders destroyed this world, Despite it being a well known historical fact from mankinds recent history. but I ask you what else could have ended what is clearly a planet, so suddenly? In such a way that the   fossil record has stayed intact?"

02:08:02 From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] eli sweeps his arm to point out of the viewport behind him, "the answer is simple, it is the Outsiders phase destabilizing beam. the same weapon that took the life of Benjamin Masterson mere moments after Grenwold was destroyed."

02:08:13 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey quickly turns off a silver projector.

02:08:27 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli stares grimly into the camera.

02:08:34 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "So, so as you can plainly see in that footage, not only did Grenwold exist, but it was certainly destroyed by something powerful, and unnatural. To say that threats like this come second to pirates, is like stopping in the middle of a raging forest fire, to worry about a snake on the ground."

02:09:03 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "It is truly threats like this, and the IFS, the the Union must not leave the Accord. Humanity is already extremely outclassed by these alien threats. The Outsiders would love nothing more than for the Accord to be weakened in this way, it is perhaps, even the moment they've been waiting for."

02:09:40 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey exclaims, "The Union must not withdrawl from the Accord! We must stand together with all humans, in the face of our extinction!"

02:11:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good job, Eli."

02:13:01 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli says, "Thank you for all who have tuned in tonight, I hope you have heeded my words well. May you al find peace, and joy in your lives." He then poses dramatically in front of an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop raising his fist in the air and shouting, "For the Union, the Accord, and humanity!" He turns to leave the studio revealing a large dragonfly on the back of his coat, leaving an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop hanging on the holo for the remainder of the broadcast.

02:13:15 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey walks out.

02:13:22 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey picks up a silver projector.

02:13:23 From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey walks out.

02:13:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cheers.

02:13:40 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Nice Eli!"

02:13:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No Q/A?"

02:13:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well spoken Eli."

02:14:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Damn well said."

02:14:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I only bought thirty minutes, Ididn't have time for that tonight sorry."

02:14:26 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Well done, Eli."

02:14:26 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I didn't know it was legal to gesticulate on the public access channel like that."

02:14:54 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I wanted to have time for folks to call in, but I only bought thirty minutes. Sorry folks. Maybe next time."

02:15:09 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Well you still have fifteen..."

02:15:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Don't worry about that. That was awesomely well done, yet again."

02:15:23 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would have probably only asked if your food-preservation appliance is currently operational."

02:15:32 [General Communication] Eli Grey laughs.

02:15:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "He left on a strong note anyway, doing Q/A would have weakened the message, I feel."

02:15:48 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "He would have. He does that."

02:17:26 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I probably should have prepared better, I could have filled more time. It snuck up on me."

02:17:40 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thank you all."

02:18:07 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I shall eagerly anticipate contradictory headlines."

02:18:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, no doubt, right?"

02:19:00 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Go back and sing a song or something."

02:19:20 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Jus tkeep the camera focused on rippling blue skin. That ought to get their attention."

02:34:53 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also, I just have to say, to Ather and Nicolette, I hate you for trying to make me laugh. I almost lost it."

02:35:12 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Next time."

02:35:42 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "It's like, for the union, for the Accord, for the huma hahahahahahahaha."

02:36:01 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Then Eli faints."

02:36:35 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Live Long And Prosper."

02:36:52 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Q news."

02:37:04 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wonder what they could possibly be reporting on already?"

02:37:14 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They're reporting on..."

02:37:15 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Urmom!"

02:37:19 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "The fact that they're on Andy's probably."

02:37:19 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Did my broadcast get all the way out there."

02:37:24 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:37:25 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "SOmebody bored and playing with the QE, probably."

02:37:33 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Same old thing."

02:37:42 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would most likely agree with the "Q news" one."

02:37:46 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Go smoke in a battlesuit Ather."

02:37:55 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Joe did tha tonce."

02:38:06 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The consequences were mildly amusing."

02:38:38 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Your face is amusing."

02:38:38 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Much as I hate to say it...I'm going to sort of make like Ted here and say if you want to know what the news is, stay home. I leave to get away from news ordinarily, I'm not going to send home requesting it."

02:38:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cheers.

02:38:55 [General Communication] Johann Schraft cheers.

02:38:56 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm so proud."

02:40:53 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "It usually is."

02:42:15 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Somebody could make like Akemi and go down to 270 and send them a newscast. But that somebody won't be me."

02:42:20 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "The message says bonk unfortunately."

02:42:30 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:42:34 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Bonk!"

02:43:10 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Don't think people will properly use the damn thing like ever."

02:43:42 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Somebody bored, like I said."

02:43:43 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I remember when I thought I was going to miss the resistance party one time, I actually calculated right down to the minute how long it would take me to send a full resistance anniversary speech over QE comms so that it would arrive right on midnight on Resistance day."

02:43:53 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That was almost certainly Emily."

02:44:09 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Yep."

02:44:20 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The speech I was going to send was going to be 8 hours and change long. So you can imagine the calculations."

02:44:24 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Yes. Yes it was."

02:44:46 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I love calculations."

02:45:00 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Isn't it like a minute and 21 seconds per character?"

02:45:13 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, or so."

02:45:18 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Ather, nobody is going to listen to an eight hour speech in person, much less spread out over the two years that would take on the qe."

02:45:32 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No, I meant the speech that I wrote up would've taken 8 hours to send, man."

02:45:39 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Is joke."

02:46:27 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Should I tell them about the mothership cleaning news thing? I mean, they already know that it was going on anyway."

02:46:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na."

02:46:44 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "If they cared that much, they would have stayed home."

02:46:54 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "That is stupid reasoning."

02:47:02 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not cause of that, but cause it's not really important news that we need to act on."

02:47:13 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "That is better reasoning."

02:47:27 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am generally full of sound reasoning."

02:47:47 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Idea that you should not send news because if they wanted news they should stay home is stupid."

02:47:50 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "So let's do a nest or something."

03:04:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "About getting inside someone's head. I've been trying to do that, but with this particular person it's a bit difficult."

03:04:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Maybe doing some research on 'em would help."

03:05:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's a ctualy a good secondary weapon."

03:05:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, yes. It's more that I thought he knew how'd he react, and then I was wrong, we all were in a way."

03:06:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's handy for interrupting abilities and things, cause it has a shorter firing time. Doesn't deal as much damage though."

03:06:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, it's nice and quick for a secondary weapon."

03:06:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, what Ather said."

03:15:25 [General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:15:29 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:15:52 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow, didn't think she'd share it that quickly."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

04:30:17 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

10:22:18 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

10:22:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

10:22:20 There appear to be about 11 pilots recently active.

11:10:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

11:32:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What? Still no headlines?"

11:32:19 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nope."

11:35:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Man I dunno why I haven't done this in ages. I didn't realize how much I missed it."

11:35:27 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What haven't you done in ages?"

11:35:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "A full load of comets. Like nothing but. It takes a while, but I enjoy it."

11:36:04 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Comets are the best."

11:36:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have a little over 123000 units of storage. So...yeah. it takes a while."

11:37:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Shipwrecks are my total favorite, but comets come in a close second."

11:37:56 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The accord sends me to get lots of medium-size outsider wrecks now."

11:38:03 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The missions are so great, like 3 of them fill my ship up."

11:38:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh, accord missions rock."

11:39:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I totally gaped when I got my first large outsider wrecks. Like...2 of them. and my ship was full. I was like..."Um. holy shit?""

11:39:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

11:39:54 [General Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "I agree about wrecks. That's why I love 777 more than anywhere else when it comes to salvaging."

11:41:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Damn right. That's why I've put so much effort into keeping that place around, even though plenty of folks don't like it. I love it out there, even now."

11:41:15 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh that place is great."

11:41:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't go to the bubble yet but I'm going to miss 777 once I can, I think."

11:41:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I probably won't go out there as much."

11:41:43 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Haven't been there yet. Probably don't have the grappler grade for it."

11:42:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's still worth going out there for the wrecks. Plenty of artifacts at the bubble, but not a single bit of salvage."

11:42:23 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Lexie, can you grapple grade 20 to 40?"

11:42:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think 40 might be good for a grapple."

11:42:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ahh then maybe I do."

11:44:42 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do stealth modules do?"

11:44:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like for stations."

11:46:02 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'd rather respond to that here. Those modules make a station appear smaller. So that it attracts less attention from things like outsiders. IFS. And the like."

11:46:19 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

11:46:34 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's good to have."

11:47:29 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you're worried about the station attracting attention, sure. But I don't normally use them unless it's for maybe a beacon, or if I'm really trying to fit every org on a station."

11:48:03 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are they expensive?"

11:48:15 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nah."

11:49:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you wanna take a look at prices and things for station parts, you could always poke your nose into the module shop on accord, get an idea for things."

11:49:23 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I should do that."

11:49:30 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm making the 285 asteroid processor."

11:49:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cooking up a station."

11:49:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles. "Don't forget Nicolette's org."

11:49:59 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

11:50:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Or she'll attack with claws."

11:50:14 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In Lily's instructions, she wouldn't list Nicolette's org by name."

11:50:30 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I was looking over everything she wrote and I was like huh, she never said which org it was."

11:50:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's the shit org."

11:50:44 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I found out in the end."

11:50:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

11:50:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Right Nicolette?"

11:51:24 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "What?"

11:51:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Nothing just talking shit."

11:51:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If you're ever after any parts from her and Lily doesn't have any. Feel free to check our spare parts ship. She always keeps it full of shit."

11:52:01 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

11:52:11 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I should be a core on Lily's constructor."

11:52:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

11:52:18 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Or should have one that is."

11:52:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, there's one from you in there."

11:52:44 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That's the core you use on the processor at 285. That's why it's there."

11:52:56 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The only thing I had to get from another ship was a stealth module from rift surfers."

11:53:10 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But that's why you have a key. Trust me when I tell you, sometimes us station builders have to go station building ship raiding. Sometimes you gotta scrounge parts from anywhere you can."

11:54:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sometimes it feels like you're hunting for a needle in a stack of needles. It's like. "Okay. I need a seekers battery. Nope. None on that ship. Or that one. Or that one...fuck sakes.""

11:55:04 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, Lily's constructor is like some kind of ridiculous junkyard."

11:55:30 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might never be heard from again if I take a wrong turn down here."

11:55:50 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "She prefers the term unclaimed reclaimed salvagable components depot."

11:55:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You think that's bad? You should see how Mel's ship looks sometimes. Or hell, our main building ship for that matter. I've had 28 modules on that thing more than once. I'm like...Holy crap."

11:56:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

11:56:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Now. The cats spare parts ship...walk carefully. that shit is scary."

11:58:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh, Nicolette?"

11:58:38 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "What?"

11:58:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Nothing just talking shit."

11:58:52 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence sighs.

11:58:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Do you need me to check on the 288 stuff, at some point soon?"

11:59:04 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Honestly I have no idea I was ignoring it."

11:59:11 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Nah, with so many gone, not gonna worry about it."

11:59:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sure thing."

11:59:32 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's in 288?"

11:59:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And hush with that sighing, Nicolette. You make more shit jokes than all of us put together."

11:59:47 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "If they calla nd ask for an accelerator to be put out there, I'll do it, but I assume they'll come back more or less the way they went."

12:00:19 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Shit is the shit. No shit."

12:00:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

12:01:53 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."

12:02:10 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh dear."

12:02:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This list says RUNE is supposed to contribute the control center, but I don't see one on their ship."

12:02:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "When is it going down?"

12:03:10 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe in another 16 hours or so."

12:03:10 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Rune is a joke. Get another one and forget about it, they don't get anything really from being on the station in the first place."

12:03:23 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

12:03:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Okay. If you've got around 16 hours. Send Keegan a letter. Letting him know you need a top. If you still don't have one closer to the time. Use another part."

12:03:56 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

12:03:59 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "If there's not one where it's supposed to be, don't worry about them, that's not your job."

12:04:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "She's right!"

12:04:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys are both right!"

12:04:23 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well no, but it's 16 hours. That's a fair amount of time for him to get a top."

12:04:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I don't mind shooting him a letter."

12:04:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got nothing going on."

12:05:09 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If a station has a good amount of time, that's what I usually do. I'll also nudge him if I see him awake, and let him know that rune needs more tops on their ship."

12:06:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But if a station doesn't have long...I always do what Nicolette said. if there's no part from the org, they don't get on it, it's that simple. If you can't keep parts on your ship, that's not the station builders problem."

12:06:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Harsh is the world of station building."

12:06:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Heavy lies the station top."

12:07:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Meodramatic is the Constantine."

12:07:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is. But I'm not screwing around letting stations go down. Just so that they can be perfect. Keep your shit up to date on your spare parts ship. And you won't have a problem with me. Meaning orgs in general. Of course."

12:07:06 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

12:07:27 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I get that."

12:07:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wanted to do it early because I don't 100% know what I'm doing."

12:07:53 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if I had like an hour to go I would just use one of the 13 allied libs ones."

12:08:03 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That Lily has rows and rows of."

12:08:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Exactly. And if you're in a rush or need a hand, I meant what I said in the letter. I've built most stations that we keep around before, and I'll be more than happy to lend a hand."

12:09:01 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome! Didn't you need help with a beacon chain or something soon?"

12:09:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I helped Morris do one and he even salvaged me."

12:09:19 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I'm basically an expert or whatever."

12:09:24 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I most likely will, yeah."

12:09:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I could help with that if you need help."

12:10:00 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh don't you worry. I'll always poke around for a hand when I need it."

12:10:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Careful she might chop one off too, just to keep a spare around."

12:11:21 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

12:11:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

12:12:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hmmm."

12:13:30 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "One performance goal down! One to go!"

12:16:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I so wanna train Zeus how to build stations. That would rock."

12:17:00 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport laughs.

12:17:09 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who's Zeus?"

12:17:12 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi all."

12:17:17 I don't understand that.

12:17:27 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Is it tike to wake up yet?"

12:17:37 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Er, time."

12:17:39 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was about to go to bed."

12:17:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I feel like no."

12:17:43 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Mel's lizard. We sorta share him. Because Mel is nice like that. He's most often with me. Because I'm a touch obsessed."

12:17:53 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

12:17:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

12:18:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity. It's Shule. Everyone go to bed. Run. Flee."

12:18:39 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'll go back to sleep... for now."

12:19:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Good. Have nightmares about my revenge because you did not include me on awesome clipper beacons."

12:19:19 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cackles!

12:19:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

12:19:53 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awww, be nice! I would have... but but... Ummm, there wasn't room."

12:20:00 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

12:20:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Mmhmm, sure."

12:22:15 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Everyone should always believe everything I say."

12:22:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

12:33:04 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

12:34:00 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have 4 pirate scouts in the belt of orion, if anyone could lend a hand. I'm in a transport."

12:34:24 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I can in a moment if you can get out, but I have to get back to my ship with guns."

12:34:28 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Will be there."

12:34:40 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Appreciated."

12:35:22 [Tactical Communication] Gonzales Bourne transmits, "Seems to be clear."

12:35:42 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They must have ran when you entered. Thanks gonz."

12:38:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Aww! If a starship name could be cute...That's cute. I love that, Nicolette."

12:39:48 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "It was time for a change, and to spend 18 million credits for no good reason."

12:39:58 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Just because."

12:40:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I really like that. It's a cool spin on the old name."

12:40:17 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "It is."

12:40:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But now that means, you gotta use the thing."

12:40:48 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "It was either going to be that or else the shit show. I decided to play it safe."

12:40:55 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

13:07:50 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:07:50 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed.

You can go south, up, and out.

13:07:53 Not much to see out there.

13:07:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:07:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:07:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:08:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:08:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:08:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:08:16 Which sector did you mean?

13:08:17

Enter your selection:

13:08:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:08:18 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:08:19 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

13:08:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:08:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:08:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:08:25 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: -yG*d_!EWAS.MVRf0)Uxp_R+i"]YJw`qdp*V"D0R
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:08:26 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

13:08:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:08:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:08:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:08:30 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:08:30 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

13:08:30 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

13:08:34 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

13:08:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

13:09:34 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:09:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:09:49 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:56:03 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:56:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

16:57:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well Tara, looks not many saw my broadcast last night, I think? Unless this is why Dannikin is asking culwyn to step down perhaps. That name sounds awfully familiar."

16:58:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good morning tobias, I am not sure that we have met? You also sound a bit familiar."

16:58:53 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "We have, briefly, at that meeting a while back. Been some weeks."

16:59:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I hope the Green Earth party knows what they're doing. According to the headlines I've seen lately, Miss Cullwyn has been the only opposition to Outccord, at least in the media."

17:00:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."

17:00:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And the only one I've seen in the little news that we get, that's openly opposed OUtccord. I'm sure the party as a whole is against it, but she's been the only one I've personally seen in the news."

17:01:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I actaully meant to thank her in my broadcast, though who knws, that might have done her more harm than good."

17:01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, they need to be more publically noticable of they want to have an impact. Maybe that's what Danniken's angle is. The leader guides the rest, you know?"

17:01:56 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "It seems you've had a lot of flack to deal with lately."

17:02:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's possible. I'm not sure how to feel about this news. It could be good, or it could be bad.. I'm gonna see what I can find out about Mister Dannikin, that name is really familiar. I'm almost positive I've seen it in the news at some point."

17:36:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "They may have left by now, it was a quarter hour ago."

17:36:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:36:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:36:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:36:54 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: w>3gq_`V_VbgxGoakPzgYm-oMq=]y!MJvw>Cz}ki
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

17:37:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:37:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:37:04 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:37:04 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

17:37:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:37:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anyone of you want to go build the accel and inserter in 285 and then bill morris for the parts later?"

17:37:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:37:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

AEU scout "Lordy, The Rocks!" departed to AEU sector The Old Frontier (Beta-3) approximately 9 minutes ago.

17:37:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did you see what kind it was? Sometimes there's a pirate salvager. They're still intruding, but if you leave them alone, they'll leave you alone. Attacking them only makes them call for backup."

17:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It jumped already. Peackeepers are there."

17:38:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Peacekeepers."

17:38:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Bane-class light gunboat."

17:39:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:39:34 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:39:37 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

17:39:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, I saw that on the ftl traces."

17:39:42 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

17:39:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:39:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And yes, Tara. Good idea."

17:40:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:40:01 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:40:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:40:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:40:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I actually seemingly had a Peacekeeper escort last night, not sure if it was intentional or just a coincidence, but it was nice. They jumped with me all the way from Orion to the Accord command."

17:40:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:40:21 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:40:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Very cool!"

17:40:31 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:40:31 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:40:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Honestly Eli I need space combat and well we all know there are like maybe five people total right now willing to work with me."

17:41:03 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

17:41:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Alright, any of you up for beacons?"

17:41:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You had to say that while I was bringing a rock back."

17:41:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Vernos, Morris went ahead and put it up before he left I'm sure. You probably just saw the old one go down."

17:41:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Never done a beacon before."

17:41:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Heh, I can wait."

17:41:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He said something about it before they left."

17:41:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ome one, come all."

17:42:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Come one."

17:42:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I tried jumping to 285 and the computer reported the distance too far."

17:42:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Tara, do you know how to gun?"

17:42:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, I gunned for constance once. But it was agaisnt RATs."

17:43:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "That's ok. It's still the same. Come join me on beacons. Anyone else?"

17:43:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I don't bite... often."

17:43:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Or too hard."

17:44:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'll be on the landing pad on new earth then!"

17:44:25 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "One for beacons?"

17:44:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Actually, meet in the lounge."

17:44:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not a good idea to congregate on the landing pad."

17:44:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

17:44:53 You can go out and enter into the ship.

17:44:55 You exit the ship.

17:44:55 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

17:44:59 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

17:44:59 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Tara Flores is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.

17:45:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You might get a landing strut to the head."

17:45:11 Tara Flores waves towards you.

17:45:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's happened. It doesn't feel very good."

17:45:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "See though Vernos? Shule didn't say anything about excluding you. I can't speak for him but I believe, "come one, come all" Kinda covers it."

17:45:22 You wave to Tara Flores.

17:45:27 Tara Flores speaks into her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:45:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh. That sounds painful."

17:45:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It was."

17:45:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh I don't worry about Shule excluding me. Perhaps his woman though."

17:46:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "My woman is over 300 lightyears away."

17:46:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Kind of tough for her to do anything from that distance."

17:46:34 A pair of pilots stride in haughtily, glimmering with gold and diamonds.

17:46:38 You smile at Tara Flores.

17:46:49 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Last call. One for beacons."

17:46:58 Tara says to you, "What should I expect on a beacon?"

17:46:58 You say to Tara, "We can take a scout."

17:47:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "But yeah I think I even slept in the voice office last night waiting to hear something back from them."

17:47:30 You say to Tara, "Just several ships. I will track them for you and you just aim and shoot."

17:47:44 You hold Tara Flores's hand, taking her into your group.

17:47:45 Tara Flores exclaims, "Sounds easy enough!"

17:47:48 You grin.

17:47:49 Tara Flores stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

17:47:51 You're already standing.

17:47:54 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

17:47:54 You can go up.
Tara Flores followed you.

17:47:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Woo 2 million for an asteroid because of insurance."

17:48:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll get 285 later if I can, though I'm not a big fan of going out of comms range at the moment. Let's wait and see if someone else has already elected to take care of it. The only ones I was asked to take care of before everyone left was the bubble ones."

17:48:13 You say, "Sec."

17:48:16 Tara Flores nods.

17:48:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So there may already be someone who will be on it."

17:48:20 You say, "We need to go to the Torus."

17:48:27 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

17:48:27 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Tara Flores followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

17:48:30 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

17:48:30 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Tara Flores followed you.

17:48:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:48:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:48:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:48:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:48:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:48:45 The ship is already moving.

17:48:47 The ship is already moving.

17:48:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:48:48 Which sector did you mean?

17:48:48

17:48:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

17:48:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:48:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:48:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:48:57 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

17:49:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:49:10 Tara Flores says, "Damage control."

17:49:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well I would have done it but Eva and Morris decided it was a good idea to kick me out over all this."

17:49:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:49:18 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

17:49:18 You say, "Ok, so you will just be repairing and shooting."

17:49:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

17:49:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:49:30 Tara Flores asks, "Damage control is up above too?"

17:49:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:49:33 You nod.

17:49:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:49:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:49:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

17:49:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Tara Flores is standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.

17:49:42 Tara Flores says, "Got it."

17:49:58 Tara Flores walks up.

17:49:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:50:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:50:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:50:10 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

17:50:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:50:16 a decoy beacon launcher

17:50:16 You see that it is loaded with 0 decoy beacons.

17:50:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Guessing that was you doing a clipper instead since no one answered for that spot, Shule."

17:50:28 You need a free hand to take that.

17:50:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'd be willing to bet that Evenia will do it."

17:50:32 I don't understand that.

17:50:35 You are carrying a fine piece of paper with an official header reading "From the founder of Allied Libertarians" in your right hand, and a metallic gold touch einrophone in your left hand.

17:50:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."

17:50:38 Tara Flores's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Seven turrets. This'll be fun."

17:50:42 You place a metallic gold touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

17:50:48 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep."

17:50:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Nah, I had to switch to a scout."

17:51:00 I don't understand that ("w" is an ambiguous name).

17:51:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'd be willing to bet that Eveni's going to do it, she seemed to be assigned to some of them."

17:51:09 You remove a decoy beacon from a leather briefcase.

18:25:27 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:25:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:25:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:25:31 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:25:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

18:25:32 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:25:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:25:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:25:35 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:25:37 I don't understand that.

18:25:38 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Striking Distance! Welcome to home space!"

18:25:39 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

18:25:39 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:25:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Striking Distance. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

18:25:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:25:46 You hug Tara Flores. "Thanks for coming along."

18:25:52 You say, "And great job."

18:25:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:25:54 You are credited with 3,720,573.18 AEU credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

18:26:00 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:26:04 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:26:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:26:17 Tara Flores smiles to you "You're welcome." then she blinks "Even more credits?!"

18:26:21 You grin.

18:26:22 You say, "Yep."

18:26:37 Your ship 'Striking Distance' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:26:37 Tara Flores exclaims, "How am I gona spend twenty one million?!"

18:26:42 You laugh.

18:26:49 You say, "Oh, that's just the beginning1."

18:26:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nice."

18:27:17 You say, "You'll soon have way more than that."

18:27:28 Tara grins to you "Thanks for bringing me along. It was intense."

18:27:34 You say, "Any time."

18:27:45 Tara Flores says, "I'll be awake later."

18:27:50 You exclaim, "Awesome!"

18:27:53 You hug Tara Flores.

18:27:54 Tara Flores waves to you.

18:27:55 You say, "Rest well."

18:27:57 I don't understand that.

18:27:59 Tara Flores hugs you.

18:28:00 You wave to Tara Flores.

18:28:01 Tara Flores exclaims, "Will do!"

18:28:04 Tara Flores walks out.

18:28:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'll be resting for a while, though! See you all later!"

18:32:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ha! AEU comms supremacy."

18:33:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting headline."

18:33:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You look at this, Eli?"

18:43:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I did eaf the headline onstatine, sorry I couldn't get to my comms."

18:44:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though, I'm unsure whether this is good or bad. Culwyn,  so far has been the only one to speak publicly about being in opposition to Outccord, but perhaps Dannikin believes she should be doing more."

18:44:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries."

18:45:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My thoughts exactly, I don't dislike Culwyn, but this could still be good."

18:45:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The party has kind of been dragging its feet because it isn't really united behind Culwyn."

18:45:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Very true."

18:46:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I wonder how van Dannikin would react if he knew about the livestock restrictions we were trying ot get out of."

18:46:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:46:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Bet he and the party would really hate that."

18:46:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, no dbout. Though I'm sure they're likely aware."

18:47:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."

18:47:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're probably right."

18:47:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We'll have to see what happens, I'm going to go through the news archive and see what I can find out about Danikin."

18:49:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm."

18:50:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might come look for you later and talk about this, Eli."

18:50:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, if I have time.. I might be a bit busy today."

18:50:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, no worries."

18:51:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone know if doing Accord missions actually does anything for our respective alliances?"

18:54:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Shit."

18:54:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I knew that name sounded familiar, fucking hell."

18:55:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Dannikin is the Union spokesperson who's heading the Outccord campaign, this is no good."

18:55:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Dannikin is the Union spokesperson who's heading the Outccord campaign, this is no good."

18:56:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He's the guy saying that we spend the ludicrous sum of 500 billion a week on the Accord."

18:57:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey growls.

19:01:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It doesn't make sense.. One minute Dannikin is leading the Union on Outccord, then the enxt he's telling culwyn to step down and let someone capable of real oppisition take over. don't do it culwyn! don't do it!"

19:03:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you are hearing this, or if it reaches your ears Miss Culwyn, don't step down! We need you!"

19:03:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're right."

19:04:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Dannikin just wants you to step down so that there's no opposition at all! Please,  don't!"

19:22:34 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"

19:44:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, you around, ELi?"

19:44:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry about that."

19:56:51 [MTTS] Ulias: That can be closed, I thought it would give the "is this a thanks" response.

20:02:09 [MTTS] Ulias: On a die note, I'm having the time of my life with these current storylines.

20:02:14 [MTTS] Ulias: Er.. side note.

20:02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sorry.. constantine, did you say something?"

20:03:29 [MTTS] Squidmind: What's that you say, you want people to die in the plot?

20:03:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I thought we might talk through this Culwyn situation if you have a minute."

20:03:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though we could discuss it over comms, I think."

20:03:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So my understanding of the situation was flawed."

20:03:50 [MTTS] me: No death.

20:04:00 [MTTS] Ulias: Hahahahah.

20:04:03 [MTTS] me: Unless... well Hehehehe. Unless it is warranted?

20:04:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think that Culwyn and the rest of the party know about the negotiations van Dannikin is carrying out?"

20:04:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Absolutely."

20:05:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not just that he's the negotiator, but specifically that he's trying to get the Union out of environmental regulations?"

20:05:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think we made an assumption that Dannikin was party of the Green Earth party, I don't believe he is."

20:05:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

20:06:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think this was the opposing party calling her competence into question."

20:06:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ohh, that makes sense."

20:06:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know why I instantly assumed he was part of some faction within the green party that opposes Culwyn."

20:07:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well the headline kinda sound that way at first."

20:07:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, well maybe this could unite the green party a bit more, then."

20:07:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hearing their enemies publicly calling for their leader's removal."

20:07:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, or they'll use it to support her argument."

20:08:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er their argument."

20:08:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's also possible."

20:10:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's been some rumors that they want to replace her, they may see this as an opportunity to do that. Though with her party not being fully behind her, she doesn't strike me as a woman who will simply step down because someone says that she should. I hope she doesn't."

20:11:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If she does, I hope whoever takes her place, is ready to step up and fight for the Accord."

20:14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, a strong Green Earth would really help."

20:14:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The simple fact that Dannikin has called for her to step down, simply proves that she is capable of the opposition he claims that she is not capable of. At least to me."

20:15:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean really, if you are winning, then why would someone ask for someone to better oppose them. It doesn't make sense."

20:15:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed, he would never say that to anyone who he thought wasn't a threat."
