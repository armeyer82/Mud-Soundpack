00:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And yes. It would be bad. Especially if there are things there that have torpedos or minicannons."

00:17 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "This is so my luck. The one time I forget to put up a station early, someone needs the thing."

00:18 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I have 56 minutes to go."

00:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Okay so uh. Try and like. Pee super fast and land yourself on either the processor or accelerator."

02:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I might or might not have hid, after I sent the package."

02:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You probably shoulda."

02:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:19 [General Communication] Ryan Thomas transmits, "Can you give me a call? I don't seem to have your number."

02:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I don't have yours either."

02:19 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

02:20 [General Communication] Ryan Thomas transmits, "0200-28956."

02:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Man...Now I want a felo with big enough wings so that it can fly. With stunning indigo feathers, and a beautiful long-feathered tail. I have also put way too much thought into the indigo feathered felo bird."

02:22 [General Communication] Clarina Taylor laughs.

02:22 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "That would be pretty."

02:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I still am lookin for a white either winged or feathered felo I can name Great Wing."

02:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you'd said long-eared..."

02:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope. Don't think Great Wing had long ears."

02:24 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "I'd name a gold winged or feathered felo more than likely angel. But not seen gold feathered. Just red feathered."

02:24 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If a white feathered or winged pops up. I'll tell you. I've got a couple white felo around. So who knows."

02:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Um...we might end up with one on the org ship Ari. I just might have to move a couple gold over there."

02:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks."

02:24 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Gold feathered are around. There's Johann's avery, and I only recently had gold feathered on one of my ships."

02:24 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "I moved one of my gold and that gold armored over there."

02:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I stole the gold armored."

02:24 [General Communication] Morris Corlew coughs.

02:25 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "But I've got a red feathered or 2. And red and indigo long eared roaming round my transport. Kind of want to take all but the feathered off and see what I get."

02:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you're doin somethin like that over there, lemme know. I won't mess with a project if you're usin it for that."

02:25 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Nope I'm not using it for a project."

02:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you have red long-eared, they will take over your life."

02:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But I like to mix an armored in with my soldiers from time to time."

02:26 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Hey it's comunal org felo. So all good."

02:26 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Com fuck. What ever."

02:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

02:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What?"

02:26 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Sorry bashed my head against the wall since talking tonight was a mistake on my part."

02:26 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Red has become like orange felo. But red is more sly about it. You don't think it's taking over. Till you're looking around. And all you see is a sea of red felo."

02:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. I've never not had red telepaths...that's what I started out with."

02:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I started with gold, and now guess what's creeping in?"

02:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:27 [General Communication] Clarina Taylor transmits, "Red?"

02:28 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Rose is still my red pet telepath. And still roaming around my apartment. At 3 months old. How. Long does a felo live for? If it's a pet any way. The non pet ones seem to live for a week. Or maybe 2."

02:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anywhere from a couple months to maybe 20."

02:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Months that is."

02:28 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Holy. Fuck."

02:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Very short, unfortunately."

02:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The longest I had a pet live was...My Kayo. I got her just after my first month as a pilot, so she lived like 16 months I think it was."

02:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I miss my BoltSong. Never did get him to fully trust me."

02:28 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "A felo living for 20 months? That's not short that's like forever..."

02:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's very short. Humans live 100 yearsish."

02:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My ma's cat lived to be 26 years."

02:29 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Then on the other end of that, tiffy is looking gray around the mouth and I've had her...maybe three months."

02:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Even that's short."

02:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. Eve, member that mean hummer we worked on?"

02:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew coughs. "I mean."

02:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew sighs.

02:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The yella one?"

02:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He only lived 2 months."

02:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And I gave him tonic right outta the nest."

02:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's...What the hell."

02:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

02:31 [General Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "I wish I knew what happened to Erik. He was gonna give us some super long haired felo, and then he kind of just never responded."

02:31 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And Keegan's telepath, scherzo...wasn't much longer. Even though that one came from the same nest as Kumquat and Wobbles."

02:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They were super cool too, the mean humming felo."

02:31 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

02:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm sorry Aisling."

02:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Aww. It was your first wobbles that made me fall in love with the stumblers. I've had one in the pet family ever since."

02:32 [General Communication] Saralynn Timothy transmits, "He said he had a few gold ones and a blue one, I think."

02:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I can look later Sara."

02:32 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Chuisle is still alive, but is old now."

02:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."

02:33 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Very long lived."

02:33 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Awww. I remember Wobbles from a few trips."

02:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, if you want another telepath, holler. I've almost always got kittens."

02:34 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I like humming felo. Maybe after Chuisle leaves me I will consider another."

02:34 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And your beautiful silver one Aisling? With the cool little feet? I suppose he's passed away too?"

02:34 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Oh my yes. A long time ago."

02:34 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I still have photos of him. I have photos of them all actually. He was a sweetheart."

02:36 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Silver felo exist?"

02:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

02:36 [General Communication] Steven Timothy transmits, "I've got some silvers."

02:36 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Oh my god I think I'm in love. I like silver."

02:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "They do. I can give you one if you'd like one."

02:36 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I would also take a blind felo."

02:36 [General Communication] Clarina Taylor transmits, "I wanna silver feloooo!"

02:36 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Wonder if silver winged or feathered exist."

02:36 [General Communication] Steven Timothy transmits, "We've got plenty!"

02:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I used to have more of 'em. Had some telepaths. But the gold took over."

02:36 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They do Ari."

02:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Clari did Blake give you guys the pet he got from me, for you?"

02:37 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Let's try again, anyone up for megapod, nest, or have red want to go GMG?"

02:37 [General Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Oh god. If I wasn't out at 134. Eve I'd love a silver if you can spare one. But I'll probably not make it back until sometime later today."

02:42 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

02:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Tracking Arrays:
ITERATIVE TARGET TRACKER (Endymion)
Requirements: 0 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 70%

COALITION STANDARD TT ARRAY MK II (Drydock)
Requirements: 0 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%

CHETUMAL ORBITAL DEFENSE STANDARD TT ARRAY (Bikura)
Requirements: 20 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 100%

EAOS FIBER OPTIC TT ARRAY MK I (bikura)
Requirements: 300 combat points
Maximum Targets: 2 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 100%

LUNA IMPROVED TT ARRAY (Endymion)
Requirements: 600 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 2 units Near Target Retention: 100% Far Target Retention: 50%

FRINGE NAVAL MASSIVELY PARALLEL TT ARRAY (endymion)
Requirements: 700 combat points
Maximum Targets: 3 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%

Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement information and send that information to your gunners.

16:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a

16:07 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

16:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

16:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:07 The ship is already moving.

16:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Steel Phoenix Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'll get you one."

17:05 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

17:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

17:05 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:05 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:05 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:05 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

17:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:05 The ship is already moving.

17:05 The ship is already moving.

17:05 The ship is already moving.

17:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:05 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:05 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

17:06 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:06 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:06 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

17:06 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:06 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:06 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to The Torus!"

17:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

17:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:06 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:06 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

17:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Defensive Dissidence. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

17:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah, that is strange as the key isn't listed to."

17:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:07 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:07 You scramble to your feet.

18:01 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

18:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

21:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
