Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black
plastic tray of spider chow here.

off by barriers because of continuing construction there, a scattering of lush
ferns and an arrangement of a comfortably padded couch and armchair upholstered
in silver gray leather, with a polished Velourian oak table between them,
invites one to linger. Near the escalator is a small souvenir store, its
entrance decorated with an arch of fancy wrought iron.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident responds, "I'm listening."
A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Steel Phoenix patrols have figured out how they
invade local space. They don't depend on Outsider Magistrates or anything like
that, thank all that's holy. Instead they use their own battleships and stage
out of those. And I mean real battleships. Bigger than most of everything we've
ever fielded."
[Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you ever need something
that isn't tier 5. I'll gladly help out too. As I always have."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident responds, "I see why you need us."
A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Yeah. I'm not going to pretend this will be easy.
But here's the plan: We're going to send a patrol to entice one of their
battleships near our space. We'll draw it out to a few sectors west. You'll then
need to approach it and disable its weapons. Once it's safe, board it and
disable it in the usual way that you handle these things. That is, with
battlesuits."
[Tactical Communication] Ather "Goodness" Jammoa transmits, "It's appreciated!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident responds, "Oh, is that all?"
A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Yes. As I said, not easy. But we'll get
everything ready for you. Get a good well-rounded group of four battlesuits
ready and head out west. We'll try to have the target lined up for you."

[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple
cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval

[Starship "Daisy May"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.

This is a slim, angular battlesuit, painted dark purple with subdued dark yellow
trim. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A narrow cockpit encases
the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of
hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A thick gravitic weapon
attachment is mounted to the right forearm. A set of moderately thick armor
plating covers much of the suit. A bulky grenade launcher is mounted to the
right shoulder. A long missile launcher is mounted to the left shoulder.
It appears to be 0% damaged.

[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple
cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval
white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, Emmylou
the humanoid service robot, a hefty indigo felo, a medium-sized indigo felo, and
a red soldier felo here.

This office is small but elegant, the recessed lighting shining softly over pale
green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with
an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of
the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners
of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The
door is open.

out to Ather "Goodness" Jammoa, Shule Elemmire and myself for earning a very
interesting Battlesuit. Thanks to Damien Alexander from Fringe who kindly
assisted with leading with his League Paladin. We certainly want to complete
more of these Starship Boarding operations and are here to assist. I know that
the new Testudinidae Battlesuit will be a very strong Battlesuit and one that I
am proud to own! I see others working hard out there on nests and Low Deployment
Missions as well. In the meantime, fight hard on the ground! [01:57  7 January

New Minor Changes:
-----
Certain factions should be less inclined to hang out in places they're not mad
at. Also, if they do, they should no longer drop interdictors for the fun of it,
although those interdictors shouldn't have affected anyone they were friendly
with anyway.
   Posted 10 hours, 45 minutes, and 41 seconds ago

The Space Market is now accessible remotely! You can do this with an interface
sold at your local FTL communications store, or with a phone plan addon. The
Space Market help file explains the exact process.

changelog
Recent Major Changes:
-----
Two new advanced battlesuit classes are now available.
One is available through a mission that has to do with a certain mythical bird
of unlikely composition, because the AEU needs a battlesuit to fill its role
rather urgently. Though the mission and the battlesuit are available only to AEU
players at present, players of other alliances are mechanically able to assist
with the mission if they so choose. An equivalent Accord mission will come
relatively soon.
The second new battlesuit is available through the Megapod raids and also fills
a role that certain ground combatants may be missing, though its need is not as
urgent. It's available among the possible loot of the newest raid type. Please
look forward to arguing over who gets it first!

RATS nests will now be found amongst debris fields only. The previous generation

this change will make more sense thematically.

Certain factions should be less inclined to hang out in places they're not mad
at. Also, if they do, they should no longer drop interdictors for the fun of it,
although those interdictors shouldn't have affected anyone they were friendly
with anyway.

sold at your local FTL communications store, or with a phone plan addon. The

Star Conquest Help: Space Market
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Space Markets are structures floating in space, generally above capital worlds
and stations, that enable pilots to buy and sell items. The things you find here
can be difficult to acquire elsewhere: crafted items, blueprints, items from
raids, and so on. You might also just find cheaper hand-me-downs!
You can also access the Space Market remotely with a remote Space Market
interface from your local FTL communications store. This is also available as an
einrophone addon. Any purchases you make remotely will be sent to you after
about ten minutes.
If you wish to sell an item remotely, first place everything you wish to sell
into a mail package and send it to Space Market. You may then use your remote
interface to complete the listing process.
You do not automatically receive your profits from selling. Make sure to go and
collect your proceeds periodically!
Note that physical Space Markets contain sections for books, films, and other
visual media. These sections are not accessible remotely, but there are many
good things here, so check them out!
