Note: Not all spaceports possess the starship locator function.

00:27 The ship's radio crackles and you hear Shule Elemmire ask, "Are you heading back to The torus?"

00:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Are you heading back to The torus?"

00:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep about to land."

00:27 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

00:27 [Enter `yes' or `no']

00:27 You remove the components of your spacesuit and place them neatly into a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side.

00:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I want to show you something."

00:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ooo ok."

00:27 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

00:28 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:28 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

00:28 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:28 You say to Lily Kaise, "Hi my love."

00:28 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:28 You're already standing.

00:28 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

00:28 Lily Kaise grins at you.

00:28 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

00:28 You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go down and out.
Lily Kaise followed you.

00:28 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

00:28 You grin.

00:28 You beam with unparalleled satisfaction.

00:28 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow you got that fast!"

00:28 You say, "I did."

00:29 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow this ship is amazing!"

00:29 You say, "It works great! I already tried it in a beacon drop."

00:29 I don't understand that.

00:30 You beam.

00:30 Lily Kaise says, "Put a plant in here."

00:30 Lily Kaise says, "The grid will fall on its face though perhaps haha."

00:30 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:30 You laugh.

00:30 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:30 You say, "Yeah, I'm kind of worried about that."

00:30 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:30 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:31 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I would try without it first worst case though is just purge the plant."

00:31 You say, "You caught me in the middle of a beacon drop when you asked me what I was up to."

00:31 Lily Kaise says, "Oops sory."

00:31 You laugh.

00:31 You say, "It's ok."

00:31 Lily Kaise says, "But you're giving credits to another alliance."

00:31 You say, "I wanted to try it out."

00:31 Lily Kaise says, "I mean stuff."

00:31 You say, "Nah, I didn't do it near that BAs."

00:31 Lily Kaise says, "So let's go build a bAS."

00:31 You say, "I did it near Steel Phoenix command."

00:32 Lily Kaise asks, "Does it have an FTL?"

00:32 You say, "So, I didn't give my credits to anyone."

00:32 You nod.

00:32 Lily Kaise says, "Oh heh."

00:32 You say, "It does."

00:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:32 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow nice!"

00:32 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow great charge too!"

00:32 You say, "Oh, I need to put an improved temp drive in here."

00:32 You grin.

00:32 Lily Kaise removes an improved temporary wormhole drive from a gold-toned engineering tool case.

00:32 Lily Kaise puts down an improved temporary wormhole drive.

00:33 You exclaim, "Oh, thanks!"

00:33 Lily Kaise carefully sets about bolting an improved temporary wormhole drive to a convenient surface.

00:33 Lily Kaise grins at you.

00:33 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:33 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:33 You say, "I coulod have crafted one."

00:33 You grin at Lily Kaise.

00:33 You say to Lily, "I think you should apply."

00:33 You smile at Lily Kaise.

00:34 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:34 Lily Kaise says, "Well I am not so sure i'll be good at answering defense-related questions but yeah I would so love one and yeah I would probablyy try to fly it."

00:34 You say, "I still need to craft a couple of things for it, but yeah, I think you should at least try."

00:34 Your ship 'Defensive Dissidence' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:34 Lily Kaise says, "Wow the storage capacity is really nice."

00:34 You say, "Yeah, that was a nice surprise."

00:34 Lily Kaise says, "It's size isn't all that bad either."

00:35 You say, "Nope."

00:35 You smile.

00:35 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

00:35 You say, "Come sit."

00:35 You grin at Lily Kaise.

00:35 Lily Kaise says, "Oh my."

00:35 Lily Kaise says, "No salvaging tools though."

00:35 You say, "True."

00:35 You say, "But oh well."

00:36 You say, "I'll probably switch out the mini for torps."

00:36 Lily Kaise says, "Still, if you ever switched to a torp launcher, you have room for plenty of ammo."

00:36 You nod.

00:36 You say, "YEah, I probably will switch to a torp launcher."

00:36 Lily Kaise says, "Heh I wonder if it would carry trade goods."

00:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:36 You laugh.

00:36 Lily Kaise kisses you.

00:36 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:37 Lily says to you, "Congratulations!"

00:37 You say, "Well, I'm sure Ather was the first to get one, but I might have been the second."

00:37 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well had you put your app in you probably would have been. Still it's ok, you got one."

00:37 You nod.

00:37 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

00:37 You smile.

00:38 Lily Kaise says, "Ok want to go put a BAS together or do you want to wait."

00:38 You say, "I can probably help in about an hour or so to put it togehter."

00:38 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

00:38 You say, "Together."

00:39 Lily Kaise smiles.

00:39 You smile.

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:10 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

01:11 You say to Lily, "Ok. You want to go build that BAS?"

01:15 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah hang on."

01:15 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

01:16 Lily Kaise returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

01:16 You say, "No problem."

01:17 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

01:17 Lily Kaise stands up from a dark green leather captain's chair.

01:17 You smile.

01:17 You stand up from a dark green leather captain's chair.

01:17 Lily Kaise is already a member of Shule Elemmire's group.

01:17 You disband your group.

01:17 You join Lily Kaise's group.

01:17 Lily Kaise says, "Well we could go in this I guess we're just picking up the module transport."

01:17 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:17 You say, "Oh."

01:17 You grin.

01:17 Lily Kaise says, "Or your flare."

01:17 You ask, "Where?"

01:18 Lily Kaise says, "New earth as it's there."

01:18 You say, "Ok."

01:18 Lily Kaise says, "There."

01:18 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

01:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:18 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

01:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Defensive Dissidence, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:18 Lily Kaise says, "I keep it there for tactical purposes."

01:18 The ship is already moving.

01:18 The ship is already moving.

01:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:18 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:18 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:18 You grin.

01:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:18 Lily Kaise says, "I may put it on Steel Command just haven't decided."

01:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:18 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:18 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:18 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Defensive Dissidence! Welcome to home space!"

01:18 Lily Kaise says, "Maybe might get one for the org."

01:18 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

01:18 --
AutoStar (general-purpose starship autopilot) Version 9.1
--
Destinations in this sector:

   Planets:
[1] New Earth                                               
   Space Stations:

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:18 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

01:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:18 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Defensive Dissidence. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:19 You stand up from a dark green leather captain's chair.

01:19 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:19 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

01:19 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go down and out.

01:19 Lily Kaise says, "Ok it's herding cats."

01:19 You follow Lily Kaise out.

01:19 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Airlock]
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:19 You nod.

01:19 You follow Lily Kaise out of the ship.

01:19 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go up.

01:19 Your ship 'Defensive Dissidence' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:19 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:19 You follow Lily Kaise aboard the four-person space constructor "Herding Cats".

01:19 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:19 You follow Lily Kaise into the ship.

01:19 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch, and an early warning space defense device here.
Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

01:20 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

01:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:20 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Herding Cats, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:20 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:20 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Steel Phoenix Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Steel Phoenix Command."

01:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:20 The unusual but striking shape of the Steel Phoenix Command Station floats here, a large structure of darkened steel.

01:20 Via general sector communication, Steel Phoenix Command transmits, "Hello there, Herding Cats! Welcome to home space!"

01:20 Lily Kaise says, "I am so glad we can convert megacredits."

01:20 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:20 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Steel Phoenix Command (Dock Alpha).

01:20 You exclaim, "Me too!"

01:21 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:21 Lily Kaise says, "That was my only concern in all this but I figured we'd manage because ifever we ran out, we could just purchase modules outright."

01:21 You nod.

01:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:21 You smile.

01:21 You're already standing.

01:21 A voice says over the speaker, "The Steel Phoenix rises. Cleared to land."

01:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:21 Lily Kaise says, "Members couldn't though."

01:21 You nod.

01:21 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:21 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

01:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:44 You glance at your communicator's screen.

15:44 Notice from Lily Kaise on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Greetings SEAS! We have sponsored 3 income-producing Temporary Space Stations. These Temporary Space Space stations are -- a BAS in the sector West of Steel Phoenix Command, a Salvage Processor in the Sector just East of Steel Phoenix Command and a Xenology Scanner which is just east of the Steel Phoenix Command Sector. Please inform new AEU pilots on how to navigate to these stations as they will benefit from earning more income from their work as they pay less taxes on their income for utilizing a Temporary Space Station. Hence, this shows the abject ignorance of the League Alliance regarding not wanting the AEU to benefit. It is moreso that they want to punish AEU pilots for what the Worst administration has done. Unfortunately, I couldn't obtain approval to utilize jointly contributed modules from SEAS and Starseekers and Invaders did not respond to at least three separate invitations to participate. Hopefully over time they will want to participate as I don't feel comfortable with these stations being sponsored soley on behalf of SEAS. Another exciting development is SEAS can now convert Credits to Megacredits. So as long as we have Credits to convert to Megacredits, we can continue to contribute to Temporary Space Stations or build them on our own. Fly safe! And fight hard on the ground!

18:11 a Tardick lizard named Asteria

18:11 This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

18:32 [Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, a bright orange crate, and a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow.
You can go up and out.
