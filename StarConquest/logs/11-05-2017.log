00:21 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

00:31 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

00:41 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

00:46 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "How do I use a temporary wormhole drive?"

00:46 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Bolt it down in your control room."

00:46 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Bolt it in your engineering room then jump."

00:46 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or engineering room, if your ship has one of those."

00:46 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Thank you."

00:48 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "If you have several jumps to make, you might use a temp wormhole drive every jump."

00:48 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Your best plan is to jump to a main sector like Earthgate or Providence Gate, etc."

00:48 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Those sectors will usually have repair centers, which you can stop and have your drive fixed at."

00:49 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. I believe the ones purchased at stores and the first tier one on workbenches only do one jump per drive. But it's been awhile since I've used one."

00:50 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I think the first tier workbench one does two, but don't quote me on it. You're right about the store bought ones though."

00:50 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, that's quite possible. The improved are four I believe."

00:50 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They are."

00:51 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

00:55 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

00:55 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

01:03 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whaaat, the rundown and movelist display chunks in the same order?"

01:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not the movelist."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Damn, I've been doing the math this whole time."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The rundown and the debris scanner."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The debris list from the scanner, I thought you meant."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow, that's great to know."

01:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The movelist only shows the closest debris."

01:04 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "There's actually an option to have it show everything, Morris, last I checked. It's just very spammy."

01:04 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh yeah. There is. I didn't think anyone used that. Heh."

01:04 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I turned it on for all of 10 seconds once..."

01:07 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "If I see 26 of something, can I get 10 or them?"

01:07 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not of not disassembled components, no."

01:07 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Uh...are you talking workbench?"

01:08 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If they're already on your workbench, it'll pop up with a menu and you can pick how many you want to take."

01:08 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok."

01:11 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Is there a way to see what the weapons of the battle suits do before you buy them? I got the pistle and the hand grenades but was tempted to buy the mistle. The pain!"

01:11 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Other pilots would know and be able to answer questions about them."

01:18 The bubbles begin rising more quickly from the large plastic treasure chest.

01:28 The large goldfish floats nearby, its large mouth rhythmically opening and closing. It then abruptly swims off.

01:39 The large goldfish idly swims with disinterest.

01:48 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:55 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:55 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:55 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:55 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

01:56 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

01:56 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

01:57 Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.

01:57 The heat lessens just slightly.

01:57 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

01:59 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "How do you turn the pa locked on or off?"

01:59 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Pa on, or pa off."

01:59 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Pa on and pa off."

01:59 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It shows in the room description, so you don't get caught off guard."

02:01 Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.

02:02 The heat lessens just slightly.

02:04 Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.

02:04 The heat lessens just slightly.

02:08 Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.

02:08 The heat lessens just slightly.

02:18 Flames flicker on either side of the conveyor belt as the air grows hot.

02:19 The heat lessens just slightly.

02:25 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

02:36 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

02:47 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

02:57 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

02:57 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

03:12 You stand up from an insulated red sleeping bag.

03:12 You remove a small suitcase from a leather briefcase.

03:12 You open a small suitcase.

03:13 You remove a pair of white cotton briefs from a small suitcase.

03:13 You're already wearing something like that.

03:13 You remove all of your clothing, placing it carefully in a small suitcase.

03:13 You slide a pair of white cotton briefs on.

03:13 You remove a dark blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs from a small suitcase.

03:13 You step into a dark blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and pull it over your arms.

03:13 You slide a pair of white socks onto your feet.

03:13 You remove a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers from a small suitcase.

03:14 You close a small suitcase.

03:14 You pull a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers onto your feet.

03:14 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Block]

03:14 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a large leather couch, and Alexay the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

03:14 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Main Deck]

03:14 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Allied Libertarians", a large leather couch, a mahogany coffee table, and a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

03:14 You peer north...

03:14 
[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, a compact white refrigerator, a black plastic trash can, a sheet of pink paper, an elegant crystal decanter, and Raiatea the arachnoid security robot here.
Melinda Michaels is standing here. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large leather couch. Johann Schraft is sitting on a black leather captain's chair.
You can go south and out.

Melinda Michaels is standing here. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large leather couch. Johann Schraft is sitting on a black leather captain's chair.
You can go south and out.

03:14 You sit down on a large leather couch.

03:14 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey."

03:14 You wave.

03:14 You say, "Hi everyone."

03:14 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:14 Lily says to you, "Hey Love!"

03:14 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Hello!"

03:14 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:14 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Anyone know the command to get the pod to drop a charge?"

03:14 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:14 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Contact."

03:15 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:15 I don't understand that.

03:15 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:16 Lily says to you, "You seem to always show up at the most opportunistic times!"

03:16 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:16 You ask, "Oh?"

03:16 You laugh.

03:17 You ask, "Oh wow. Is that the Andy's hypercast?"

03:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

03:17 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah we'll ned to charge soonish and then of course land on Andies to repair the Blast Chamber and time enough for a brew and a meat dog."

03:17 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Indeed!"

03:17 You say, "Oh wow."

03:17 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:17 You say, "Heh, guess it is good timing."

03:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Otherwise we're going to have to charge around noon and, that's not a popular time."

03:17 Johann Schraft asks, "Mel, in case you're sleeping after we charge, what's the heading we need?"

03:17 Johann Schraft says, "From andy's that is."

03:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Just go 270 negative 2."

03:18 Johann Schraft nods.

03:19 Melinda Michaels says, "So I'll try to chart at 20 LTC's out to get us sorted."

03:19 You say, "Ok."

03:19 Johann Schraft nods.

03:19 Johann Schraft says, "No hurry."

03:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Depending on flow, we may end up charging once more."

03:19 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that should be after most of us have slept for a bit."

03:20 You nod.

03:22 Lily Kaise applauds sedately.

03:23 Lily Kaise grins.

03:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:27 You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.

03:33 Melinda Michaels says, "NDB 2%."

03:33 Melinda Michaels activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

03:33 The background thrum of the ship's engines turns up an octave as it moves under emergency boost.

03:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:42 Lily Kaise says, "Wow I've had Asteria I guess it's nearly two years."

03:42 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:44 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

03:45 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Nice!"

03:46 Lily Kaise smiles and nods.

03:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:54 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

03:54 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

03:55 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:55 Aisling the Fox sits down on a large leather couch.

03:55 Aisling the Fox waves.

03:55 Lily Kaise waves.

03:55 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Hi aisling!"

03:55 Melinda Michaels waves.

03:55 Aisling the Fox says, "Hello hello."

03:57 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey."

03:58 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

03:58 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

03:59 Aisling the Fox says, "Halloo."

04:00 Aisling the Fox stands up from a large leather couch.

04:00 Aisling the Fox prances south.

04:00 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:00 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

04:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:10 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 544490926 at South and Very Slightly Down: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"

04:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:17 Aisling the Fox activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

04:17 Aisling the Fox ducks under the arm of Johann Schraft as she checks the long range scanner controls.

04:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Damn."

04:17 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

04:17 Melinda Michaels says, "Gonna slow down if we go southsoutheast."

04:17 Melinda Michaels frowns.

04:18 Johann Schraft says, "Well, we either turn now or we turn later and go slower."

04:18 Melinda Michaels struggles to see around Aisling the Fox as she works with the rift drive controls.

04:18 Melinda Michaels quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 283.0, -3.0.
The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

04:18 Aisling the Fox says, "Bonk."

04:18 Melinda Michaels says, "We could try something."

04:18 Johann Schraft asks, "What do you have in mind?"

04:18 Johann Schraft asks, "Going until they're east then shooting over?"

04:19 Melinda Michaels says, "More down to get rid of the elevation, see if that will speed us up a little."

04:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Or east."

04:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Either may work."

04:19 Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

04:19 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

04:19 Johann Schraft says, "Or that works."

04:19 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I was thinking going as far south and then east."

04:19 Melinda Michaels asks, "Try east?"

04:19 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah."

04:20 Lily Kaise says, "Well I wasn't suggesting Eastward or coreward until we're right adjacent."

04:20 Johann Schraft says, "Say Yeah, I'd go until the hypercast shows east."

04:20 Lily Kaise exclaims, "You guys decide! I'm here for the ride!"

04:20 Lily Kaise grins.

04:20 Johann Schraft grins.

04:21 Melinda Michaels nods to Johann Schraft. "Go ahead."

04:21 Johann Schraft nods.

04:21 Johann Schraft activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

04:21 Johann Schraft accidentally slams his shoulder into Shule Elemmire as he attempts to work with the long range scanner controls.
(14 seconds roundtime.)

04:21 Johann Schraft carefully turns a few small knobs on the broadcaster control board.

04:21 A number flap display rapidly flips around to indicate that the broadcaster is now aimed at 20.0, -5.0.

04:21 You grin.

04:21 You're already sitting.

04:21 You say, "Sorry, didn't mean to be in the way."

04:21 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Nothing like being shoulder to shoulder!"

04:21 Lily Kaise grins.

04:22 Johann Schraft says into the hypercaster microphone, "We are going until the hypercast is East, then shooting over, hopefully it's quicker than turning more into the flow."

04:22 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:22 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 544490926 at Southsoutheast and Very Slightly Down: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"

04:23 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Aisling the Fox's neck.

04:35 A Tardick lizard named Thor curls its tail loosely around Aisling the Fox's neck.

04:39 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

05:00 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

05:01 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

05:01 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

05:02 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "I ain't seen that pre-stellar yet. What's y'all's plans?"

05:02 Johann Schraft activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

05:02 Johann Schraft accidentally slams his shoulder into Shule Elemmire as he attempts to work with the long range scanner controls.
(15 seconds roundtime.)

05:02 Johann Schraft carefully turns a few small knobs on the broadcaster control board.

05:02 A number flap display rapidly flips around to indicate that the broadcaster is now aimed at 20.0, -50.0.

05:02 The room grows a bit more chill.

05:03 Johann Schraft says into the hypercaster microphone, "It's right near Andy's, like within a few lightyears."

05:03 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "Yeah, I thought it was to the north though, and we're an LTC outta Andy's now."

05:04 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "Well, ours do too, but I also don't recall seein it when we were in the galleon."

05:04 Melinda Michaels shrugs. "If we don't see it, we can just park and rest."

05:04 Melinda Michaels says, "No biggie."

05:04 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 544490926 at Southsoutheast and Very Slightly Down: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"

05:04 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "My carrier's sensors are crappier'n these and pretty sure it woulda seen it by now, but could be wrong."

05:05 Melinda Michaels says, "I think he is wrong."

05:05 Johann Schraft says, "I do too."

05:05 Melinda Michaels says, "But we'll find out."

05:05 Johann Schraft says into the hypercaster microphone, "Worst case, we use the furnace as much as we can, repair the furnace, then stop at the next prestellar we see."

05:05 Lily Kaise nods.

05:05 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "Yep. Either that or set down and charge overnight at Andy's."

05:06 Ted Warburton wanders in from the south.

05:06 Ted Warburton waves.

05:06 Johann Schraft says into the hypercaster microphone, "I would prefer to avoid that if at all possible. They charge pretty slowly."

05:06 Ted Warburton says, "Hey."

05:06 I don't understand that.

05:06 Lily says to Ted, "Hi."

05:06 Johann Schraft nods to Ted Warburton.

05:06 You wave to Ted Warburton.

05:06 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "They sure nuff do. Well...if we get real close to Andy's without seein it, whaddya wanna do?"

05:07 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah surprised we haven't seen either the oort or the pre-stellar."

05:07 Johann Schraft says into the hypercaster microphone, "We'll let you know."

05:07 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll just use the furnace and continue on."

05:07 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "Sounds good. Am I clear, by the way?"

05:07 Melinda Michaels says, "It's not imparative that we repair it, just a good idea."

05:07 Johann Schraft says, "I thought I said that."

05:07 Lily Kaise says, "But yeah these sensors won't see much until we're within a few light-years."

05:07 Johann Schraft nods.

05:07 Melinda says to Johann, "You did."

05:08 Ted Warburton asks, "Have we not even seen the hypercast from Andy's?"

05:08 Lily Kaise says, "Yes we have."

05:08 Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "You are clear."

05:08 You nod.

05:08 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 248046642 at Eastnortheast and Down: "Awesome. You're a lil staticky but I can understand ya alright."

05:08 Lily Kaise says, "We were discussing the pre-stellar and the oort that are close by to Andy's."

05:08 Melinda Michaels says, "Morris is just being, Morris."

05:08 Lily Kaise says, "Heh of course."

05:08 Lily Kaise says, "Morese the horse's."

05:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:10 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 544490926 at Southsoutheast and Very Slightly Down: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"

05:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:25 Ted Warburton finishes off a cup of freshly brewed coffee with cream and sugar.

05:25 Ted Warburton puts a cup in a black plastic trash can.

05:28 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 544490926 at Southsoutheast and Slightly Down: "Halloo all travelers! Please to visit Famous Andy's Trading Post! Purchase fine imported items from alliances! Resupply! Rest a while!"

05:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Ah."

05:29 Johann Schraft struggles to see around Melinda Michaels as he works with the rift drive controls.

05:29 Johann Schraft quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 270.0, -25.0.

05:29 The room grows a bit more chill.

05:30 The room grows a bit more chill.

05:32 Melinda Michaels says, "We probably need to clear out when we get closer so he can get us in easier. It's a little bit crowded."

05:32 You nod.

05:32 You stand up from a large leather couch.

05:39 You lie down on a narrow bunk.

05:41 You hear what sounds like voices in another part of the ship, but you don't recognize them and you can't hear what they're saying.

05:42 You blink heavily and then doze off.

05:42 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anything?"

05:43 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nothing yet.rift loc."

05:47 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

05:47 The room grows a bit warmer.

05:48 The room grows a bit more chill.

05:58 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

06:02 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

06:02 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

06:11 You venture through a side door.

06:11 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

06:43 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of soft white slippers off of her feet.

06:43 Lily Kaise puts down a pair of soft white slippers.

07:02 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

07:03 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

07:03 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

07:03 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

07:08 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

07:08 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

07:33 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

07:33 In the vast black emptiness of space, a tiny speck in the dark can be seen: A small space station, glinting in the eons-old reflected starlight.  Mostly docking bay, the living areas are almost hidden underneath the large boxy construct, while fortified chaingun emplacements and large communication arrays appear to dot almost every surface of the mismatched steel plating.

07:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

07:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

07:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

07:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

07:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:34 The computer announces, "Artificial gravity systems offline."

07:34 The computer announces, "Communications systems offline."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

12:20 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Three]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Famous Andy's Trading Post; Docking Bay.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, a small red insulated cooler, a small purple trash bin, and a pair of soft white slippers here.

13:01 [Newbie Help] Brad Pinkett transmits, "Damn. Its going through a rift too, so that's gonna take a while."

15:21 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "I belive use kit."

15:21 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Or use shav."

17:08 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "How do you warn a ship?"

17:08 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's one of the options when you type gen in a ship control room. You can do gento to direct it at a particular ship."

17:08 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sector general communication. In your control room, type general (or gen) and choose it from the list."

17:09 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I see!"

18:03 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Can I put more than one scoop on my ship somehow?"

18:04 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Type scoop on a landing pad and you'll be able to transfer other people's scoops onto your ship."

18:04 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If I'm understanding your question correctly."

18:04 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Thanks, that's what I meant."

18:08 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "So, when I go scooping, I can bring somebody else with me and we can both launch our scoops? That question make sense?"

18:09 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes. Use MOVESCOOP."

18:09 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."

18:09 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Put the two scoops on the same ship, and when you use scoop aboard the ship, you will each be put into your respective scoops."

18:09 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Excellent!"

18:09 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just be sure both of you can scoop at the particular gas giant in question."

18:10 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh, that is a consideration?"

18:10 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes."

18:10 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If your partner can scoop at Saturn, and you only have the points for Jupiter, you won't be able to scoop at Saturn because you're with this new partner."

18:10 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How do I know what I can scoop at?"

18:11 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You probably have a book with a page that lists it."

18:11 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Hmm, not on me, don't recall ever seeing one in a bookstore either. Hmm."

18:12 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's by my character, if that helps. A book about industry."

18:12 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh, yes I do have that."

18:19 The computer announces, "Initializing startup procedures for sensors systems."

18:19 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:20 The computer announces, "Aborted sensors startup procedure."

18:20 The computer announces, "Initializing startup procedures for navigation systems."

18:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:21 The computer announces, "Aborted navigation startup procedure."

18:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:22 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Testing."

18:23 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Works!"

18:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:23 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If you're not here, sucks to be you."

18:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:23 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

18:24 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

18:24 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

18:24 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

18:26 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

18:35 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "As an AEU alliance member, would it be stupid to ask over general for help to get into mutuality space to do someone a favor?"

18:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

18:35 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Shweet."

18:54 The hovertrailer carrying you fishtails briefly.

19:04 A sudden shift in gravity pulls you down as the hovertruck rises into the air to travel over a perpendicular highway.

19:10 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

19:20 An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

19:26 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

19:26 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

19:55 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

20:06 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

20:16 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

20:17 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Are we allowed to refer to the who list in character?"

20:17 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Same goes for the where command."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And how do I refer to it IC."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Looking at your comm."

20:18 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Gotcha."

20:26 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

20:27 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

20:27 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

20:39 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

20:57 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

21:08 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

21:18 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

21:18 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Katie if you're still on, the who command references your communicator, so my assumption would be that in character, our communicators can show us who's connected and detected presently."

21:18 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Yep. Thanks for that."

21:19 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The comm description also references a list of names."

21:19 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you look at your communicat...uh...what Erik said."

21:19 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Incidentally, that's how titles would be IC."

21:19 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Exactly."

21:19 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "That and, supposedly, the name of speakers is displayed textually."

21:20 The flock seems to be gradually losing altitude with no updraft beneath it.

21:28 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

21:28 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

21:57 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

22:07 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

22:17 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

22:28 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

22:29 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

22:31 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

22:31 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

22:56 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How did you do that sallery thing erik?"

22:56 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Spell it correctly and that's the command."

22:56 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The salary command."

22:59 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

22:59 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Is there a way to turn off wen you are in a room and people speak into there com units?"

22:59 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No."

22:59 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."

22:59 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They're talking. Just like someone talking on a phone, you can hear them."

22:59 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If you can't see the channel they're talking on, you'll see what they say into them."

23:00 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I'm trying to play with this salary thing now, when I type salary it says type alary <player> to add somebody to my salary list, when I type salary erik, it says I don't see that here."

23:00 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's a bit finicky."

23:00 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sometimes you have to use full first and last name."

23:00 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "He has to be in the room. Also, try his full name."

23:00 [Newbie Help] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's pretty old code. I don't even know if the hosts have updated it since new SC."

23:01 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh got it."

23:01 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is more than one character that spells their name E-r-i-k."

23:01 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And to think I spelled it like that to be unique, even though it made little sense."

23:02 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's uncommon but certainly not unique. Maybe with a Q it would have been..."

23:02 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How do I remove erik from my salary now?"

23:02 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's not the tipical merican spelling, which is why I figured. Anyways."

23:02 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Salary <person> again."

23:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Both the ones I know that spell it that way are 'mericans."

23:03 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh, the only person I know who spells it with a k is from...I actually don't remember where."

23:09 Bubbles carelessly float up from a large plastic treasure chest.

23:20 A small snail glides effortlessly across the inner surface of the glass.

23:27 The bubbles rising from the large plastic treasure chest become less frequent.

23:32 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. When it empties, you find yourself back in the starship.

23:32 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

23:52 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I suppose you coulld expell your ammo box and buy a new box and fill it properly, otherwise I don't know."

23:53 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "That'd work."

23:54 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
