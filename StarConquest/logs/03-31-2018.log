-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

01:58 Ryan Thomas says, "Think we lsot it this time."

02:02 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:02 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

02:02 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:02 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:02 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:05 Lily Kaise stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:05 Lily Kaise sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:09 On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls from the sky.

02:11 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Where's the nebula..."

02:11 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm not sure."

02:11 Hawthorn Dunn says, "The hell..."

02:11 Hawthorn Dunn sighs.

02:11 Hawthorn Dunn ambles north.

02:11 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Paranoid, I tell you."

02:12 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay we're at 33 percent on the beacons again."

02:12 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Yay."

02:13 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please, let things be normal for a while. Please rift, be nice."

02:13 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

02:13 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I ate the nebula."

02:13 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Tasty."

02:13 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "You must be full now."

02:13 Lily Kaise gasps at you.

02:13 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Probably hit his stomach like a rock!"

02:13 Lily Kaise laughs.

02:13 You laugh.

02:14 You say to Clarina, "Nope, I'm still hungry."

02:14 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Drink some water. You'll feel full. As my mother always said."

02:20 The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.

02:21 Lily shields her eyes.

02:21 Lily Kaise says, "That's just... horrible and unthinkable."

02:22 You nod to Lily Kaise.

02:30 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

02:33 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

02:38 Clarina Taylor scrambles to her feet.

02:38 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

02:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

02:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

02:41 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

02:41 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

02:42 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Phew make this go away!"

02:42 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

02:42 Clarina Taylor sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:42 Clarina Taylor stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

02:42 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

02:42 You say to Lily, "I don't like this one all that much better."

02:42 Lily Kaise says, "Well it's part of the saga."

02:43 You say, "True."

02:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

03:01 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

03:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:11 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

03:12 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh hell no."

03:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:19 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

03:19 Hawthorn Dunn ambles north.

03:20 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So our charge is almost at 40 percent."

03:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:29 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

03:33 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

03:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:42 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

03:42 Clarina Taylor places Ryan Thomas on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

03:42 Clarina Taylor sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

03:42 You smile at Clarina Taylor.

03:42 Lily Kaise smiles at Clarina Taylor.

03:42 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

03:42 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

03:42 Clarina Taylor smiles.

03:43 Lily Kaise says, "Wow what a contrast..."

03:45 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

03:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:54 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

03:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:03 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

04:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:12 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

04:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:21 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

04:27 Clarina Taylor scrambles to her feet.

04:27 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

04:27 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

04:27 Clarina Taylor sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

04:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

04:31 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

04:32 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

04:35 Clarina Taylor scrambles to her feet.

04:35 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

04:35 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

04:36 Clarina Taylor sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

04:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:42 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

04:43 Lily Kaise smiles.

04:46 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

04:46 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

04:48 Clarina Taylor says, "Pretty fish."

04:48 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

04:48 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So when are we going to stop to charge?"

04:48 You grin.

04:48 Ryan Thomas says, "Pretty plannet."

04:48 Clarina Taylor yawns.

04:48 Clarina Taylor says, "Lavender sky."

04:48 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I really liked that blue one which swam beside us but I love them all!"

04:48 You smile.

04:49 I don't understand that.

04:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:53 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that's a rift stat."

04:53 Lily Kaise blinks.

04:54 Lily Kaise stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

04:54 Lily Kaise glides north.

04:55 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

04:55 Lily Kaise sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

04:55 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

05:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

05:07 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

05:07 Hawthorn Dunn ambles west.

05:12 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Next prestellar or nebula or etcetera."

05:12 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay!"

05:16 A reptilian-like creature flies overhead, producing a melodic trill as it passes.

05:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:23 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I'm off to bed. Rest well all when the time comes."

05:23 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:23 You stand up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

05:23 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:23 You pull a pair of gray canvas sneakers off of your feet.

05:24 You open a small suitcase for a moment.

05:24 You remove a small suitcase from a leather briefcase for a moment.
You put a pair of gray canvas sneakers in a small suitcase.

05:24 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Same here! Fly safe! And will see you all in about a cycle and a half or two."

05:24 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

05:24 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:24 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:24 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes off of her feet.

05:24 Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

05:29 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

05:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:40 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

05:46 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

05:46 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

05:47 I don't see that here.

05:47 I don't understand that.

05:48 You say to Lily, "Night my love. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:49 Lily says to you, "Nite love. Rest well ans sweet dreams. I love you."

06:29 You venture through a side door.

06:29 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

06:30 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

06:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:40 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

06:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:49 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

06:49 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

06:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

07:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

07:44 The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.

07:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:51 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

07:51 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

07:54 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Fuckkkkkkkk thissssssss riftscapeeeeeeee."

07:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

08:02 The mortar crew launch a volley of shells into enemy territory, scoring direct hits.

08:07 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's hte amter keegan?"

08:07 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's the matter keegan."

08:08 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Asked Tony if anything's wrong because he's been pretty inactive, and he went back to Observation and passed out."

08:08 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he chuckles.

08:08 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh."

08:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:21 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

08:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:24 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please don't shoot us."

08:27 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

08:27 Enemy gunfire intensifies and the soldiers in the trench hunker down for protection.

08:28 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

08:37 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:37 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

08:37 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:37 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

08:39 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Keegan did you see the travel distance?"

08:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:40 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

08:46 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No."

08:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:26 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

09:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:37 A gentle breeze rustles through the grass, causing ripple-like waves.

09:39 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

09:39 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

09:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:49 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

10:40 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

10:40 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

10:40 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

10:48 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hmmm."

10:48 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Spotted this from very far out."

10:48 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

10:48 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

10:48 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Are we going for it?"

10:48 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

10:48 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes, but I'm not expecting to need to image it."

10:49 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I was under the impression we'd offset our course again if we find too many already discovered things."

10:49 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Indeed, but we don't know if it's already discovered or not."

10:49 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

10:49 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The last thing we saw was mid-storm."

10:50 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

10:51 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Still a good bit of distance off."

11:10 The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul screaming within.

11:14 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:25 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

11:33 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

11:33 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:34 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:41 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

11:41 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

11:41 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The rift likes to eat tactical platforms."

11:43 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:43 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:44 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:44 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:45 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

11:45 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:46 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:47 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

11:53 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aye, nice and delicious."

11:54 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

11:54 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

11:55 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

12:02 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

12:08 The tunnel around the ship shudders, contracts, and begins pushing the ship in the opposite direction.

12:08 With a loud gurgle, the ship begins picking up speed in its progress through the tunnel.

12:09 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

12:09 Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:09 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

12:11 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

12:24 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

12:25 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

12:25 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

12:25 The starship has left a unique area of space.

12:25 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
