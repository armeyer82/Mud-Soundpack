00:23:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:23:15 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

00:23:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:23:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:23:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:48:14 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

00:48:19 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

00:48:21 [General Communication] Jason Rat transmits, "How many do you need?"

00:48:24 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of neutronium.

00:48:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Just a couple. But if you intend to vacation or something, a couple more."

03:27:08     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *

03:27:08 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
Lileah Rose (sitting on a large leather lounge couch) is here.
You can go south and out.

03:27:14 You kiss Lileah Rose.

03:27:16 Lileah Rose kisses you.

03:27:21 You say to Lileah Rose, "Hi love"

03:27:21 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

03:27:27 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

03:27:54 Lileah Rose pulls a large lever towards her.

03:27:54 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:28:00 Lileah Rose grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:28:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:28:13 You grin.

03:28:17 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:28:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:28:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:28:24 Lileah Rose chuckles.

03:28:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:28:38 You say, "I have no idea where the Jinu ship is."

03:28:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

03:28:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:28:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:28:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:29:01 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

03:29:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:29:13 There is nothing in the storage hold.

03:29:13 Storage capacity: 200000 units

03:29:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:29:41 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

03:29:45 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

03:29:50 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an abandoned storage pod.

03:34:55 You grin.

03:34:58 You say, "That's fine."

03:35:02 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

03:35:28 Lileah Rose says, "also Sector sometimes has bigger pieces but you know that the smaller ones are worth more."

03:35:33 You say, "Yeah, when salvaging, it's easier."

03:35:34 Lileah Rose says, "sector 15"

03:35:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:35:38 You say, "ah, ok"

04:27:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:27:16 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

04:27:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:27:28 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

04:27:33 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

04:27:38 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of frozen hydrogen.

13:41:21 You peer out...

13:41:21 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

13:41:30 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:41:30 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:41:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:41:33 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:42:04 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

14:37:25 Announcement: For clarification: a particular ship's color scheme was a minor error that has been fixed.

14:38:10 [MTTS] kaite: Wow well it certainly stirred up some nice drama here darn.

14:38:23 [MTTS] davetaylor: Didn't it just.

14:38:42 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yeah, sorry about that. It was a quirk of how it got generated but it should now have the correct color scheme.

14:38:59 [MTTS] kaite: Thanks.

14:39:11 [MTTS] alc_71: Thanks for fixing and clarifying but the drama was fun.

14:39:32 [MTTS] Squidmind: IC drama is great!

14:39:44 [MTTS] alc_71: It sure is.

14:39:57 [MTTS] kaite: 'Suspense'!

14:40:00 [MTTS] davetaylor: What a storyline that could have made.

14:53:17     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *

14:53:17 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, a cedar dresser, a satin bra, a black stretchy tanktop with tiny butterfly embroidery on the top front, a pair of skimpy pink lace bikini cut panties, a pair of denim bellbottoms, a pair of star print wooden clogs, a plaid button down shirt, a pair of cotton briefs, a pair of black corduroy jeans, and some black leather boots here.
Lileah Rose (staring into space) (lying on a walnut canopy bed) is here.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a walnut canopy bed.)

14:53:24 You kiss Lileah Rose.

14:53:27 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

14:53:28 Lileah Rose kisses you.

14:53:38 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

14:53:42 You kiss Lileah Rose on the smooth skin above her breasts.

14:53:49 You say to Lileah Rose, "Hi love."

14:53:52 Lileah Rose leans close to you and kisses you softly on the chest.

14:54:03 Lileah Rose says to you, "good day Love."

14:54:08 You smile.

14:54:15 You kiss Lileah Rose on one of her breasts.

14:58:35 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

14:58:46 You smile at Lileah Rose.

14:58:53 You gently caress Lileah Rose's back.

14:59:10 Lileah Rose gently caresses your neck and shoulders.

14:59:39 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

14:59:44 You say to Lileah Rose, "I love you"

15:00:25 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

15:00:32 Lileah Rose says to you, "i love you too!"

15:00:36 You kiss Lileah Rose on one of her breasts.

15:00:47 Lileah Rose squeezes you affectionately.

15:00:54 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

15:01:55 Lileah Rose says, "It is so wonderful waking up beside you. I still remember that desolation out there. I was the only human out there amongst aliens who I couldn't figure out how to communicate with."

15:02:11 You say, "Awww, It's so nice waking up next to you."

15:02:23 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

15:02:28 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

15:02:41 You smooch Lileah Rose.

15:02:47 Lileah Rose grins at you.

15:02:52 Lileah Rose smooches you.

15:04:16 You grin.

15:05:11 You kiss Lileah Rose softly on the stomach.

15:06:26 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

15:06:32 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

15:10:16 You say to Lileah Rose, "I'm still surprised you never found anyone during the last four years. I'm sure there were those who were attracted to you."

15:11:00 Lileah Rose says, "i don't know. the Pilot alliances are very inactive these days."

15:11:12 Lileah Rose says, "I rarely see anyone at work."

15:11:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:11:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:11:24 There appear to be about 9 pilots recently active.

15:11:25 The communicator network and Accord QE comm detect:
Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident  (A) [m]
%Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident  (A)
%Angel Martin  (A)
%Katina Faye  (L)
%Alko Delovega  (F)
%Nathaniel Owens  (F)
%Ted Warburton  (F)

% == Detected via Quantum Entanglement comm
Your communicator also reports that there are 8 pilots who were active but dropped out of communications.
Additionally, there are 18 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but have not recently been active.
Final total: 27 pilots.

15:11:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:11:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:11:36 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:11:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:11:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:11:50 The ship is already moving.

15:11:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:11:52 Which sector did you mean?

15:11:52 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

15:11:53 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:11:54 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:11:54 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

15:11:57 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:11:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:12:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:12:01 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:12:01 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

15:12:02 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:12:04 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:12:05 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:12:05 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:12:08 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

15:12:13 Lileah Rose says, "we had a few when I first got out of the academy but i'm not sure where they went. Some were more advanced so perhaps they're off exploring or assigned to specitl projects. it's a mystery to me."

15:12:16 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

15:12:17 --
AutoStar (general-purpose starship autopilot) Version 9.1

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:12:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

15:12:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:12:46 You nod to Lileah Rose.

15:13:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:13:02 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:13:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:13:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:13:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:13:22 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:13:23 Lileah Rose glances down at her watch momentarily.

15:13:26 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:13:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:13:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:13:38 The ship is already moving.

15:13:40 The ship is already moving.

15:13:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:13:42 Which sector did you mean?

15:13:42 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

15:13:44 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:13:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:13:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

15:13:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:13:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:13:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:13:51 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: \DnyJ]8zU:>6$"YEg_'~<bdFS?RQKETWhZhO(S.M
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:13:52 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

15:13:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:13:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:13:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:13:57 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:13:57 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

15:13:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:14:01 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:14:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:14:02 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:14:02 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

15:14:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:14:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:14:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:14:07 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:14:09 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

15:14:12 There are no other ships in the sector.

15:14:16 Which sector did you mean?

15:14:16 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

15:14:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:14:29 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

15:14:32 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

15:14:35 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

15:14:53 You say, "Well, one good thing is that at least for now, I don't have much compatition when it comes to you."

15:14:59 I can't find "lileha."

15:14:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:15:00 Lileah Rose grins.

15:15:02 You grin at Lileah Rose.

15:15:27 Lileah Rose says, "well don't worry about it. The guys i met were all a bit odd so."

15:15:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:15:28 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:15:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

15:15:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:15:39 You chuckle.

15:15:40 You say, "ok"

15:15:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:15:43 Lileah Rose chuckles.

15:15:45 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:15:45 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:17:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:18:00 You kiss Lileah Rose on the smooth skin above her breasts.

15:18:14 Lileah Rose leans close to you and kisses you softly on the chest.

15:25:35 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

15:25:48 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:25:48 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:25:49 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:25:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

15:25:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:26:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:26:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:26:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:26:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

15:26:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:26:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:26:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:26:35 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:26:40 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

15:27:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:27:20 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:27:20 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

15:27:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

15:27:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:27:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:27:40 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

15:28:56 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:24:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You would have been proud though, the wind was blowing right in my face the whole way back so I did some tacking."

18:25:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nice job."

18:31:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You got any of the repairs done yet? There's external ones and internal ones."

18:31:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just finished inside and started up on the external ones."

18:32:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wish I had brought my early warning device."

18:32:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though I guess I can check my navaid every now and again."

18:33:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You should be fine, it can't hurt to be safe, but there's not usually things lookin for trouble that far out."

18:33:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you were closer to Outsider space, or even closer to the beacon, I'd be more worried, but chances are slim that something will spot you and get to you before you can fix the drive."

18:34:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do you have a long-ranged scanner?"

18:35:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I'm not sure. The ship might, if that's something ships have."

18:35:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I don't have the points to buy one myself yet."

18:35:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, they have some built in stuff that will let you see the residual pings and such, but yeah you have to buy the scanner to be able to scan yourself."

18:36:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It shouldn't take you too much longer, I imagine."

18:36:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I think I've almost got it."

18:52:08 [MTTS] Ulias: Hahaha, foiled at every turn.

19:04:35 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Eli."

19:04:39 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Eli."

19:04:44 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Eli."

19:04:57 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Eli."

19:13:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you familar with the space-time anomaly about 5 light years out from b-24?"

19:14:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, You mean UKN1?"

19:14:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, maybe that's what it was."

19:15:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, familiar is probably not the word I would use, I've heard of it, yes."

19:15:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've never seen it myself, Ather could probably tell you more."

19:18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I noticed both going out and coming back that the ship drops out immediately if I hit my target close enough."

19:18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's pretty nice."

19:20:27 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 1,796,093.75 credits from a xenology submission.

19:22:05 [MTTS] Ulias: Oh support tickets, how Ilove thee.

19:22:30 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"

19:23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When you are coming into alliance sector beacons, they're often close enough together that you might get pulled into a different one than even the one you were aiming at, is that what you mean?"

19:23:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hm, maybe. But I also didn't need to tell the rift drive to stop when I reached the debris field."

19:24:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just dropped out when I got close."

19:24:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If You're trim is set low, and you leav from an alliance beacon, yeah, you will sometimes instantly get pulled into a different one."

19:24:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is there a beacon out there?"

19:24:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, yeah that's how it works. From my u nderstanding of it, the rift sorta pools around places like that and even pulls you slightly towards them when you start getting close. When you get close enough, it yanks you out all together."

19:25:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."

19:39:14 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Eli."

19:39:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."

19:39:38 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I need to speak to you."

19:39:53 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Old Earth."

19:39:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm coming. Your usual spot?"

19:39:59 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok."

19:45:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anyone for gunship beacons?"

19:45:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not right now, but maybe in about an hour or so."

20:05:20 [MTTS] Butchulla: The crafting system in this game is seriously second to none, it still amazes me now every time I use it. Have I ever mentioned you hosts rock?

20:06:20 [MTTS] Ulias: It really is boss.

20:23:30 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

20:47:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Huh. I can't find anybody that wants to buy these clothes. Feels like I've been to over a dozen planets already."

20:47:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Luxury clothes, eh?"

20:47:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can give you a clue!"

20:47:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll gladly take a clue."

20:47:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I just can't tell you where exactly."

20:48:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Check EAOS space."

20:48:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Alright, thanks. I'll continue exploring ports- but that'll narrow it down by a lot."

20:50:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Helios probably pays better for them, but well, last I knew, we can't trade to Mutuality ports anyway."

20:50:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You bought luxury clothing or standard clothing?"

20:51:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Luxury clothing."

20:54:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, it seems I was wrong! They don't buy it in EAOS space either."

20:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've already searched all of AEU and League. I didn't imagine it'd be so difficult to find a port willing to buy them."

20:55:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, most of the alliances already have access to luxury clothing and the like."

20:55:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "My advice honestly, is to first go around the various trading centers, and check their LIST of what they buy and sell. Then you can try experimenting with various trade routes."

20:56:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've been keeping record of the ports and what they buy and sell as I try to find someone to buy these clothes, to avoid a problem like this in the future."

20:56:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Good. Keep records."

20:58:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I have records of most of the trading centers, but not all."

20:58:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Makes thigns a lot easier, especially when we sometimes get special trade requests."

20:58:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That must've taken a good bit of time to put together."

20:58:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It did, to be sure."

20:59:10 Minor Change: Battlesuit DAMAGE/ENERGY commands as well as the aerial fortress DAMAGE command are now altered by the "no graphical ASCII" option.

20:59:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And it will probably require more work in future. I'd imagine in the future markets will start fluctuating more, add more items etc. So I'll have to run to all of them all over again."

20:59:56 [MTTS] usfolks: Thanks!

21:00:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But it's good to maintain trading records, even if you don't make it one of the things you do most commonly."

21:00:26 [MTTS] usfolks: Just curious, does it also get rid of all the extra lines?

21:01:15 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes.

21:01:16 [MTTS] atherj: For damage readouts, maybe. For everything else though, probably not. Like charge was still like 5 lines.

21:01:56 [MTTS] atherj: Oh, I like what you did with the systems command, very nice. It was still quite usable with the old method, but this is pretty neat.

21:01:57 [MTTS] ricolachen: It sends an extra 0 for damage/energy in the battlesuits.

21:02:05 [MTTS] Squidmind: There's a separate option to suppress lines of dashes, if that's what you're talking about.

21:02:26 [MTTS] usfolks: Thanks Squid. That'll make a huge difference. With all the extra lines it would fly past. And no, not the dashes, just the space taken up by the ASCII meter.

21:03:10 [MTTS] Squidmind: The battlesuit commands give the current level, the maximum level, and the percentage. So if you're undamaged, there should be a zero, your maximum damage number, then another zero.

21:03:45 [MTTS] ricolachen: It's like, Energy Level: 220/220 [100%]. Then another line, 0.

21:05:04 [MTTS] usfolks: I'm very much looking forward to seeing this. It's much appreciated. I didn't use those commands because of all the extra space taken up by the meter. This makes them usable again for me.

21:05:21 [MTTS] ricolachen: Now it's fixed. Thanks!

21:05:28 [MTTS] Squidmind: No problem.

21:05:43 [MTTS] usfolks: You guys rock.

21:06:19 [MTTS] Butchulla: You are appreciated and loved, hosties.

21:07:03 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Did more people go out of comms?"

21:07:11 [MTTS] Ulias: Yes, yes. These are all great changes. I have a lot of things already gagged, but even the gagging seems to slow things down a bit. I've already noticed a slight difference in how quick my text starts getting read.

21:07:15 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think Johann was planning another trip or something."

21:07:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. Most of my org...except me."

21:07:38 [General Communication] Aisling sighs.

21:08:16 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "How long are they planning to be gone?"

21:08:31 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would understand the feeling if I were you too, Aisling! They all told me secretly that they were trying to get away from you, and it seemed that putting hundreds of lightyears between them and you was their best possible temporary solution!"

21:08:42 [General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I noticed Nicolette is out and I was planning to speak to her."

21:09:15 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The only member of the org of shit needs to get exploration points for the shit!"

21:09:18 [MTTS] Squidmind: VIPmud is not exactly a paragon of efficiency, from everything I've ever heard.

21:09:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, here's an idea. Let's all leave too."

21:09:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. She went along on the trip. I honestly don't have a trip length I can tell you Ash. I do know that their plan is Andy's, then Tom Town, then I believe east from there."

21:09:43 [MTTS] Ulias: I actually still use GMUD.

21:09:51 [MTTS] atherj: ...

21:09:57 [MTTS] usfolks: Wow. I used GMUD 11 years ago...

21:09:58 [MTTS] atherj: People still use GMUD?

21:10:17 [MTTS] Ulias: No, not people. Just me apparently.

21:10:21 [MTTS] atherj: Eh, to be honest I would still use GMUD if there was a way of making it play multiple sounds at once. I am guilty.

21:10:21 [MTTS] usfolks: My experience with VIPMud as a low-vision player was not that great.

21:10:40 [MTTS] kaite: Wow yeah I haven't used GMUD in several years although I put in triggers for sounds.

21:10:45 [MTTS] atherj: Usfolks, did you try the invert colors option?

21:10:48 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah the sounds do cut each other off when they play, Luckily Ionly use like four sounds so it works fine.

21:11:16 [MTTS] usfolks: If only I could figure out this sound buffers issue I have in MUSH I'd be golden. And yes atherj. It would only do black on black...and I couldn't change or enlarge the font.

21:11:16 [MTTS] Butchulla: Wow, GMUD. That brings back memories.

21:11:16 [MTTS] atherj: I.E, making it white text on a black background?

21:11:38 [MTTS] atherj: Oh, yeah, you can't do that, tis true.

21:11:57 [MTTS] usfolks: Whenever I tried to do white on black, it would be black on black. I tried for about two weeks and gave up.

21:11:59 [MTTS] atherj: Everyone says that mush is probably the best client out there, I'm just too lazy to recreate all my stuff.

21:12:11 [MTTS] usfolks: I did all mine from scratch.

21:12:20 [MTTS] atherj: I did all mine from scratch too.

21:12:31 [MTTS] voyager1000: When I was low vision, I inverted VIPMud's color scheme to make it readable white on black. Had I known about mush when I got into mudding I wouldn't have paid for VIP. It's not too bad, it's simple and it works for the most part.

21:12:33 [MTTS] usfolks: Can't figure out any kind of gagging or the sound buffers. Someone showed me how to do the sound buffers but I just get errors.

21:12:35 [MTTS] atherj: Just hate the thought of doing them from scratch again on a client where I'd be learning as I was going along.

21:12:42 [MTTS] Butchulla: I can't choose a client, because when I'm using my eyes one is better, when I can't use my eyes, another is better. So I just...Deal.

21:13:17 [MTTS] usfolks: It's just a simple dialog box in MUSH. Easy enough to enter your triggers from VIP from the text file.

21:13:21 [MTTS] usfolks: No gags though.

21:13:39 [MTTS] atherj: Yeah, I want gags. Maybe not for SC, but for others.

21:14:11 [MTTS] ricolachen: I have a VIPMud to MUSHClient converter, but I'm still using VIP for most of my MUDing. I've coded my own output plugin for MUSH but it's not as stable as VIPMud's output.

21:14:15 [MTTS] Butchulla: There should so be a squidMUD. I'd buy it.

21:14:20 [MTTS] usfolks: If I could take the sound stuff from VIP and the visual from MUSH, it would be perfect.

21:14:36 [MTTS] atherj: Have you ever thought of writing to the developer of vipmud?

21:14:42 [MTTS] Ulias: If Squidmind came out with a VI friendly client, I bet it would be incredible.

21:15:16 [MTTS] usfolks: I have atherj, but considering I'm only having a small issue with MUSH, it's not all that worth it. I'm pretty used to what I can do with MUSH.

21:15:28 [MTTS] ricolachen: Also, MUSH has gags?

21:15:31 [MTTS] Ulias: Maybe they could get Belk to like, make a bunch of noises using his mouth to use for sounds, "pew pew pew"

21:15:46 [MTTS] Butchulla: Hahaha.

21:16:00 [MTTS] usfolks: Plus, since I know others can get it to work, it's on my end, not a client issue. And ricolachen, I haven't figured out how in any of the documentation.

21:16:06 [MTTS] voyager1000: The main issue I had with VIP when I could see wasn't the colors, it was the inability to adjust the font size.

21:16:23 [MTTS] usfolks: Exactly. And for me it's not just the size, it's the font itself.

21:16:29 [MTTS] Squidmind: We did approve a soundpack at one time, but last I checked, the website had disappeared.

21:16:32 [MTTS] ricolachen: It's just a simple checkbox in the trigger dialogue box. It's something like, 'remove it from the output'

21:16:34 [MTTS] usfolks: I can't read fixed-width fonts very well.

21:16:41 [MTTS] usfolks: Is that the randomcorner one Squid?

21:16:48 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes.

21:16:57 [MTTS] usfolks: I had no idea that had disappeared.

21:17:14 [MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah, but...A squid mud client, that would be wicked.

21:17:14 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh weird.

21:17:28 [MTTS] atherj: I just like creating my own. It's a very simple one without all the annoying bells and whistles that people tend to put into theirs, and I can be reasonably sure that mine has no cheatery in it!

21:17:43 [MTTS] voyager1000: I've had this sound pack for years now. I'm used to certain sounds for certain events.

21:18:01 [MTTS] atherj: I've seen some soundpacks that have triggers for the most ridiculous crap; kissing, slapping, sitting, standing...bit too much for me.

21:18:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Same atherj. I don't want room sounds, felo sounds, all the social sounds, etc. Just stuff specifically necessary for accessibility.

21:18:29 [MTTS] kaite: Me either and I typically turn them off or go comment out the references.

21:18:35 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, that's the exact reason I stopped using a soundpack, I got tired of it constantly whispering "hey" everytime someone said something.

21:18:49 [MTTS] atherj: Oh gosh they do that too now? Fuck that.

21:18:56 [MTTS] Ulias: And whispering and all that stuff.

21:19:00 [MTTS] Ulias: Er whistling.

21:19:18 [MTTS] usfolks: I have a simple beep sound for most say's. It gets my attention if I'm in another window and that's it.

21:19:29 [MTTS] Ulias: I don't know if they all do, but the one that I tried for VIPmud was constantly whisper"Hey"

21:19:50 [MTTS] voyager1000: I have this sort of breath sound whenever someone says something.

21:20:02 [MTTS] atherj: I don't even have that much. The only sound that I have as an indicator for me besides communicator sounds that someone is trying to reach me is a telephone ringing sound for the einrophone.

21:20:05 [MTTS] kaite: There is one site where they do a lot of two-year-old screaming and it is just because I know they like to trigger those sounds. It's rediculous and am so glad that isn't encouraged here.

21:20:09 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. I viewed the text files for several old ones and picked and chose stuff that I wanted and needed.

21:20:52 [MTTS] voyager1000: I don't like someone to laugh and then to hear a gender specific laugh sound. It breaks everything for me.

21:21:01 [MTTS] usfolks: Then used balabolka to make some TTS sounds for things I needed.

21:21:09 [MTTS] usfolks: Understood voyager1000.

21:21:14 [MTTS] voyager1000: Since the pack doesn't differentiate between male and female.

21:21:18 [MTTS] atherj: Bah, the sounds for roleplay interactions limit your imagination and are just annoying.

21:21:46 [MTTS] voyager1000: I'm working hard to avoid using built-in socials anyway.

21:21:49 [MTTS] Ulias: Yep, not having it spoon-fed to me is one of the things I fell in love with when it comes to these kinds games in the first place.

21:21:55 [MTTS] usfolks: Hear hear atherj.

21:22:34 [MTTS] Ulias: Using our imaginations is what makes these games great.

21:22:40 [MTTS] usfolks: Indeed.

21:22:47 [MTTS] Ulias: And Sc is the greatest!

21:23:11 [MTTS] usfolks: Quite so.

21:23:21 [MTTS] kaite: Yup I used GMUD when first started playing here and had no sounds for anything for except for what I could add and I had trouble with gmud because if the word.lis or whatever it's called file, if it gets too large, it crashes.

21:23:23 [MTTS] Butchulla: All hail SC? It's too early in the morning for this complex discussion.

21:23:44 [MTTS] Ulias: I still regret not having to been able to check out Fortharlin. I'd love to see that Squidmind take on fantasy.

21:24:02 [MTTS] voyager1000: I missed out on that too.

21:24:12 [MTTS] kaite: Same.

21:24:17 [MTTS] atherj: I would love love love to see work on fortharlin start back up again. Best midevil game out there ever. Better than any of the stupid ones available now, even in its older form.

21:24:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

21:24:35 [MTTS] Ulias: Everything I've ever heard about it on tis channel sounded amazing.

21:25:22 [MTTS] Ulias: GWSE sounded cool too, but we don't need another space game. That would just take away from SC.

21:25:33 [MTTS] usfolks: I kind of wish I could get into fantasy, but never much could. Was always a sci-fi person...and while so many have told me they go hand-in-hand, I just never could get into it.

21:25:38 [MTTS] atherj: Yeha, I'd rather see work on Fortharlin than GW:SE.

21:26:22 [MTTS] voyager1000: I have grinding moods sometimes, that's usually a week or two of Alter and then I'm done.

21:26:37 [MTTS] Ulias: Fortharlin didn't sound like it was about grinding at al.

21:26:58 [MTTS] voyager1000: I've not heard much about it.

21:27:15 [MTTS] kaite: Well my first mudding experience was on a couple of those and I occasionally go back to one when I need a break so I do enjoy it and it's a good way to bash at something without harming soemthing in real life hehe.

21:27:20 [MTTS] atherj: Na. Not grinding in its usual forms, to be sure. Though there were a few things you could technically have grinded out if you wanted to.

21:27:26 [MTTS] Ulias: I actually think of it when we're in the carriage riftscape, because I heard you had to take carriages and they took like hours to get to places and so forth.

21:27:34 [MTTS] atherj: Sometimes days.

21:27:42 [MTTS] atherj: If you didn't have access to a waystone.

21:27:54 [MTTS] Ulias: Tht's prety awesome though, if you have someone to RP with.

21:28:04 [MTTS] atherj: Pretty sure that was the idea, yep.

21:28:36 [MTTS] atherj: You could also buy your own mounts and everything. You had to deal with tiredness/hunger/thirst too, they had a more noticeable impact on your stats and the like.

21:28:41 [MTTS] usfolks: My first introduction to mudding was Aardwolf for about two weeks. When a friend tried to get me to play SC I said no for some time...then they told me how different it was from Aardwolf...and I tried it. And am very glad I did.

21:28:48 [MTTS] Ulias: Wasn't it permadeath too, though?

21:28:54 [MTTS] atherj: I was a flying fighter dude. I was working towards becoming a bladedancer.

21:29:23 [MTTS] atherj: There were possibilities of resurrection on Fortharlin.

21:29:44 [MTTS] atherj: Just like there were possibilities of resurrection on GW:SE if you remembered to clone yourself when you came back to life!

21:30:17 [MTTS] Squidmind: We've outlined most of a Fortharlin revision, did that years ago, in fact, but actually accomplishing it is a great deal more work.

21:30:31 [MTTS] atherj: I remember you guys mentioning what some of those would be.

21:30:45 [MTTS] atherj: They actually did sound pretty cool.

21:31:13 [MTTS] atherj: Weren't you guys planning on a classless system where you could just learn whatever skills?

21:32:04 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes. The skill web. Training in one skill would unlock access to related skills, and given enough time, you could make your way to any skill you wanted. Though there would've been tradeoffs too, of course.

21:32:14 [MTTS] atherj: For sure! Had to stay balanced.

21:32:18 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh wow.

21:36:10 [MTTS] atherj: At least you probably wouldn't have to necessarily re-code the game world from the ground up. The frame, however shaky, would still be there with only the need for reenforcement!

21:36:47 You remove a small package from a leather briefcase.

21:36:50 A small package is already open.

21:36:53 a small package

21:36:53 This is a package. It is addressed to Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident, and was sent by Melinda Michaels.
It is open.
Inside it you see a letter and a letter.

21:37:06 You remove a letter from a small package.

21:37:09 --
yo,

So, the real issue here is you took some time to make this decision to come home. You could have been forming a letter for me to bring home during the several hours in which Akemi informed you I was coming and the time that I got to Andy's.

You did not then have to come home and try to put this on me. I did not rush you. You had many hours to decide this stuff. I even asked you, before I left, if these are the things you wanted me to relay back home. You said yes.

Yes I was upset when I left because somebody was murdered, another beaten, arson to a library and one of mine stabbed. It didn't matter who requested you come home. What mattered was, crap was going down and you weren't coming, at that time, because people of your alliance did not ask for you specifically.

I was not rude to you nor did I pressure you into not giving a statement by leaving quickly. You could have easily said hold on, let me write something while you eat. You could have said, rest a little bit and let me think on this issue. You did none of these things and then tried to make it look like it's my fault for not giving you time.

Yes I am upset by that because I only came out there to help and get this shit thrown in my face as thanks. I am mostly upset because of this. I should have never found you guys at Andy's, you should have been on your way home and I don't care whose ship it is. Important things were going on here.

21:37:09 -

21:38:12 You put a letter in a small package.

21:38:59 You remove a letter from a small package.

21:39:03 --

21:39:03 Enclosed is the letter that I sent Lily. It doesn't matter who told me what, what matters is she was going to throw me under the bus to save her ass. This is why I posted my issue on general. So that I would not be posting it just on League and going behind her back.

So, that's that and how I feel. I would have never done that to her. I did not do the shit I am being accused of. Anyway, I am done.

22:43:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:43:43 You say, "oops"

22:43:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:43:52 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "There's a rental battlesuit. Are there rental ships, too?"

22:43:53 You sit down on a large leather lounge couch.

22:43:57 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

22:44:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

22:44:11 Lileah Rose says, "ok I went through the firt 30 sectors and didn't find the Trade ship so guess it's whereever you want to earn credits from at the moment"

22:44:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:44:17 You say, "ok"

22:44:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Indeed there are."

22:44:18 Lileah Rose sits down on a large leather lounge couch.

22:44:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:44:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:44:24 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

23:04:56 Lileah Rose suddenly awakens.

23:05:00 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Lasers Not Chainguns". The organization has earned 79,414.63 credits.

23:05:04 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

23:05:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:05:09 I don't understand that.

23:05:13 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

23:05:31 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:05:35 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

23:05:40 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of industrial slag.
