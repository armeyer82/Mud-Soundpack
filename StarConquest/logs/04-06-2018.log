01:20 You nod.

01:21 Lily Kaise says, "I might take the 6 or 7 I have and isolate them. I can't seem to keep consistent soldiers in Daisy May so I may put them iin there."

01:21 Lily Kaise says, "In there."

just trying to spend some money these days, so if you have a double minimod that you think that is rare, or better than the others, just let me know via mail.
telling the price is a plus.

04:32 A medium-sized shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

04:32 You glance at your communicator's screen.

04:32 There is one board post.

04:33 You ask, "Which film?"

04:34 Lily Kaise says, "Wiggly the cat."

04:34 Lily Kaise laughs.
