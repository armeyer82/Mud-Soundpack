Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We
need to take Shule's Carrier to get a Docking bay Upgrade at andy's. I wanted to
take the org one but I didn't put certain Upgrades from farport so that's sort
of out of the question on an indefinite basis. Anyway, there's an area not far
form tom Town that we could go to."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So
we could dock ships into the carrier but we'll need to see about a beacon for
Shule's Carrier or it will be very tedious."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And how do
people generally go about doing this? I was thinking of rifting somewhere in a
carrier with a module scout inside."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So is that how
we'd do it, then? Put a module scout with a passive beacon in the carrier?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Well yes that is an alternative but it only leaves a limited amount of space
for other ships since the standard capacity for a carrier without the Docking
bay upgrade is 100 units and the scout takes up 60."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "True."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"However, a Beacon with charging ability would work."

couldn't take many scouts because those require 12.5 units."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many

you got the upgrade."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alternatively."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"That's a possibility but Shule and I would probably just bring Sightseers which
only require 5 units."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
interesting."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I might
qualify for a sightseer by the time we do this."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would
really save space."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah
ok yeah that's what I would recommend and then we could take 2 scouts."

that would defeat the purpose of getting shule's carrier upgraded."
'So, we taking my carrier and where?
You ask, "So, we taking my carrier and where?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, if we're
making a trip out there anyway we may as well do that on the way. I was dreaming
of getting my carrier upgraded, not realizing that it takes quite a while to get
out there."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 10 July 2317 GST. Time remaining: 1 day, 1
hour, 58 minutes, and 9 seconds

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I was
thinking about our void piercer discussion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I noticed that
Ather's book lists a 10% speed boost on both the void piercer and the gemini."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But not on the
scout."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But Lily, your
scout speed you read off to us was the same as Eli's gemini speed."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Because the Scout is an aEU design whereas the others are not."

gemini is slower."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also
remember the Gem is not an Exploration ship. It does not have exploration
sensors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So do you think
it's the case then that the void piercer offers an AEU pilot no benefit, since
the scout is just as fast?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The speed is
really the only thing I was getting at."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was wondering
why I would ever want to own a void piercer if it's no faster than the scout."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The void piercer
isn't unique to the AEU, is it?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
it's a matter of personal preference versus your own economy. If you want a Void
Piercer, nobody is sstopping you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well yeah, I
understand that. I was just trying to figure out if there was any reason for me
to buy one."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope
the Void Piercer is available to anyone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not going to
buy one because it looks pretty."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it sounds
like the AEU scout makes the void piercer useless to us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I can just
forget about it, I guess."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm slightly
disappointed because I was looking forward to getting a new toy to play with
tomorrow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess if I
don't need it, I don't need it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I certainly
don't need a toy with no guns that isn't faster than my scout."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I bought a gemini and
tug today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess it does

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey
it's your money though. I don't really artifact locally anymore because I only
earn just credits from them now so I personally don't need a Void Piercer and I
rarely use my Exploraiton Scout either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll have to
think about if that's worth it to me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, pointless
if it isn't faster. That's the whole reason I wanted one."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I've
been saying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It lists both
the void piercer and the gem as 110% speed ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And doesn't list
any such bonus on the scout."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh
well it is but not significantly faster than our own."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if your
scout and Eli's gem move at the same speed, then I think I can't expect the void
piercer to be any faster."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless the
book's information is incomplete in some way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I can
just buy one and look."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Our scout is actually faster thn the gem."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I will have to read his book as there may
be an error."
'Yeah, maybe.
You say, "Yeah, maybe."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He may have put the speed of the Advanced
scout in there and not the Exploration Scout."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "If you want, it'll
make things quicker. I'd have to make a manual approach."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, be right
there."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He could have gotten it
coming into Orion. If there's a spreader it woulda moved after that. I'm
listenin to the scanner now. Have they evern shown up at temp stations in the
middle of nowhere or just round normal beacons?"
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I have never seen one at a
temp, but you never know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."
[Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I've never seen--yeah."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, me neither, but he got
it somwewhere, and I doubt he was at Dure or Tenosque on the way back from the
Bubble."
[Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "So maybe there's something
at 287."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Could be. I can run out in a
capsule to check and take felo out there if there is somethin. Would be quicker
than takin a bigger ship out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "One more shot would
have taken her out."
[Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It might be worth taking a
look."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Any idea where he was when he
discovered 'em and if it was just the regular early infestation?"
[Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "When he told us on
tactical, he was west of orion. He said he wasn't sure how long he'd had them."
[Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lemme check over there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I guess its time to go
back?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Back to the

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "After repairs, yeah.
We got to deal with the newcomers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you can go
back. It's a fighter and a corvette now. Want to team up for it?"

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and
painted gunmetal grey.
It has a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

On the north side of this street are old houses, some with big trees in the
front that shade the sidewalk, but on the south side is an eclectic combination
of established Ardsley businesses relocated from elsewhere in town, including
the Stationery Bazaar and the recently reopened Linens and Stuff. Over the
rooftops, past the edge of town to the south, you can see the rolling landscape
of farms and hills, though some of the once open acreage is now occupied by new
housing developments.

The buildings here are an interesting mix of pretty new shops, utilitarian
warehouses, and old homes predating the war. Beyond the buildings on the north
side of the street is a new housing area built on a hill. To the south, front
and center in a new cluster of businesses, is Sparkles, a toiletries store with
many sparkly items in the spotlessly clean display windows. Beyond the rooftops
of Sparkles and the other businesses there is Ardsley's landscape of farms and
rolling hills, though new building has recently encroached upon the open lands.
An old ice cream truck is parked here on the side of the street.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

changelog
Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Arachnopals no longer transcend time and space, and now cannot move in
directions beyond our comprehension.
   Posted 3 days, 19 hours, 46 minutes, and 53 seconds ago
-----
At long last, the STANDINGS command now gives far greater detail than a simple
like or dislike! 
Please look forward to new additions to this system in the future.
   Posted 2 days, 12 hours, 20 minutes, and 27 seconds ago
-----
Battlesuit energy may now be checked through roundtime.
   Posted 1 day, 13 hours, 34 minutes, and 34 seconds ago
-----
Ships that are unable to salvage (fighters, certain transports, etc) can no
longer deploy atmospheric scoops. This was a bit of an oversight, and we deeply
apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.
Atmospheric scoops on ships that can no longer do so, of course, be transferred
off.
   Posted 1 day, 5 hours, 5 minutes, and 17 seconds ago
-----
Implemented a fix for ground enemies who fail to react after a failed encounter
is regenerated. Be sure to send a support ticket if you notice this still
happening.
   Posted 19 hours, 6 minutes, and 44 seconds ago

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the
humanoid service robot here.

Subject: Artifact Alpha 777 - Building Plan
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 16:51 20 August 2317 GST
--
Regarding how we'll proceed to maintain Artifact Alpha 777 the following is the
current plan --
1. We'll maintain a complement of the Modules which SEAS Contributes on 'SEAS
Spare Parts'
2. LIBS will designate where their parts will be available.
3. It's hard to get Nicolette to be consistent concerning where she loads the
Core and other Modules from her org so will probably move them to 'SEAS Spare
Parts' as they do pose quite a bit of clutter aboard 'Herding Cats'.
Since Artifact Alpha is comprised of eight stations If Seas is primarily
responsible for four of them, and Libs is primarily responsible for the other
four, it hopefully will be less confusing if we do the following.
LIBS will maintain the accelerators, Salvage processor, and watchtower
Seas will maintain the beacons, transmitter, and charger.
Please watch the Range Office and keep notes on when these Temporary Space
Stations will need to be renewed. Whenever circumstances prevent any of us from
being available to deploy the stations which we are responsible for, please
contact me or communicate with Evenia and/or Johann.

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.

going to damage the Union. I don't agree with what the Union is doing, but this
really isn't hurting it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's
not hurting it because not everyone is participating as fully as I am."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "The Pilot
Corps is not the Union's primary form of infrastructure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I think we also should

myself and Dakhal non stop over the strike."

the two-person flare "Deadly Strike"
You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and
painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic
radome on the forward end.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green
leather captain's chair here.

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their
actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a
vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be
'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot
and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their
exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's
character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a
special application in character generation.
The following is a listing of current and former (player character) pilots
holding ace or veteran status.

with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

Lily says to Dakhal, "Actually they walked out as I said what I said and the
answer is no."
Tara Flores rolls her eyes.
-tara I'd really recommend renting a short-term fighter.
You say to Tara, "I'd really recommend renting a short-term fighter."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Patriot Dakhal Araegin chuckles at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Dakhal says to Tara, "Why, yes, I am worse than Vernos. Nice to meet you."
Tara says to you, "Don't they lack a hyperdrive though?"
Patriot Dakhal Araegin says, "Now, excuse me while I sell out my fellow pilots."
Tara says to Dakhal, "But you aren't."
Tara says to you, "Jump drive, I mean."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup rentals are a good way to go when just
starting out as if you lose it, you'll not make the rental guy happy but it
doesn't affect our ship losses."
headshake tara 'The short-term fighters have an ftl drive. Go to Tannhauser

Tara says to Dakhal, "Oh, your term start soon doesn't it? Have any plan for
it?"
'Read lots of reports and give lots of updates.
You say, "Read lots of reports and give lots of updates."

landing pad.
Lily says to Dakhal, "Give the terminal in there a good examination as there is
informaiton and then just look over the options there and there will probably be
a pile of old reports on the desk."
A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the
two-person Accord gemini "Hawthorne's Gyrfalcon" as it settles down upon the
nearby landing pad.
Melinda says to Tara, "You must be the roid hauler?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Melinda Michaels.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Melinda says to Tara, "I roid hauled for awhile when I was getting started."
Melinda Michaels says, "Like a day."
You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by
loud swearing.
Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I dunno. It's an invasion apparently."
Morris Corlew takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Gotta go where the party is."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Oh ther is?"
Morris Corlew says, "Mmhmm."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.
Tara says to Melinda, "Hauling is pretty lax. I think the most enjoyable
industry activity for me is mining sites, with salvaging right behind it."
Morris Corlew says, "Where the turnovers are."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident switches a flight control scanner on.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs at a flight control scanner.
Melinda says to Tara, "I will agree there. I like mining best of the industry
work."
Morris Corlew gestures vaguely at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Lily loves
minin. She can probably help ya out."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs at Melinda Michaels.

Lily says to Melinda, "Maybe Tara knows?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Well, my first
flight was not a failure at all. Thankfully. I was afraid the grapple would
break on me."
A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then
they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.
tra 1 Glad to hear that.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Glad to hear that."
Melinda says to Lily, "Probably but I didn't want to bother the new pilot."

those grapples are sturdy."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Oh yeah, mining. I did a ton of that early on."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Mining and trading were how I made all my money."
A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the
one-person cargo hauler "Comet Ray" as it settles down upon the nearby landing
pad.
[MTTS] blindbat84: Oh very nice new ambiance in the New Earth lounge.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.
l
[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending
machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
Patriot Dakhal Araegin, Tara Flores, Morris Corlew, Melinda Michaels, Tobias
Hawthorne, and Nissi Valdaire are standing here.
You can go out.
The volume of conversation rises briefly on the other side of the room.
Tara Flores says, "I've wanted to try trading, but spending the time to figure
out routes seems like a waste when I can just sit down for two hours and command
drones like im some sort a drone army commander."
Tara Flores chuckles.
[MTTS] usfolks: Probably more accurate than the heated political debates. I love
it.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Nissi Valdaire nods.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I was gonna give you a hint then I remembered the skim
access thing."
Nissi Valdaire gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.
sit couch
You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I'd get caught out trading something
where i'm not supposed to so I am leary of trading."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Well without the skim, the best trading would be
contraband."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."
Melinda Michaels says, "Which, I have never ever done."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So my only trading was way out there."
Nissi Valdaire says, "But if you do get access back, start at the Mutuality
stations. Some good routes trading with them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And running some suppies to the Children of
the Sun."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Supplies."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah it seemed so when I could still trade
with them."
A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.
Tobias Hawthorne stalks out.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's
neck.
Melinda says to Tara, "So, is Eve the power couple? I really have a reason for
wanting to know other than just to know."
Tobias Hawthorne just arrived.
Tobias Hawthorne orders a bottle of sparkling water flavored with natural mango
juice.
Morris Corlew takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a piping hot turnover filled with meatball.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a piping hot turnover filled with meatball
in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once,
then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and
immediately swallowing it whole.
Tara says to Melinda, "I'm not even sure. I mean she was here encouraging me to
do what I do as a pilot and not to let people on the general channel get me
down. Then that news thing popped up."
Tara Flores shrugs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a hot cup of espresso.
Tara Flores says, "Quite litereally ten minutes after she left."
Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
A technician wanders in, orders a cup of coffee, then hurries back out with the
steaming beverage.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.
Tara Flores asks, "News travels fast?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yup amongst pilots!"
Morris Corlew says, "In the corps, faster than a PWD."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
Melinda says to Tara, "Ah ha, it was then. Funny thing is, when Eli is around
she encourages him to do what he is doing. Now she is encouraging to do what is
against what he does. So, my advice to you is, watch that one."
Patriot Dakhal Araegin takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with
pepperoni and cheese.
Morris Corlew finishes off a piping hot turnover filled with cheese steak.
Morris dusts his hands.
Tobias Hawthorne twists off the cap from his bottle of water, pockets it and
sips at it slowly, leaning back against the bar.

You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person fighter
"The Claw" lift off the landing pad and head into space.
Tara Flores says, "But no really, she was just trying to encourage me. It had
nothing to do with the politics of whats going on."
Morris Corlew blinks.
Melinda Michaels grins at Tara Flores. "You will see."
Melinda says to Tara, "Anyway, it is nice to meet you in person and hey, if you
want to work, work."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
-melinda Nice to meet you in person too.
You say to Melinda, "Nice to meet you in person too."
Tara Flores asks, "I'm too new of a pilot to not work. I became a pilot for a
reason. Why would I sit on my butt and do nothing so early in my career?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah. People are just frustrated cuz they don't wanna see
this Outccord thing happen. Erik especially is a little too worked up about it."
Morris Corlew chuckles at you.
Tara says to Melinda, "Nice to meet you though!"

pistachio juice.

A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's
neck.
Morris says to Aisling, "There was a party. And...we wanted to...read the news
together. And things. And eat turnovers."
Melinda says to Aisling, "We wanted to see the new power couple."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I wanted to say earlier too, there's usually somebody
willing to run out and scare off Ares, but don't let their plinky little lasers
fool you. Most ships can take those out. Even had transports and asteroid
haulers fight em off. It's good practice if you've got the time."

A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."
Melinda Michaels asks, "Is the watch tower up out there?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well there's generally one."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's neck.
Tara Flores says, "Nope. I didn't see one."
Morris says to Lily, "The stations out there are kinda whopperjawed and I'm
tryin to get 'em worked out."
Morris says to Melinda, "No."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Aisling asks, "Whopperjawed?"
Aisling says, "You are just making shite up now."
Morris Corlew nods to Aisling. "Outta allignment."
Lily says to Melinda, "Please get Joel to put a stealth sheathing on Joy Ride. I
can't use his cores."
Tara Flores says, "I upgraded my haulers hull plating though. Those lasers might
have range but they barely scorched my hull."
Melinda says to Lily, "My ship is not his spare parts ship. If he does not give
you parts, screw it and leave him out."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yup tht's what happens."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."
Morris says to Aisling, "Hmm...Kattywampus then?"
Melinda says to Lily, "If you find a part of his on my ship, you are welcome to
use it but yeah. They overloaded my ship once and I got after them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Aisling stares blankly at Morris.
Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well he's put a few cores on but I use
Nicolette's for the Asteroid Processor so yeah."
Tobias says to Morris, "Thrown together from the parts you could cobble
together, pretty much is the point?"
A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back

instruction."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a cup in a shiny chrome trash bin.
Morris Corlew says, "Or a book apparently."
Tobias Hawthorne says, "That book is a lifesaver."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh that book was out of date 2 days after
published though."
Morris says to Lily, "Not that bad."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "New orgs come along and then people change
responsibilities and so on."
Morris Corlew says, "So the beacon has waaaay longer than the accelerator and
there was no watchtower as it was, and I'm tryin to get the timin back set up."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back
out.
Melinda Michaels says, "The book isn't really out of date."
Morris Corlew says, "It ain't. Only things different in it are the autonavs."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't think SEAS is in there heh."
Morris says to Lily, "Seas ain't gotta be in there."
Tara Flores says, "Parts parts.. I'm having trouble following what you guys are
talking about."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Unless a revision occurred since I bought
one."
Morris says to Lily, "Y'all are on our parts. So why wouldja need to be in
there?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because we build the Asteroid Processor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Uh oh. I jumped back

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 10 July 2317 GST. Time remaining: 1 minute

Greetings AEU! My name is Shule and I am your new Space Defense Captain. A
couple of reminders. Please keep your ships powered down on landing pads and
garaged where possible to help prevent bari infestations. If you find your ship
is infested, do not land and say something over the alliance channel or tactical
channel. Second, please tune your communicators to the alliance tuner or 0 and
monitor channel 4. If you do hear of a sector going on alert, please say
something over the alliance channel or over tactical. Third, if you would like
assistance in learning any aspect of space combat: gunning, flying, or
engineering, please don't hesitate to get in touch with me. Letters addressed to
Shule will find me or you can reach me on comms or by calling the Space Defense
Captain's office at 0010-89705. Take care and fly safe.

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I'm pleased to serve you once
again as Ground Squad Leader. Please feel free to contact me for any questions
you have.... The Old Frontier Asteroid Mining Processor was cleansed of bari a
day ago. There's still one day remaining before it closes for this Conquest to
enjoy the best Asteroid Mining around, or if you're not into much work these
days, enjoy a drink up in the Star Lounge. The Ship Shop also has some Upgrades.
We'll gather another crew soon after the beginning of next Conquest to repeat
the process! [00:10 21 August 2317 GST]

Shule, Lily and I as well as the Navy responded to a force of pirates in Aenea

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a Tardick
lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I am sure if you
were around, you would have as well, since that is the defense of our space and
not an invitation to the Outsiders."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm
trying to tell you guys, maybe if we don't work to help performance goals
anymore, it will make the government at least reconsider. Is a few extra credits
really worth leaving the accord?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "If I could forgo
all of my credits in lieu of exclusively earning points, sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's
true, no one hates Kelsey as much as I do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't want to
leave the Accord, but just looking at the conquest data tells me that the strike
isn't doing anything because it's not a full strike."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
can't stop you from working, of course. Just don't stop to wonder later on when
the situation only ends up getting worse. I'm still doing my part, and I warned
you all already about the consequences of leaving the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I already said it
before, but we also need to watch out for Best wanting to privitize our corps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
don't have to do everything by the letter of the broadcast. Take the initiative
like I did. Make yourself partake in a full strike. Try to convince your fellow
pilots like I'm trying to do right now to partake in a full strike."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Obviously, a partial strike, like you said, did not work. So shut down. Do
nothing. Only protect our space, and fulfill the letter of the non-aggression
pacts, and help the other alliances if they ask for it. Protect the Accord if it
becomes necessary too. Nothing else."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd call you to
speak of some things, Ather, but I don't have your number. Mine is posted if you
care to have a talk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm
about to go to bed, and I'd like to give your discussion the full awareness that
it probably deserves. So can we do it sometime tomorrow afternoon? I should be
around all day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll be around,
yeah. We'll talk then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I don't mind talking
either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Like I said, we should
probably discuss the privatization too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Sounds good. In the meantime, I urge all of you to at least consider what I
said."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Well, haven't heard any
howling yet.. And we're slowly traversing sectors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "...aaaaand, I didn't
fall into a crater. So, overall a positive experience."

Also, I don't know if he did or didn't fall into a crater."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The first time you
hear those anchors of the ship dig into the asteroid is quite startling, Huh?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "But he's not all..
space dusty, so I think he didn't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Would the dust even
stick to the suit in Zero g?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Heh, it was,
interesting to say the least. Wasn't quite expecting to be firing a cannon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's the most fun

Minor Change:
The minimum payment for a fine is now one million credits or one fifth of the
fine amount, whichever is smaller.
This will have the effect of reducing the financial strain on people with
moderate to severe fines, as previously it was simply one fifth of the fine
amount, regardless of how large the fine was. In certain instances this means
the minimum payment would reach into the tens of millions or higher.

You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch
clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

l launcher
a decoy beacon launcher
You see that it is loaded with 1 decoy beacons.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
exh4i_6t6b)1}lc~?T4u]11{.${WbO^%.]E7J$2?
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds
unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station
transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2482 light-minutes per second from
Galactic West and Very Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Deadly Strike.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

ftl accord
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."

hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving
soon. What actions do you take?
5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what
would be your priority and why?
7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing
commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?

2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
I would report my location, number and class of enemy ships and request
reinforcements over tactical. I would also recommend that a crew be placed on
stand-by at the civilian location. While reinforcements are on the way, I would
engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships as well as destroy any
interdictors in the sector. Then I would simply attempt to destroy all of the
enemy ships. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human alliance space
from all hostile threats.

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yo."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."
 I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily on lasers
that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is able to
recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is depleted, the
ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of being short a
gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can move to the
empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons room's grid is
recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer to apply quick
patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not.
Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can increase the damage
for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for being short a gunner.

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving

[General Communication] Erik says in a tone dripping with sarcasm, "I'm loving
the headlines. arn't they great?"
I attempt to destroy any chaining ships, interdicting ships and any interdictors
in the sector all the while staying close to the edge in order to make a quick
get away. Having taken note of the number of ships remaining in the sector, I
leave, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine the number of the
reinforcing ships. I report all of this over tactical and ask for
reinforcements.

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
We destroy the escorting ships and leave since this kind of ship cannot be
destroyed by conventional weapons. The last magistrate-class mothership had to
be captured with the use of battle suits. We contact the Accord and don't come
back without cruisers that have been adapted with special shielding that can
repel a PDB and battle suits.

the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and one must fly through
those sectors to get to capitol sectors. If, for example, providence Gate were
to be interdicted, other ships would not be able to get to New Earth until such
time that Providence Gate was no longer interdicted.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Someone with red should GMG

I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily on lasers
that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is able to
recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is depleted, the
ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of being short a
gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can move to the
empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons room's grid is
recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer to apply quick
patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not.
Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can increase the damage
for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for being short a gunner.

goal would be to try to cripple it as much as possible and still save my ship.
2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
You entered: I would report my location, number and class of enemy ships and
request reinforcements over tactical. I would also recommend that a crew be
placed on stand-by at the civilian location. While reinforcements are on the
way, I would engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships as well as destroy
any interdictors in the sector. Then I would simply attempt to destroy all of
the enemy ships. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human alliance
space from all hostile threats.
3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
You entered: I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily
on lasers that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is
able to recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is
depleted, the ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of
being short a gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can
move to the empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons
room's grid is recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer
to apply quick patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a
failsafe or not. Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can
increase the damage for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for
being short a gunner.
4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving
soon. What actions do you take?
You entered: I attempt to destroy any chaining ships, interdicting ships and any
interdictors in the sector all the while staying close to the edge in order to
make a quick get away. Having taken note of the number of ships remaining in the
sector, I leave, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine the
number of the reinforcing ships. I report all of this over tactical and ask for
reinforcements.
5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
You entered: We destroy the escorting ships and leave since this kind of ship
cannot be destroyed by conventional weapons. The last magistrate-class
mothership had to be captured with the use of battle suits. We contact the
Accord and don't come back without cruisers that have been adapted with special
shielding that can repel a PDB and battle suits.
6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what
would be your priority and why?
You entered: My priority would be the capitol planets as they are the most
inhabited and also the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and
one must fly through those sectors to get to capitol sectors. If, for example,
providence Gate were to be interdicted, other ships would not be able to get to
New Earth until such time that Providence Gate was no longer interdicted. 
7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing
commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?
You entered: I would simply obey the naval wing commander within reason,
ensuring first that I understood everything he or she asked of me and my crew.
8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issues
missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?
You entered: I have fought against Lambda Pirate Cartel, Omega Pirate Cartel,
allied pirate / merry band and unreg  ships during salvage ops and minor
skirmishes.
9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?
You entered: When I am solo, I tend not to begin repairs as soon as I should.
You entered: Well, since I tend to get hit at least once during a beacon or 
combat situation, not long. I plan to conduct a beacon drop as soon as I can
after purchasing and upgrading it.
11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?
You entered: Perhaps during an invasion or if I attempt a very high decoy beacon
drop in it, but hopefully, it will never be destroyed.
12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?
You entered: Lethal Strike
13. You must choose a theme song that you will completely rock out to while
fighting. What song do you choose?
You entered: Thunderstruck by ACDC
14. What is your favorite color?
You entered: Red

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
