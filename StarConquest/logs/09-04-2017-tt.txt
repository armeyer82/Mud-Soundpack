Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top, a pair of violet red leather boots decorated with neon red stars, and
a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

Ali and Erik,
You've been given Standard access to SEAS Warehouse.
For this next build and deployment of the Asteroid Processor and Rift
Accelerator in 288, we are willing to provide a Fission breeder reactor module
for the Asteroid processor. i have some Cores stored which i have purchased in
my name which if you don't mind an AEU core on an Accelerator, then feel free to
use them or any other module which has my name on it or SEAS. Otherwise I can
load a Basic Control Center for a Top for the Accelerator or whatever you need
except we won't contribute Passive Beacons at this time. If you absolutely need
a Passive Beacon, please inquire first.
As for the trial basis, pleas include us on the next build and we'll observe the
results. If they aren't sufficient, we'll likely not want to participate but
occasionally as we don't have as high of a balance in Megacredits as other
organizations and we're still under 2000 Command and although we have ample
Credits, we aren't yet able to convert Credits to Megacredits and the Fission
Breeder Reactor costs 10 Megacredits, hence it's one of the most pricey Modules.
If you need anything and I'm not available, feel free to call upon Shule,
Constantine or Tara to load necessary Modules. Tara is a new Pilot so she may
need a little coaching but she's very capable.
We'll let you know if we will continue to participate in tine prior to the
deployment of the next Asteroid Processor.
Regards,
Lily Kaise
