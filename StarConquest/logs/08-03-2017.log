00:06:52 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "War games are sure fun to watch."

00:11:14 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

00:11:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

01:22:27 I don't understand that.

01:24:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

01:24:11 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:24:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:24:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:20:41 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

02:20:57 You say, "That's probably good enough."

02:21:00 You grin.

02:21:00 Lileah Rose says, "just need a small piece or two"

02:21:09 Lileah Rose grins.

02:21:12 Invalid selection.

02:21:13 You grin.

02:21:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:21:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:21:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:21:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:21:32 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Yuuijuminlakiltra.

02:21:34 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:21:48 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

02:21:50 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:21:55 The Jinu starship "Yuuijuminlakiltra" has a docking bay large enough to contain this ship.  You can request entry into its docking bay, or dock in the usual manner by connecting to the docking ring near the control room.

02:21:55 Would you like to request entry into the docking bay?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

02:23:35 You power up the ship's engines, and the docking bay door begins to open slowly.

02:23:38 You grin.

02:23:40 A launch trajectory is located.

02:23:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:23:48 The computer reports that the one-person salvage junker "Black Sun" has jumped out of the sector.

02:23:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:23:53 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

02:23:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:25:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:25:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:25:19 Lileah Rose exclaims, "hey go get more!"

02:25:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:19:24 Lileah Rose exclaims, "all right!"

03:19:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:19:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:19:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:21:56 A launch trajectory is located.

03:21:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:22:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:22:08 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

03:22:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:22:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:22:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:36:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "A half hour ago."

04:36:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, cool."

04:38:26 Lileah Rose continues stroking you and massaging you ... occasionally pulling you tight. She gently touches and strokes your sensitive spot.

04:41:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "The prince flies, yet again."

04:42:06 Lileah Rose whispers, "well i I don't mind that but it's not what i consider that sexy!"

04:42:09 Lileah Rose laughs.

04:42:26 You grin.

04:42:43 You whisper to Lileah Rose.

04:42:54 Lileah Rose giggles at you.

04:43:05 Lileah Rose says to you, "i mean how do you fele about that?"

04:44:22 You whisper to Lileah Rose.

04:44:30 Lileah Rose grins at you.

04:44:53 Lileah Rose kisses and licks you on your groin

04:46:49 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

04:47:00 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

04:47:42 Rolando Caganda  rubs your clit faster and more firmly.

04:47:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hmm."

04:48:18 Lileah Rose moves her hips gently and sighs softly

04:49:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Do you have any experience working with corporations, Con?"

04:49:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's happening?"

04:49:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like what corporations?"

04:49:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Such as Unreality Programming on New Earth."

04:49:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, sure."

04:49:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I run packages and what not for them all the time."

04:50:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm really hoping that they've a better idea of a ship than this heap of junk they have me using."

04:50:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's great if you want to do some work, but want to stick close to home space."

04:50:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think, anyway."

04:50:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you'll get better ships as you get promoted."

04:51:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Honestly your best bet is to forget about hauling cargo and just deliver messages."

04:51:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The reports and such."

04:51:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "And the promotions are considered at each paycheck, I'm assuming."

04:51:22 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'thirty minutes.'"

04:51:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That gets you promoted faster, and you'll be able to make more money hauling cargo once you get promoted and get bigger ships."

04:51:41 Lileah Rose massages and strokes you ... smiling as she notices you getting firm and erect.

04:51:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, they can conduct employee reviews and promote you whenever."

04:52:21 Rolando Caganda  grows hard with your touch and rubs your clit even faster and more firmly as he plants kisses on your chest, neck and lips.

04:52:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I want to say they pay at 0000 on Fridays."

04:52:37 Lileah Rose beams at you.

04:52:46 Lileah Rose exclaims, "oh you are so perfect!"

04:53:04 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

04:53:08 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

04:53:16 You say to Lileah Rose, "You are so perfect for me!"

04:53:35 Lileah Rose massages and strokes while leaning down to lick and kiss your manness.

04:53:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Mm. Well, I wonder how many messages I'll need to deliver before they trust me with something larger. This hold is smaller than a basic hauler."

04:53:43 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

04:53:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm."

04:53:47 You smile at Lileah Rose.

04:54:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't remember. I've been promoted four times I think, and I have almost 550 deliveries."

04:54:02 Lileah Rose whispers, "are you ready to go inside Love?"

04:54:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though to be honest, I don't know what their rationale is."

04:54:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You should get the first one pretty quickly though, I should think."

04:54:43 Rolando Caganda  leans down and brushes his tongue along the length of your slit before dipping the tip of it in your vagina. Coming back up, he whispers, "Definitely."

04:54:51 Lileah Rose beams at you.

04:54:57 You sit up onto a lavender tapestry sectional sofa.

04:55:01 You lie down on Lileah Rose.

04:55:12 Lileah Rose gently guides you inside

04:55:35 Lileah Rose pushes up towards you ... wrapping her arms around you

04:55:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Is two million a hour good, Con?"

04:55:38 Rolando Caganda  moves his hips, penerating you deep and beginning to thrust rhythimcally.

04:55:57 Lileah Rose sighs and moans softly with pleasure.

04:56:03 Rolando Caganda  wraps his arms around you as he increases his pace.

04:56:17 Lileah Rose moves her hips in unison with your rhythm

04:56:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That depends on your conversion. Since you just started that number's going to go way, way up."

04:56:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think when you're done it will be closer to 15-20 per hour."

04:57:03 Rolando Caganda  kisses you passionately, letting his tongue slip between your lips as he continues to increase his pace.

04:57:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's typically a huge bump when you cross 50% conversion."

04:57:23 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the one-person bastille "Tempered Dragonfly".

04:57:45 Lileah Rose kisses you passionately ... playing her tongue over yours. Savoring your taste and loving your warmth.

04:57:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like on my sites after the first hour I've made about 8 million, but when I'm done I get more than 60 per hour."

04:58:34 Lileah Rose sighs as she begins to pulse and tingle ... she moans softly as she reaches her ecstacy

04:58:56 Rolando Caganda  continues to thrust  rhythmically and with a soft moan, you feel him tense and pulse inside you.

04:58:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah my compensation per hour is going up fairly quickly now. I have the mining outpost fully designed."

04:59:07 Lileah Rose puts her arms tightly around you and squeezes you tightly

04:59:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

04:59:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I really like this virtual view."

04:59:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, it's way easier to use."

04:59:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I meant to write that in my note."

04:59:31 Rolando Caganda  wraps his arms tightly around you and softly caresses your back.

05:00:06 Lileah Rose holds you lovingly in her arms and kisses you and gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.

05:00:36 Rolando Caganda  smiles down at you and gazes into your eyes.

05:01:01 Lileah Rose gazes up at you looking long and deep into your eyes.

05:01:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nine mining points in a hour."

05:01:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm still not entirely sure what those do."

05:01:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

05:01:16 Lileah Rose kisses you.

05:01:22 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

05:01:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think they might just be an indicator of how much you mine."

05:01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Which ones?"

05:01:38 You kiss Lileah Rose.

05:01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mining points."

05:01:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh."

05:01:43 You smile at Lileah Rose.

05:01:54 Lileah Rose squeezes you affectionately.

05:02:14 Rolando Caganda  squeezes you affectionately as he whipsers quietly, "I love you."

05:02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think that's what goes on your points prinout? I'm not sure."

05:02:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, they're definitely listed on the points printout."

05:02:56 Lileah Rose ruffles your hair and puts her arms around you and whispers I love you too.

05:03:34 You beam at Lileah Rose.

05:03:41 Lileah Rose beams at you.

05:05:04 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

05:05:18 You say to Lileah Rose, "Shall we go lie down in bed?"

05:05:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What is the load balance task for carrier drones?"

05:05:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So."

05:06:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In that picture I sent you."

05:06:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Every drill was one space away from an ore processor."

05:06:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Carrier drones? I never use carrier drones. I just use the basic ones."

05:07:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Drones will preferentially take ore from drills to the closest processor."

05:07:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which can really mess you up. You can end up with all the ore going to one processor."

05:07:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Load balance fixes that problem, but you can also fix it by placing your buildings carefully."

05:08:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So yeah, I also don't do that."

05:08:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's easy enough just to set the buildings up in such a way that it isn't a problem."

05:08:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I misplaced one building but it didnt interfere with anything, thankfully."

05:09:10 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I couldn't get to my comm before. But fly dragonfly. Fly!"

05:09:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thirty percent conversion."

05:09:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

05:10:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Poachers!"

05:10:55 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And storm Firestorm. Storm?"

05:11:23 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'ten minutes.'"

05:11:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Run 'em off!"

05:11:47 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

05:12:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach mutters.

05:12:15 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

05:12:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh wow that's a lot of poacher drones."

05:13:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, they're attracted by your available metals."

05:13:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the longer the site runs the more will come in each wave."

05:13:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "At least I believe this to be the case."

05:13:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, no wonder. I've three thousand unused metal."

05:13:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Because when I suspect an attack is imminent during my building phase, I try to spend down to zero, and this always results in a pitiful 3-drone wave coming at me."

05:14:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The way I have my defenses set up, the poacher drones pretty much just walk into a hail of chainguns and sniper fire."

05:14:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

05:14:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What setup did you use?"

05:15:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Three probes in the old frontier, Dak."

05:15:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you're not buys."

05:15:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone coughs.

05:15:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Two chain guns southeast and south west of the control, and same for north east and northwest, and two snipers on the north and south side of the op."

05:15:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Busy."

05:16:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I can clear them out."

05:16:37 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

05:17:25 Lileah Rose whispers, "you ready to go lie down in a real bed Hun?"

05:17:37 You nod to Lileah Rose.

05:17:40 You smile at Lileah Rose.

05:17:41 You stand up.

05:17:44 You need to leave Lileah Rose's group first.

05:17:45 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

05:17:49 Lileah Rose stands up.

05:17:57 Lileah Rose grins.

05:17:58 You follow Lileah Rose down.

05:17:58 [Starship "Blueberry"; Corridor Alpha]
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go south, west, up, and down.

05:18:00 You follow Lileah Rose down.

05:18:00 [Starship "Blueberry"; Corridor Beta]
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go east, west, up, and down.

05:18:02 You follow Lileah Rose west.

05:18:02 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters Block Alpha]
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go north, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

05:18:04 You follow Lileah Rose north.

05:18:05 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, and a cedar dresser here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go out.

05:18:11 Lileah Rose lies down on a walnut canopy bed.

05:18:11 You lie down on a walnut canopy bed.

05:18:18 You smile.

05:18:21 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

05:19:58 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good night all."

05:20:06 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good night."

05:20:14 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

05:20:21 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Good night."

05:20:28 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Night!"

05:21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh, okay. Looks like I got that promotion."

05:21:24 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra et bruyo. Poae bruyo won ske bruyi sket jukl gary wuharel."

05:21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Congrats."

05:21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

05:22:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Guess I'll have to check on that new ship after I clear out the Frontier."

05:22:47 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

05:25:13 You kiss Lileah Rose.

05:26:02 You say to Lileah Rose, "I should go to sleep. Good night. I love you."

05:28:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice job."

05:28:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm going to assume you're speaking of the RATS."

05:29:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep, nice shootin'"

05:29:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm not too pleased of the damages I took. I wasn't notified of a single lock."

05:30:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, Rats don't need to lock onto you to use their drills."

05:30:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll get lock notifications from heavy fighters and reapers, but not for their drills."

05:31:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's basically no way to dodge drills."

05:31:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "This explains so much."

05:31:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Other than just being out of range."

05:31:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've been really frustrated with mistakes that aren't even mistakes."

05:32:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah. You did. Rats are easy to fight individually but that's what makes them dangerous in groups."

05:32:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You did good, I meant to say."

05:32:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Reapers are scary in large numbers."

05:32:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you ever do face a large group, your best bet is to slowly back away from them while firing. That way, you expose yourself to as few drills as possible while you whittle them down."

05:33:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oof, alright. I'm going to get up to some serious paperwork for a bit."

05:33:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be back in a couple hours."

05:37:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Reaches cleared of RATS as well."

05:37:17 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person torpedo boat "Prince Of Pain".

05:45:30 Lileah Rose kisses you.

05:45:55 Lileah Rose says to you, "nite sweet man. I love you too."

05:46:02 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

05:56:04 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

06:01:18 You have been idle too long.  Have a lovely evening.
    * You have been disconnected. Please come back soon. *

06:15:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Looks like things are relatively clear out there."

06:15:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nice."

06:15:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Almost done this mining op."

06:23:47 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

06:27:50 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

06:27:50 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

06:43:18 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hey Tara?"

06:43:23 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah?"

06:43:30 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Did you get my letter?"

06:43:59 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I havent been to the office. Dealing with some interdiction right now."

06:44:10 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Will check soon."

06:44:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "All the zany interdiction."

06:44:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I might need some help. Orions belt."

06:44:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Coming."

06:45:17 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Need help?"

06:48:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They jump out?"

06:48:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah."

06:52:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That bolt thrower must have knocked out my jump drive."

06:53:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're almost thre Tara."

06:53:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks."

06:53:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No problem. Losing sensors is a real pain."

06:54:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, where are you?"

06:54:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm tugging her in to new Earth right now."

06:54:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

06:54:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Pirates knocked my sensors out."

06:58:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wow. Now theres RATS at orion."

06:58:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Three heavy fighters. Want to take them on, Dakhal?"

06:58:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm already on my way."

07:01:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also tara?"

07:01:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Huh?"

07:02:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I give you mad props for taking on pirates in a hauler."

07:02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's hardcore."

07:03:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

07:03:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know you weren't really trying to fight them, but that was pretty rough going for the interdictors while under fire."

07:03:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "Well, I had to put Rhino through her paces." Tara Flores laughs. "Wnated to see how her new armor plating would hold up.'"

07:04:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah. They picked up on what I was doing and knocked out my sensors, then my turret."

07:05:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I swear that bolt thrower is the one I chased off in 777."

07:07:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "RATS are gone."

07:08:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks. I'm in a sector to the east. Some sizeable comets here."

07:10:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It might have been the same Thrower, for sure."

07:10:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The pirates will often jump out before their ships explode, so it's not uncommon to run into the same ones, over and over until someone gets lucky and takes out a ship before it can jump."

07:11:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Do only the pirates have access to bolt throwers?"

07:11:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, they're available on Endymion."

07:11:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sounds like prime equipment for keeping them in the system."

07:12:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And once you have enough points, you can actually install the bolt cannons on anything, save one or two exceptions I think."

07:12:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, no it won't keep them there. They use temp drives just like we do."

07:13:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. ok, I take that back. It is possible to hit them with a bolt and cause their drive to seize for a moment, in which case they won't be able to amke even the temp jump."

07:14:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Always have a temp drive bolted in your engineering room. I know some folks like to wait until they need them, but there's not really a reason to do that. I just always have one bolted,  just in case."

07:14:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Temp drives aren't used unless they're needed, yeah?"

07:15:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, I didn't even stop to check out that outfit you mentioned, Tara."

07:15:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

07:15:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

07:20:58 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I guess I should figure out something to do."

07:21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I think that the torps they've been selling me just aren't all that great. Heavy fighters take two, but I've heard that they should really only take one."

07:21:09 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Okay, that's just scary."

07:21:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sitting here drinking ale and eating nachos just isn't cutting it."

07:21:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's scary, Eve?"

07:21:49 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I was just about to say the same fuckin' thing."

07:23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It might be the launcher and not the torps."

07:23:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have you upgraded it at all?"

07:24:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What does strength effect? On grapples?"

07:24:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The higher the grapple strength, the faster the chunk will fall apart into pieces."

07:24:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's my favorite grapple characteristic."

07:25:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I basically only use mighty grapples."

07:25:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, so you can then salvage the smaller parts with the EMM?"

07:25:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Exactly."

07:25:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hmmmm. I've been using fine toothed grapples. I think fine tooth is good for things like comets, but mighty is good for shipwrecks."

07:25:51 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

07:26:43 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Johann."

07:27:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "He just crashed for the day. Can I help you with something?"

07:27:25 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, if you see him tell him I probably wont be able to make it."

07:27:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ah damn."

07:27:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I suggested you, myself."

07:28:10 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "As much as I want to go I'll probably be busy that day."

07:28:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. The trip will be out for more than just a day. It's a proper exploration trip. As long as they can get you on the ship..."

07:29:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's ok if you are asleep for parts of it, those trips can run for oever a week a lot of the time."

07:30:07 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah. We'll see! Might be able to get aboard on friday, or early saturday."

07:30:25 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Johann would send you a key, so that you could board early."

08:16:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Three hundred industry!"

08:20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

08:25:52 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

08:31:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man."

08:32:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys want to do anything?"

08:32:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Gladly?"

08:32:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe a nest? The rats have sort of been a thorn in our side tonight."

08:32:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, im about to buy some stuff at the torus."

08:33:03 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nest?"

08:33:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Are you saying that you're somehow fertile, and are looking for a nesting partner?"

08:34:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, no."

08:34:11 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean I wish I could say that."

08:36:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So, no nest for us."

08:36:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are beacons, tesla sites."

08:36:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I could go for a beacon."

08:36:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, beacons."

08:36:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im up for a becon. Wheres the autovector sold on the torus, though?"

08:37:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Look in the xenology research thingamabob place."

08:37:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forget its true name."

08:37:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's the right name."

08:37:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's located in the northeast."

08:37:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

08:37:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's the right name."

08:37:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's called the xenology thingamabob place."

08:37:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "For all your thingamabob needs."

08:38:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They also sell hot dogs."

08:38:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Darn I don't have the credits for the autovector. Tempted to take a loan."

08:38:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For some reason."

08:38:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's like, super weird that they sell hotdogs now."

08:38:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You could always mine again."

08:38:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're allowed two mining sites a day."

08:41:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Upgraded my scouts battery. It lasts for a day and six hours now."

08:41:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

08:41:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Also got the navaid and jet."

08:41:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome!"

08:41:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We should go artifacting."

08:42:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Lets do that Beacon, Yeah? Dakhal's waiting."

08:42:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure."

08:42:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli, you don't want a beacon, do you?"

08:42:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm."

08:43:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rub is that none of the three of us can engineer on my clipper."

08:43:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well I guess I could, but my energy dumps are really weak."

08:43:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Say are you all beaconed out?"

08:43:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."

08:45:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I'll come, and I can bring an engineer."

08:45:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I found one, just laying around in the spaceport."

08:45:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Some sort of coat thief."

08:46:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

08:46:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "If I had tried to recharge my battery to full at the processor, Con, it would have taken three hours with the upgrade."

08:46:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, trickle charging can be slow."

08:47:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if you're doing multi-day artifacting out at 777 or something, it's fine."

09:20:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 8,703,703.70 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person pulsar "Black Sunshine".

09:48:33 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nice beaconing folks."

09:48:41 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah it was!"

09:48:49 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Don't remind me of ducts, please."

09:50:04 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So where is this place, Eve? 185?"

09:50:50 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Good night!"

09:50:59 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good night."

09:51:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damnit Even, you ran off with my coat again."

09:51:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

10:01:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll be able to get some new lasers soon."

10:02:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's awesome!"

10:02:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I should probably upgrade my grid when I replace those. I already drain this one with the stock turrets."

10:03:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You definitely should upgrade your grid."

10:19:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hmmm. Tiny little nap for 20 minutes I think."

10:25:53 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

11:19:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Something about scooping hydrogen is relaxing."

11:19:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I love scooping."

11:20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We'll have to chat about it some time. Heck, I'd be willing to explore to find new gas giants."

11:20:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm going to crash for now though. Hopefully not into the surface of a planet. Or 'roid."

11:21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

11:21:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have a good night."

11:29:53 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

13:27:38 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:27:39 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go down and out.

13:46:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:46:10 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:46:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Critical Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

13:46:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:46:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:46:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:46:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

14:34:45 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

14:34:46 You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

14:34:46 There is 1 player connected:

14:34:47 Rolando Caganda  (A)                                 

14:34:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

14:34:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

14:34:52 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

14:34:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

14:34:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:35:04 There is nothing nearby with which to dock.

14:35:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:35:07 I don't understand that.

14:35:08    Planets:

14:35:08 [1] New Earth

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

14:35:08 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

14:35:10 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

14:35:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

14:35:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

14:35:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

14:51:43 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'thirty minutes.'"

15:05:50 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

15:10:51 You have been idle too long.  Have a lovely evening.
    * You have been disconnected. Please come back soon. *

15:26:33 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:26:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:31:56 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

15:50:41 There appear to be about 10 pilots recently active.

16:38:56 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:38:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:38:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:38:58 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:39:01 You peer out...

16:39:01 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

16:39:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:39:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:39:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:39:17 The ship is already moving.

16:39:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:39:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:39:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:39:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:39:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:39:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:39:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:39:27 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:39:27 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:39:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:39:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:39:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:39:32 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:39:34 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

16:39:35 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

16:40:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:40:05 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:40:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:40:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:40:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:40:26 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:40:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:40:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:54:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:54:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:54:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:54:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:55:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:55:39 The computer announces, "Searching for sector beacon."

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a gray leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and Shule Elemmire's workbench here.
You can go south and out.

17:15:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.

Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

17:15:45 There is little point in launching, since the ship is already in space.

17:15:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:15:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:15:55 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

17:15:57 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:15:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:16:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:16:03 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Kalliste, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

17:18:14 The shuddering finally settles down.

17:18:19 The computer announces, "Skim initialization complete."

17:21:59 The computer announces, "Skim complete; starship has arrived at journey destination."

17:22:13 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Farport. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:22:13 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:22:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector W-62."

17:22:16 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:22:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:22:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:47:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey guys."

17:54:19 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Dalmatian Pelican". The organization has earned 938,451.74 credits.

17:58:30 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]

17:58:30 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
You can go south and out.

17:58:34 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:58:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:58:35 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:58:35 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:58:36 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

17:58:38 There are 2 players connected:

17:58:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

17:58:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:58:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:59:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

17:59:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:59:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:59:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:59:21 I don't understand that.

18:08:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

18:08:30 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

18:08:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:08:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm going to go make a patrol of our sectors and then see about doing some scooping. I'd be interested in artifacting, but I don't have any jets."

18:08:35 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

18:08:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:08:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:08:40 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an old engine casing.

18:11:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:11:33 You say to Lileah Rose, "Hi love."

18:11:34 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

18:11:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:29:25 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

18:29:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:29:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Those both belong to Angelica Torres."

18:29:38 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

18:29:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't believe I've ever had the pleasure."

18:29:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:29:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, Ok. I thought as much. I don't believe she's been active in a very long time."

18:30:03 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

18:30:22 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

18:30:26 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

18:30:31 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of industrial slag.

18:30:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright Dak, I'm just hanging in the lounge."

18:30:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whenever you're ready."

18:31:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's likely another cuirser that hasn't been refitted, as well."

18:31:06 You say to Lileah Rose, "I need to go for a bit. I'll be back later."

18:31:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

18:31:13 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

18:31:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:31:17 Scanning reveals no nearby debris.

18:31:18 Lileah Rose asks, "ok you going to turn in your debris?"

18:31:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:31:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:31:50 Lileah Rose says, "ok"

18:31:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm on my way now."

18:31:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:32:00 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:32:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:32:03 You kiss Lileah Rose.

18:32:07 Lileah Rose kisses you.

20:47:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm making the scooping station."

20:47:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, wait on that."

20:47:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Have you bought the scoop part yet?"

20:47:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah I did."

20:47:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Did we want a better one."

20:48:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think it'd be better if we waitinged to get the better one. We're only 20 command points away,."

20:48:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

20:48:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What should I do with the one I bought?"

20:49:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ummm, not much we can do with it."

20:49:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry, I was going to tell you to wait, but I thought there was more time left on this scooping station."

20:49:49 Not much to see out there.

20:49:54 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

20:49:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

20:49:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries. I'm sorry I wasted the credits."

20:49:56 [Starship "Kalliste"; Storage Room]

20:49:56 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" here.
You can go north and south.

20:50:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the megacredit."

20:50:09 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

20:50:09 You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

20:50:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's ok. I'll ask Lily what we should do with it when she gets backj."

20:50:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:50:33 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:50:35 You peer out...

20:50:35 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person medium transport "Kalliste" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

20:50:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:50:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:50:40 [Starship "Kalliste"; Airlock]

20:50:40 You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:50:40 You exit the ship.

20:58:44 [Starship "Sandbagger"; Control Room]
The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see an FTL drive tracer, a sector debris scanner, a large beanbag chair, and a large leather lounge couch here.
Lileah Rose is asleep.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a large leather lounge couch.)

20:58:44 Lileah Rose suddenly awakens.

20:58:45 There are 2 players connected:

20:58:46 Rolando Caganda  (A)      Lileah Rose  (A)           

20:58:57 You grin at Lileah Rose.

20:58:58 Lileah Rose kisses you.

20:59:00 You kiss Lileah Rose.

20:59:17 I don't understand that.

20:59:24 You say, "ok, off to salvage some more."

20:59:27 You grin.

20:59:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:59:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:59:30 Lileah Rose whistles.

20:59:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:59:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:59:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:59:41 Lileah Rose grins at you.

20:59:46 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

20:59:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:59:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

20:59:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:59:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:00:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

21:00:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:00:08 Lileah Rose presses a button, calling up a display of the contents of the ship's hold.

21:00:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:00:48 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:00:53 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:00:58 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an old engine casing.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:01:03 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

21:01:05 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:01:25 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:01:34 You say, "The problem is, I have no idea where the Jinu trade ship is."

21:01:41 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:01:46 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:01:51 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a detached hull plate.

21:01:53 Lileah Rose says, "oh yeah well guess you will just have to look for it"

21:01:56 You nod.

21:15:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:16:01 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:16:04 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

21:16:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

21:16:06 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:16:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:16:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:16:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:16:11 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of radium.

21:16:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:16:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:16:14 Lileah Rose kisses you.

21:16:22 Lileah Rose cuddles up to you.

21:16:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:16:42 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Sup guys?"

21:16:58 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

21:17:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Five jumps to The Drift Funnel. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:17:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:17:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Borderlands."

21:17:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeeaaaaahhh booiiiiiiie."

21:17:05 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:17:06 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

21:17:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:17:09 Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates a solar system may also be in this cluster.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Four jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:17:10 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Tuxtla Territories."

21:17:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:17:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:17:15 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:17:15 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Candelaria Orbit."

21:17:16 You kiss Lileah Rose.

21:17:16 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:17:18 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

21:17:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:17:20 You cuddle up to Lileah Rose.

21:17:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

21:17:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:17:25 A beacon has been placed trailing the orbit of Candelaria, a waypoint on the way to and from deeper space.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:17:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:17:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Drift Funnel."

21:17:27 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:17:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:17:30 This beacon lies along the path of the local solar system's galactic orbit. Dust and debris has been pulled in its wake, leaving a funnel-shaped void.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

21:27:29 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.
(You are lying down.)

21:27:30 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:30:05 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach gasps.

21:30:08 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:30:13 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a drifting cloud of tritium.

21:30:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:30:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:30:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:30:21 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:30:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:30:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:30:24 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:30:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:30:26 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

21:30:26 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:30:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's no wonder I didn't recognize the name of that transport. I've never seen it salvage!"

21:30:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:30:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:30:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:30:29 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:30:31 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

21:30:32 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Kalliste! Welcome to home space!"

21:30:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:30:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:31:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm. I definitely looked at the org asset list before the station shut down, and we still had 980 then."

21:31:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:31:21 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:31:22 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:31:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalliste. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:31:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:31:27 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:31:32 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a single spacesuit glove.

21:31:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:31:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:31:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:31:39 [Starship "Kalliste"; Airlock]

21:31:40 You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:31:40 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person medium transport "Kalliste" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

21:31:42 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office]

21:31:42 You see a friendly cadet orientation officer here.
You can go north, up, and out.

21:31:42 [Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Pilot Organization Level]

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

21:36:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Really? Oh, do we get notified of other scoops going down too?"

21:36:25 You kiss Lileah Rose.

21:36:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:36:41 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I have landed."

21:36:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:37:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We do. As long as it has an AEU core on it."

21:37:06 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

21:37:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

21:37:09 Which sector did you mean?

Enter your selection:

21:37:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:37:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:37:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, geez. What a dummy. Sorry about that."

21:37:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:37:14 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:37:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:37:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:37:18 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

21:37:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:37:23 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:37:23 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:37:25 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Kalliste! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:37:28 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:37:33 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a detached sensor component.

21:38:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:38:27 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:38:29 I don't understand that.

21:38:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:38:32 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:38:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons, Dak?"

21:38:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:38:36 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:38:37 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of gold.

21:38:47 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:38:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:38:48 You scramble to your feet.

21:39:35 Constantine Stone says, "Well, so far, just us."

21:39:47 You say, "Ok, sec. I'll be right back then. Sorry."

21:39:50 You key in a transport of Kalliste to your location.

21:39:50 The two-person medium transport "Kalliste" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

21:40:45 You're already there.

21:40:47 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:40:50 You smile at Lileah Rose.

21:40:52 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:40:55 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "1 more for a gunship."

21:40:58 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of titanium.

21:40:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:40:59 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:41:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalliste. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:41:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:41:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:41:15 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:41:15 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:41:16 You scramble to your feet.

21:41:17 [Starship "Kalliste"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:41:17 You exit the ship.

You can go south, up, and out.

21:41:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:41:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:41:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:41:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:41:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:41:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thought we only had three so far?"

21:41:36 The ship is already moving.

21:41:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:41:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I thought we could undercrew a gunship with four."

21:41:41 Which sector did you mean?

Enter your selection:

21:41:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:41:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:41:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:41:47 Your ship 'Kalliste' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:41:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:41:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:41:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:41:51 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:41:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

21:41:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:41:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go north and down.

22:31:34 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:31:34 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.
Constantine Stone says into the PA microphone, "Well I'm in no rush."

22:31:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:31:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:31:39 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

22:31:41 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:31:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
Constantine Stone is standing here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:31:47 [The Torus; Garage]

22:31:47 You can go up.
Constantine Stone followed you.

22:31:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach sighs. "That's because we've been feeding the ship for you."

22:31:50 Constantine Stone says, "We can wait and try to do a bigger one later if you want."

22:31:51 [Starship "Striking Distance"; Airlock]

22:31:51 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Constantine Stone followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:31:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They did indeed starve."

22:32:06 You say, "Yeah, let's then."

22:32:08 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:32:08 Constantine Stone nods.

22:32:10 You say, "Let's wait."

22:32:14 You disband your group.

22:32:18 Constantine Stone says, "Didn't catch that."

22:32:21 Constantine Stone removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a dark orange flightbag with a white lightning bolt on the side.

22:32:22 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "Shhhhhhhhhhht! Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht! Shhhhhhhhhhhhhhhht!"

22:32:32 You say, "Let's wait and do a bigger one later."

22:33:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And again I ask, why do people give felo to cadets?"

22:33:07 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "She just said they've been trying to feed the felo for you."

22:33:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Tara, remember when you named your virtual ship Taraiscool."

22:33:10 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause people were doing -your- work and feeding -your- animals when they emptied the troughs at the time you filled them, sounds like."

22:33:13 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Because they starved before eve or whoever filled the ship."

22:33:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I keep thinking of that and laughing."

22:33:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hah! Yeah?"

22:33:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That was great."

22:33:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That is because. We have been feeding the ship from the repair and rearm. Hoping we could save some."

22:33:50 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "Shit! Son of a blah blah blah!"

22:34:22 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "My god.. shit... shit... shit..."

22:34:23 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Generally, depending on the size of the ship, troughs tend to only stay full for 1-3 days."

22:34:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That also took longer than expected."

22:34:49 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "This is."

22:34:55 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I don't give felo to cadets, for exactly this reason."

22:35:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's crap yes. It's shit. Definitely. But we did our best to do the work for you. That you apparently couldn't be bothered doing."

22:36:32 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "Ah, crap, well, f...k, f...k, f...k, s...t, b....h, c..p, a..e."

22:36:43 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "We get it."

22:36:55 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "I know."

22:37:10 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "We get it, you're sad or mad or both because you fucked up. Let this be a lesson to you."

22:37:19 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wait, what did you do, Sarah?"

22:37:41 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "Long story."

22:37:47 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "Realy not long, but."

22:38:17 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Not really. She let felo starve on a ship and couldn't be bothered to fill up their trof. There, the honest and cold truth."

22:38:40 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "Oh, that's the problem, I'll be thought as a total a hole."

22:38:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aww."

22:39:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:39:07 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "That doesn't even hit the dot."

22:39:12 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im sure people are willing to forgive if you just learn from it and don't make the same mistake, you know?"

22:39:21 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "If it helps, I don't think you're an asshole. I'm frankly indifferent!"

22:39:24 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I'm not pissed off and I don't think your an ass hole. I'm just... slightly... a little... um... unhappy with te chain of events."

22:40:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "As Anfisa would say, "Unfortunate""

22:40:15 [General Communication] Sarah Zenovas transmits, "Hmm, how about something to smash, eh? How about a piece of scrap lieing here, nice."

22:57:24 You're already there.

22:57:26 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

22:57:30 You kiss Lileah Rose.

22:57:31 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

22:57:36 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a drifting cloud of tritium.

22:57:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh but Ather. There's apparently this really detailed space part we didn't know about."

23:03:08 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:03:13 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

23:03:26 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

23:03:31 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:03:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:03:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:11:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:11:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:11:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:11:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:11:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:11:24 The ship is already moving.

23:11:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:11:26 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:11:27 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:11:30 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:11:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:11:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:11:33 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

23:13:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:13:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:13:22 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On my way."

23:13:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:13:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:13:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:13:40 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Where are we gathering?"

23:13:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:13:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:13:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

23:13:52 [Tactical Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Old earth."

23:13:53 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:13:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:13:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:13:57 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:13:58 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

His head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" in his right hand.

23:18:09 Lexie Amarras says, "Never mind, just teasing shule."

23:18:30 Lexie Amarras says, "Oh that reminds me, before we leave Shule after the nest I need to show you what your kindness caused."

23:18:30 Nathaniel Owens asks, "About?"

23:18:35 You say, "Don't worry."

23:18:40 You say, "Don't worry about it."

23:18:47 Lexie Amarras says, "Yeah, it'd take too long to explain."

23:18:52 You laugh.

23:23:26 [Starship "Second Chances"; Engineering Room]

23:23:26 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a temporary wormhole drive and a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough here.
You can go north and south.

23:23:27 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

23:55:26 [Aerial Fortress "Mastersun Striker"; Deployment]

23:55:26 Lexie Amarras is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, and northwest.

23:55:29 Lexie Amarras presses a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a Fringe Legionnaire from storage and sets it in front of her.

23:55:30 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

23:55:36 You can't go that way.

23:55:37 Lexie Amarras presses a button on a Fringe Legionnaire, which splits open down the front. She carefully climbs inside.

23:55:39 Two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend from the ceiling and close around Lexie Amarras (Fringe Legionnaire). The sealed drop pod is quickly hauled into position at the launch tube, then disappears at a high rate of speed.

23:55:39 You press a prominent button, and a crane promptly retrieves a Fringe Hunter from storage and sets it in front of you.

23:55:39 An assembly of robotic arms descends from the ceilings, rapidly reloading the battlesuit's weapons.

23:55:42 A beep from the computer indicates that the aerial fortress is now completely repaired.

23:55:43 You tongue a prominent control inside your battlesuit, then brace yourself as two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial fortress.

23:55:43 (20 seconds roundtime.)

23:56:03 The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

23:56:03 (20 seconds roundtime.)

23:56:23 With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing you.

23:56:23 [RATS Nest; Drop Point] (inside a battlesuit)
This is just inside a location where the nest is open to space. Before you extends a series of tunnels, which are strangely organic-looking, yet clearly crafted from metal.
You see Lexie Amarras (Fringe Legionnaire) here.
You can go east.

23:56:32 You grin at Lexie Amarras.

23:56:39 Lexie Amarras says, "Well that's two."

23:56:41 Lexie Amarras grins.

23:56:43 You say, "Yep."

23:56:44 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Nathaniel Owens (League Infantryman).

23:56:48 A drop pod suddenly hurtles into the area, slowing its descent abruptly with a burst of thrust, then hitting the ground and immediately peeling open, revealing Egil Aurstad (AEU Light Combatant).

23:56:49 Lexie Amarras says, "Nice to feel like I know what's going on."

23:56:53 You grin.

23:57:29 Lexie Amarras asks, "Who's the damage suit you nate?"

23:57:34 Nathaniel Owens says, "Sorry for not informing you of what's going on. I don't normally have time to talk, it's like I say go or don't bother."

23:57:41 Nathaniel Owens says, "Yeah."

23:57:43 Lexie Amarras nods.

23:57:52 You say, "Nathaniel is leading."

23:57:59 You say, "I just aim, shoot, miss."

23:58:04 Egil Aurstad smiles.

23:58:05 You say, "Rince and repeat."

23:58:06 Nathaniel Owens says to Egil Aurstad, "You have buttons and stuff done, right?"

23:58:08 Lexie Amarras nods.

23:58:14 Lexie Amarras says, "Mobile laser thingy."

23:58:15 Egil Aurstad says, "I have."

23:58:17 Lexie Amarras says, "Just one."

23:58:21 You nod.

23:58:23 You peer east...

23:58:23 
[RATS Nest Interior] (inside a battlesuit)
This is the interior of the nest. There is no light here save that provided by battlesuit torches. Tunnels twist here and there, many too small for you to navigate. The walls possess a manufactured regularity, while the layout seems organic and unpredictable.
You see Mobile Laser-Equipped Sentry Alpha here.
You can go east and west.

23:58:25 Nathaniel Owens says to Lexie Amarras, "You do the same. Aim, shoot, and miss. Your fringe, it's what your best at."

23:58:31 You grin.

23:58:33 Lexie Amarras says, "Heh I hit baby. I hit."

23:58:50 You say, "Need a moment please."

23:58:53 Lexie Amarras nods.

23:59:00 Nathaniel Owens says to Lexie Amarras, "Um, talk to shuel. Your can hit it off in this next room."

23:59:12 You chuckle at Nathaniel Owens.

23:59:13 Lexie Amarras nods.

23:59:15 You say, "Sec."
