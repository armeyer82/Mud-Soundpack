01:03 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in AEU/Debate.

01:03 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

01:07 [Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]

01:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, a bright orange crate, and a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow.

Introduction:
This book details all of the upgrades and ships that the AEU can get from their own planets and from other planets and stations. Everything has its own special section (see table of contents on the next page). If you're ever confused by anything or think that it's missing from the book, feel free to check the additional info available at most ship upgrade stores. Should you believe that there's anything that I missed, or which you think might be wrong, feel free to mail me about it so that it can be corrected in a future edition. Don't tell me about it on comms, I will more than likely miss it if you do.

Note: this book will contain only starship statistics and class modifications. The descriptions advertising these ships shown in stores will not be included. I will offer a brief and in some instances, a more detailed descriptions of starships and capabilities. The class modifications are mostly combat-oriented, but I have tried to include them for all vessels since people have requested this in the past. Furthermore, please note that I did not include pricing for application starships, this is intentional. Keep checking back for updated editions!

Tracking Arrays:
ITERATIVE TARGET TRACKER (Endymion)
Requirements: 0 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 70%

COALITION STANDARD TT ARRAY MK II (Drydock)
Requirements: 0 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%

CHETUMAL ORBITAL DEFENSE STANDARD TT ARRAY (Bikura)
Requirements: 20 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 100%

EAOS FIBER OPTIC TT ARRAY MK I (bikura)
Requirements: 300 combat points
Maximum Targets: 2 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 100%

LUNA IMPROVED TT ARRAY (Endymion)
Requirements: 600 combat points
Maximum Targets: 1 Range: 2 units Near Target Retention: 100% Far Target Retention: 50%

FRINGE NAVAL MASSIVELY PARALLEL TT ARRAY (endymion)
Requirements: 700 combat points
Maximum Targets: 3 Range: 1 unit Near Target Retention: 75%

Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement information and send that information to your gunners.

Tracking arrays are used by pilots who like using the vector locking method against their enemies. The pilot basically tracks the target he wants to go after, so that his gunners or himself can keep an eye on where the target is going at all times and keep locks on it. Target retention is used to keep track of how often an enemy starship that's being tracked moves. The higher the target retention is, the faster your tracking array will update with enemy movement information and send that information to your gunners.

12:57 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

12:57 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Bikura Spaceport; Landing Pad.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.

13:38 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

13:38 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

16:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pete Storm transmits, "I'm looking for a place called drydock which is mentioned in the upgrades book."

16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pete Storm transmits, "It's not in the destination finder."

16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pete Storm transmits, "Any help appreciated."

16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You just just jump to it."

16:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You can just jump to it."

16:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pete Storm transmits, "Ah so this is the place, ok thanks."

16:19 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:19 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

16:19 The sensor systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

16:19 I don't understand that.

16:19 You scramble to your feet.

16:19 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:19 You exit the ship.

16:19 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

16:19 Board what?

16:19 [The Torus; Garage]

16:19 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

16:43 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pete Storm transmits, "Ok I'm heading to the lounge pretty soon."

16:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:43 The computer reports that the two-person heavy launch vessel "Registered Merchant 661" has jumped into the sector.

16:43 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 661! Welcome to The Torus!"

16:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

16:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:43 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:43 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:43 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

16:43 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

16:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:44 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:44 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Dark Amen" has landed on the planet New Earth.

16:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:44 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Yo."

16:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:44 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:45 Pete Storm says, "Love the ship name."

16:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:45 You disband your group.

16:45 Pete Storm smiles.

16:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:46 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Steel Phoenix Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:46 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:46 Pete Storm asks, "Where is your weapons room?"

16:46 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Steel Phoenix Command."

16:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:46 The unusual but striking shape of the Steel Phoenix Command Station floats here, a large structure of darkened steel.

16:46 Shule Elemmire points to the east.

16:46 Via general sector communication, Steel Phoenix Command transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

16:46 Pete Storm walks east.

16:46 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

16:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:46 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do I need to do damage control in here as well?"

16:46 The starship transitions into another sector.

16:46 Via general sector communication, AEU Battle-Scanning Solar Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There are currently no active decoy beacons in surrounding sectors."

16:47 The starship transitions into another sector.

16:47 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

17:01 I don't understand that.

17:01 You lift a small plastic cover and press a green button.

17:01 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

17:01 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Good work."

17:01 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks, found reading the damage difficult during that."

17:02 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yeah, it can be a bit tough. But it's a good thing to practice."

17:02 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, good fun though."

17:03 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just always aware that it's someone elses ship."

17:05 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yeah, but you know what? I'd have to fall asleep here to have this ship blown up in a beacon so don't worry about it. Just work on damage as much as you can and then gun. I'm gunning from within the CR too."

17:05 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok."

17:06 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "And on that note, if you do have any questions regarding space combat, feel free to ask me."

17:06 I see no "beacon" in a leather briefcase.

17:06 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ok, is there a knack to reading the coordinates quickly?"

17:06 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Coordinates for what?"

17:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:07 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

17:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:07 A small light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches on, while a similar light next to the word MANUAL switches off.

17:07 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I mean so you get a vague idea of where the ships are around you from your coords."

17:07 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Oh, press the "ships" button."

17:07 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "But I use vector locking so."

17:08 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

17:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:08 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:08 Pete Storm's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do you use the starmap or the rundown."

17:08 Via general sector communication, AEU Battle-Scanning Solar Temporary Station transmits, "Greetings. There are currently no active decoy beacons in surrounding sectors."

17:08 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I use the rundown."

17:08 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (20, 10, 9)

17:08 The starship transitions into another sector.

17:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

17:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:09 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:09 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

17:09 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Sorry, I only have time for that one. I can probably do more later."

17:09 Pete Storm walks in from the east.

17:09 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:09 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

17:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:09 Pete Storm smiles.

17:09 Pete Storm says, "Sure I appreciate it."

17:09 You smile.

17:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:09 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:10 Pete Storm asks, "Does the ship need to be still to get a track on it?"

17:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

17:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:10 You are credited with 4,271,255.06 AEU credits of bounty.
640,688.26 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

17:10 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:10 You say, "Nope."

17:10 Pete Storm says, "I been finding it difficult to track even when I seem to be 1 unit away."

17:10 You say, "Hmmm, it depends on what tracking array you have on your ship. This one does a good job."

17:11 Pete Storm says, "Ah that makes sense."

17:11 Pete Storm says, "Well thanks and good to meet you."

17:11 You say, "Good to meet you too and no problem."

17:11 Pete Storm grins.

17:11 Pete Storm waves.

17:11 You wave.

17:11 Pete Storm says, "See you latyer."

17:11 You say, "See ya."

17:11 Pete Storm walks out.

17:11 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

17:11 You peer out...

17:11 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
Pete Storm is standing here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

17:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:11 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

17:11 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:11 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]

17:11 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go west.

17:11 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

17:11 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:11 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Storage Room]

17:11 You see a simple cardboard box labeled 'Kaise, Lily', ten of a fractured processing unit, nine of a part of a ship-to-ship chain, forty-two of an intact hull plate, three of a portion of a wormhole drive, forty-one of an interior panel, forty-two of an unidentifiable starship component, eleven of a landing gear strut, four of a hydraulic assembly, and an Outsider sensor construct of some kind here.
You can go northwest.

17:12 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

17:12 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:12 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

17:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Pete Storm transmits, "I have a bari spreader releasing spores in the dusty reaches."

17:52 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You guys get Borderlands taken care of?"

17:53 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Yes."

17:53 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. I was workin on Accord, EAOS, and unclaimed, made it through Tesla and went to get Elaine."

17:53 [Tactical Communication] Arielle Night transmits, "Anything I can help with?"

17:53 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I didn't-t-t-t quit-t-t-te make it-t-t-t t-t-t-through Fringe sectors."

17:54 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Shule. Are you able to comb AEU sectors for bari?"

18:10 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

18:17 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "AEU seems clear."

18:20 *** Shutting down: OH GOD OH GOD WE'RE ALL GOING TO DIE ***
