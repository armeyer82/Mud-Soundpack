-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

02:17 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It's actually going quite well."

02:18 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It's still a bit early, but I'll give a more concrete report when I'm done with it."

02:30 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "So far, they've stolen 107 metals from me, which is more than I'm use to. Usually I don't get more than 100 metals stolen from me for an entire site. However, I've collected 304 of their metals."

02:30 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "We'll have to see how the ratio is at the end of the site."

02:30 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Yes, but I want it to be a sweeping win, not just a win! Go big or go home, and all."

02:31 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "If I can keep the number from getting to 200 metals, it'll be a win."

02:31 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Cause I'm hoping for 1000 plus poacher metals."

02:32 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And I've not had any overlapping waves of attacks, by the way. Usually they're destroyed in 5-10 minutes tops."

02:32 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I hope so!"

02:33 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I'm reasonably confident in my formation of defense turrets."

02:33 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "This is only my second metal-rich asteroid."

02:37 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "OK, another attack just started. Let's mark the time."

02:37 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Not an attack attack."

02:37 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "A mining attack."

02:44 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Time marked. That took 7 minutes."

02:45 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Got over 100 metals and lost uh, 19."

02:45 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I've definitely lost no metals, yes."

02:45 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Harder to do on metal-rich asteroids, but not so hard to do on rocky asteroids, comets or radio active ones."

02:46 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Well, honestly, placement is everything."

02:48 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Why aren't you maxing out your defense turrets and putting up that last chaingun and sharpshooter?"

02:49 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "You can have a total of 10 defense implacements."

02:49 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And 20000 metal sites are definitely worth maxing out your defense turrets for, in my opinion. Maybe not 36 drones, but definitely 10 defense implacements."

02:50 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "What level of mining upgrades are you at?"

02:51 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And belatedly Cheri: mining does require you to think, especially during the initial setup process. You have to be adaptible based on the sites you get, even occasionally changing the order of researching around. So I agree with you in that it can definitely be interesting! After that setup process though, you can pretty much just vege out and let your drones do the work while you read a book or something."

02:51 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And yes, 36 drones is when you max out all routing arrays, relays and towers."

02:52 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Licenses aside Kert, what level of mining upgrades are you on? Metals, building reclamation, drone reclamation, research etc."

02:53 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I sometimes fucking hate the default panel placement. I wish they would just keep them as outlyers."

02:54 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Like 3, 3? Why there, whyyyyy!?"

02:54 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "That shit happened to me just this afternoon."

02:55 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "That's not too bad. You're cruising right along."

02:55 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Yep."

02:56 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It only gets mega annoying when it's right in the way of where you want to put your first drill site or processor."

02:57 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Then you have to build a second panel in the right spot, then destroy the interloper, then you can start to build out your site."

02:59 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I'm not going to lie to you, at 20000 metals I was already starting to build 36 drones. People use to think I was crazy, but well, there we were."

02:59 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I was getting 95-96% conversions, and they were still in the eighties."

03:00 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "So who's the crazy one!?"

03:00 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I wouldn't do all that."

03:01 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But I do only have one processor built; an enhanced ore processor."

03:01 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But, I have 4 drills and 2 borers."

03:02 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Kert, if you're going to stay on the lower end of the number of drones built, you're going to need to halt operations at every attack so your drones can defend instead."

03:02 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Between 43-44000, and a bit under 5 hours."

03:02 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And yes, I know it can be finished in less time if I built more processors."

03:02 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But I'm usually doing stuff while the site is running."

03:03 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "It was about 53000 today actually."

03:05 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Yeah, replicator doesn't count, because your drones aren't always operating it."

03:10 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I've used guard drones before."

03:10 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "They're more trouble than they're worth. You end up spending the metals to research all the way up to them, then build the building, then waste the time and the additional metals to upgrade your drones to guard drones, which can't carry as many metals as basic drones."

03:11 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And in my opinion, they're still not able to defend the site on their own without defensive implacements."

03:12 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "People will usually just tell you "don't do this it's a bad idea." I on the other hand, tell you -why- iI- think it's a bad idea."

03:13 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "But yes, there are some drastically different methods of setting up mining sites. Liam use to set his up in a unique way which got him done with it in around 3 or so hours, but he ended up losing a lot of his conversion because of the way he does it. Johann seems to do a similar style to Liam's."

03:13 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Megapod?"

03:13 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Granted, with so many metals on asteroids at highe rmining levels, you lose less and less of that conversion."

03:14 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Shallow, perhaps?"

03:14 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Depends on the group, I have no problem."

03:14 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I haven't done my deep yet, but I don't need deeps so."

03:14 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "I did my deep. I'lll help out any team that needs help out."

03:14 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Wow, people already did deep assaults in the last two or so hours?"

03:15 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone else?"

03:15 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Oh woo, only lost 15 metals in that last attack, and up to 600 metals from poacher wrecks. This is really really good so far."

03:16 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Kinda need one more, would be helpful."

03:16 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Well, I have a lot of things maxed out. 36 drones, 10 defense implacements."

03:16 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And strategic placement of my defense turrets."

03:17 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I actually have one chaingun and one sharpshooter within two units of my coordinator from two different directions."

03:17 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Then I set up an outward perimeter of chainguns and sharpshooters, putting chainguns in areas that might overlap slightly with the sharpshooters so that there can be more concentrated fire power."

03:18 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Then I have some outlyer sharpshooters and chainguns."

03:18 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Those are like, the scout turrets that pick things off from farther away as they're approaching the coordinator."

03:18 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "My snipers, if you will."

03:18 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "If not megapod maybe a nest or something."

03:18 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Have myself, and one other that haven't done our pods yet."

03:18 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Nest nest whee."

03:19 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Woo."

03:19 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "So michael and kert and another person."

03:19 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "It's jada and I, and I think bryan wanted?"

03:19 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Bryan and jada both want shallows."

03:20 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Michael and I have bari suits already so not doing deeps won't hurt much."

03:20 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Ok then."

03:20 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "We can do that."

03:22 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Where we meetingh."

03:22 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "We are meeting at chetumal, bryan and the others?"

03:23 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "What do you want me in?"

03:23 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Yeah, gotta sort suits."

03:23 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Who has what."

03:23 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "For me eaos, league, bari or rental, all tier 2."

03:23 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "I have eaos 3."

03:23 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "For 3s, I have league, bari, muti, AEU, and eaos."

03:23 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Get that bryan."

03:24 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "League, michael."

03:24 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "So, I can damage with my eaos, support with my rental or repair with my bari."

03:24 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Support."

03:25 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Think jada has league, rental, and muti in 3s."

03:25 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Rental it is."

03:25 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Muty."

03:27 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "So bryan eaos, michael league, kert rental, jada muty if she can confirm?"

03:28 [Tactical Communication] Jada Nelson transmits, "Ok."

03:28 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Chetumal is the place."

03:28 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Who's repairs?"

03:28 [Tactical Communication] Ground Squad Leader Alko Delovega transmits, "Me."

03:47 Lily Kaise says, "Woo 99 conversion."

03:59 You stroke a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:59 a Tardick lizard named Asteria

03:59 This is one of the famed Tardick lizards. It has four legs: a thick, strong back pair and a foreshortened front pair. It seems to go on all fours most of the time, but it also stands up occasionally, using its front paws as somewhat awkward hands. Its toes have short but sharp talons. Its skin is dark gray and spotted with dark green, and parallel rows of silver-colored ridges run down its back to the tip of its long tail. Its yellow eyes betray little in the way of curiosity. A slim dark pink tongue flicks out every few seconds. It is wearing a slim leather collar with a tag reading ASTERIA.

04:53 You stand up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:53 You can't go that way.

04:53 You can't go that way.

04:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

04:53 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

04:53 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:55 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

04:55 Lily Kaise whispers, "Never. You are the only man I could ever want."

04:55 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins wiggles his hairy palps endearingly.

04:55 Lily Kaise strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

04:56 Lily says to a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, "Now out with you and stop spyiing."

04:56 Lily Kaise says, "Spying."

04:56 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:56 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:56 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:56 Lily says to you, "Nite Love."

04:58 You say to Lily, "Night love."

05:07 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing into the air briefly.

05:11 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

18:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What happened to the days where someone willing to lead a nest just called out what he or she wanted and that just happened? And maybe I should not have spoken up because I'm not going and it's really not my business but yeah..."

18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't really know what happened there."

18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not sure either. But why does someone think rental suits are just repair suits. They are support suits and can do both."

18:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I don't know."

18:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I never had a rental."

18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I love my rental. Fringe suits can dish out more damage, that is true... if they don't miss. And the accuracy on gravitics is really not the greatest."

18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

18:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "With chainguns some shots miss more and others do more damage, but that shots actually completely go astray is very rare I think."

18:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting."

18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I miss using the league suit."

18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I never really used it that much, but not having it is annoying when you need it."

18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was most surprised that we apparently rent all the suits."

18:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought my league suits would be mine to keep even after we lost the pact."

18:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But no."

18:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I already knew that because for that same reason we also have no access to mutuality suits."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "But the thing is, the League also gave up the AEU suits, and yeah rentals and mutuality suits can repair too and high tier mutuality suits do have minidrones, but still, every ground combat team needs a proper repair suit too."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

18:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They've been making do with the new bari suits."

18:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never used or seen one, but apparently they're good enough."

18:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I really wonder what effect this all has on ship components."

18:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We did lose some stuff I used a lot."

18:13 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

18:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like the laser plating."

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the luna tracking array."

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't do a lot of combat these days though, so I haven't really felt it."

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "What, we lost the luna tracking array? How on earth are we suppose to do tracking properly now then."

18:14 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Greetings AEU."

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Lily."

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "But do we also lose those from ships they are already on?"

18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Lily."

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well we gotta use the chetumal array."

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's significantly worse."

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No other tracking array can track 2 units away as far as I know?"

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But we don't lose them from ships they're on, no."

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's the only one."

18:15 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I didn't get the topic at hand what do we lose on where?"

18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We're talking about how we lost access to suits we owned."

18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well the League have one that is even better though, better far target tracking retention I think."

18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But noting that we don't lose access to ship components we own."

18:16 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh yeah it's the league suit I just sold both of mine. I probably could have just kept them but I wanted to free up the slots."

18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I scratch my head sometimes as some of the tech we have access to. Like the EAOS fiber optic and fringe massively parallel arrays."

18:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah I sold mine too, no sense in keeping that slot where now I can get other suits for that."

18:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why would you want the ability to track multiple targets? I've never seen anyone do it."

18:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like it would just confuse your gunners."

18:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It would confuse the, you know what... out of me."

18:17 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We don't have the same capabilities exactly but one can do quite a bit with the Thrall suit and the aEU can use light abilities like I did on our last cleanup of Old Frontier. I got into a little bit of trouble with being targeted at times but I managed."

18:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The thrall suit seems like it would be great for GMG and tesla."

18:18 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It is awesome for tesla. I use it all the time now."

18:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, then we went on to ship components and what the effects are, because I think the largest storage extender we have, is that League, the merchant? Do we still have that?"

18:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh crap, I forgot about the storage extender."

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That really sucks."

18:19 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "The issue is at Tier 3, there are no repair capabilities so it's more of an attacker at that level."

18:19 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No you can still get that."

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think the merchant-rade compression is league."

18:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, what Lily said."

18:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Merchant-grade."

18:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, but for the tier 2 and 3 level you do still have the rental which is pretty ok for solo tesla I think."

18:20 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't think that is league only it's still on Drydock and I have obtained it since our breakup."

18:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh yeah, I think that is old coalition tech or something?"

18:21 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah it is Merchant's which I don't believe belongs to league at all."

18:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think we should really come together to petition our government to either help us fix our relations with the League, or help us out with some of these components, like scoops and a better tracking array."

18:22 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So we lost the league battlesuit and the Luna tracker but one can get by with the Fringe Tracker. Just don't track two targets at a time unless you're comfortable with doing so."

18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The latter might be possible. I don't think the league is going to budge. I've even heard that they won't repair relations with us until the Mutuality signs off on it."

18:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "About the coalition tech, I have seen things in that same store that say something about coalition, does of course not mean all of that is old coalition, but it could be."

18:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I really can't get what we have done to deserve this treatement from them."

18:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Left the accord, said bad things about unregs."

18:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nevermind that leaving the accord doesn't mean we abandoned the defense of humanity."

18:24 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well Our government needs to assure Mutuality that they're not going to attack them. That was their concern when we met with them and since we could not provide enough assurance nor provide them with enough concrete/verifiable evidence that we could effect this with the AEU government, this is how we've lost access to the Skim. However, of course now they won't sell anything else to us."

18:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That the fringe used weapons on its own civilians and the league still wanted an alliance with them."

18:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That the fringe used weapons on its own civilians and the league still wanted an alliance with them."

18:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops, sorry."

18:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "League people surely have said bad things about unregs, not to mention the stinker particularly Morris made, on general, about the mutuality signing the non agression pact with Kelsy's lot."

18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, was he not in favor of that?"

18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And we never wanted to leave the accord. I never in my life said I wanted to leave the accord."

18:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we did what we could. I think the problem is the occupation has become too distant a memory for the people in power."

18:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh my goodness, he annoyed Aisling senselessly about it, where I just told her I didn't really like it, but I did understand her personal reasoning of wanting to protect her family."

18:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't mean we're finished, if we remain strong enough and willing enough to fight them together if they return."

18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Her family? Does she have family in the merry band?"

18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, oops."

18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No. But with a non agression pact I think she believes or hopes the pirates won't attack unregs, like her family?"

18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was confused."

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I thought we were talking about the similar pact the league just signed with Kelsey."

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That really chaps my hide -- the merry band invades and attacks our space more than the outsiders do."

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or maybe it even was the agreement or something, I don't know. That was what she told me anyway."

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they want to defend mutuality space, that's fine, but they also attack alliance space."

18:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can guarantee Ather will never support repairing relations with the League while they have such an agreement with Kelsey."

18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We also once had an inofficial spoken agreement where Kelsey said he was not going to attack us while so many of our pilots were out of comms on expeditions. A certain fringe pilot who ended in prison for felo abuse broke that and it ended in a cluster mess."

18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Anyway, I need to go do some stuff, later."

18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Later."

18:34 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Take care Kim."

18:35 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I think that still stands. The attacks have been from Clan Patrols lately."

18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think she might have meant him attacking home space while we're away."

18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't realize that was a huge problem, though."

18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like what happens when there's a sector siege when no one is awake?"

18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Doesn't the navy just get it?"

18:38 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "That was temporary though as it seems we may ourselves have broken that agreement but some of that is pretty vague now. I just can never support the approval of pirates in our space at any level. Yeah too, I know that Ather will more than likely never be willing to negotiate with the League since they are in bed with the Merry Band now."

18:40 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

18:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh well the League wanted Fringe Tech that's why. They sold out to the Mutuality in spite of the Merry Band so there you go."

18:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

18:41 Lily Kaise kisses you.

18:41 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.
