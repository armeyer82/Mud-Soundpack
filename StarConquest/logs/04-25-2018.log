00:04 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

00:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

00:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Think I'm gonna go read for a bit."

00:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stands up.

00:11 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

00:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes south.

00:14 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

00:16 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

00:16 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, and a sparkly ouija board here.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise is sleeping on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow.
FCI Scout Keegan Wantz and Ryan Thomas are standing in a stupor. FCI Scout Melinda Michaels is sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

00:16 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

00:17 You wave to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

00:17 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels waves.

00:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

00:19  You are wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:19 You are carrying a roll of sticky tape in your right hand, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria in your left hand.

00:19 You put on a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

00:20 You put a roll of sticky tape in a leather briefcase.

00:26 The damage control systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

00:27 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

00:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

00:35 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels grins at you. "I didn't do it."

00:35 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

00:36 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

00:37 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

00:40 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Foxtrot, Gamma, 02-14, Big Bird."

00:41 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hello."

00:42 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hello."

00:44 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "This space is still very local."

00:45 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Pedro Tumbly, veteran of the maple wars."

00:46 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "A terrible conflict of seasonal factions."

00:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:48 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:48 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yo."

00:48 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Mel."

00:49 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:49 You say over the linked rift comm, "Hello all."

00:49 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hi Shule."

00:49 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "This is starting to sound disturbingly like general."

00:50 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

00:50 You say over the linked rift comm, "I was just thinking that."

00:50 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Few expeditions have brought this many people. General is The People."

00:53 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

00:56 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels navigates her indigo slider einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

00:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:04 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "All the people."

01:05 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

01:09 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

01:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:14 FCI Scout Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

01:15 You beam at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

01:15 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

01:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise beams at you.

01:15 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:17 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels gives FCI Scout Lily Kaise a thumbs up!

01:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins at FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

01:18 FCI Scout Lily Kaise gives FCI Scout Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

01:19 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

01:19 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides south.

01:19 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

01:20 FCI Scout Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

01:30 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

01:31 You squeeze FCI Scout Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:37 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

01:37 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

01:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "AAh, not again."

01:37 You chuckle.

01:38 You say, "I don't think he likes this one."

01:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Nope."

01:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

01:38 You laugh.

01:39 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

01:43 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides in from the south.

01:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

01:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:53 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

01:53 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Greetings from the other ship."

01:53 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Greetings."

01:53 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yo."

01:54 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "It's a Meeeel."

02:02 The tingling of your nerves intensifies.

02:04 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.

02:04 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn waves. "Mmhmm...hi..."

02:04 I don't understand that.

02:04 You wave to FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn.

02:04 Hawthorn listlessly moves to look at the rift controls, his face sort of slack jawed. "I fucking hate this rift shit..."

02:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:05 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels waves to FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn.

02:05 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels removes a leather bound journal from a black canvas gear bag.

02:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Gonna sleep a bit more...think It's the night shift for me tonght...ugh..."

02:06 Hawthorn mumbles and trails off shuffling back into the ship's living blocks. "So...good....ugh..."

02:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

02:06 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels erases a page in a leather bound journal.

02:07 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels begins reading in a leather bound journal.

02:07 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels begins to write in a leather bound journal.

02:08 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels closes a leather bound journal.

02:08 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels puts a leather bound journal in a black canvas gear bag.

02:09 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Meh."

02:09 Kani Kahakai sashays in from the south.

02:09 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels smiles at Kani Kahakai.

02:10 Kani Kahakai waves.

02:10 You wave.

02:10 Melinda says to Kani, "Hey there."

02:10 Kani Kahakai exclaims, "Heya!"

02:11 Kani Kahakai asks, "How's the going?"

02:11 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "We should have something over 650 light-years to go."

02:11 Kani Kahakai sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

02:12 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

02:12 Melinda says to Kani, "Do you bring this rift scape with you or something?"

02:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

02:12 Kani Kahakai asks, "So three-ish more days?"

02:12 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

02:13 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Probably so."

02:13 Kani Kahakai says, "I am very pleasurable."

02:13 Kani Kahakai exclaims, "So maybe!"

02:13 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "It either started up when you or Shule came in here yesterday. I forget."

02:15 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:16 Kani Kahakai leans on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

02:16 Kani says to Melinda, "Whatcha gonna do about it?"

02:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:16 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels kisses Kani Kahakai on the lips.

02:16 Kani Kahakai smooches FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

02:17 Melinda says to Kani, "Is that good?"

02:18 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels squeezes Kani Kahakai affectionately.

02:18 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Kani Kahakai's neck.

02:18 Kani says to Melinda, "I dunno... you might need to try it again a few times before I figure it out."

02:18 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs. "I see."

02:22 Melinda says to Kani, "Last night was full of drive breaking storms. I hope this one will be more calm."

02:22 Kani Kahakai says, "Ouch."

02:22 Kani Kahakai says, "I missed all the drive breaking."

02:22 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

02:23 Your nerves tingle pleasantly with every pulse of the colors surrounding the ship.

02:23 Kani Kahakai says, "Don't have to grease up the hyperspanner just yet I guess...mmmmmnh."

02:23 "Problems?" FCI Scout Melinda Michaels grins at Kani Kahakai.

02:25 Kani Kahakai says, "No... no problems... just all... mmmmh, tiiiingly."

02:26 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ted is out of bed early. He's breaking the pattern. Breaking patterns is bad."

02:26 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels kisses Kani Kahakai on the lips.

02:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Maybe this riftscape roused him out of bed."

02:27 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, noctournal emissions will do that."

02:27 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ahem. I'm sure it rouses many things."

02:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:28 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Kani Kahakai's shoulder.

02:29 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Woo! Hi stormy storm storm!"

02:29 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Seems likely will be in path."

02:29 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Ah he has a sensor plant."

02:30 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

02:30 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yea."

02:31 The tingling of your nerves intensifies.

02:34 Kani squirms.

02:37 The voice of FCI Scout Aisling comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes."

02:37 You chuckle.

02:37 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Is it bad that I am highly amused by this?"

02:37 The voice of FCI Scout Erik Goodwin comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "People are very scouty today."

02:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

02:38 You say to Melinda, "Nope."

02:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "She'll make me sleep in the floor."

02:39 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels hugs Kani Kahakai.

02:39 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

02:39 You chuckle at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

02:39 Melinda says to Lily, "Oh remind me to catch you up sometime on lizards and Lillian."

02:39 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

02:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh sighs ok."

02:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Did anyone find hers?"

02:40 Kani says to Melinda, "Why would I make you sleep on the floor?"

02:40 Melinda says to Kani, "For teasing you over that riftscape."

02:40 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels grins.

02:40 Kani Kahakai says, "That Lizillian story makes me so mad."

02:40 Kani Kahakai pouts.

02:41 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Kani Kahakai's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:41 Melinda says to Lily, "Basically, she was supposed to come back tomorrow to discuss stuff. That was last March. So, I waited till November for tomorrow to come then wrote her a good-bye letter."

02:42 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "Maybe even February."

02:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I sure don't blame you."

02:43 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "YOu got her a Lizard and there's no sign of it right?"

02:43 Melinda says to Lily, "Well earlier this month, I finally found Isis and she was hungry. So I fed her and we were taking care of her. Lillian shows up a couple weeks later and takes the lizard out of my apartment because stupid me forgot to remove her access. Thing is, she didn't collect her other belongings and we haven't seen her since she took the lizard."

02:43 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh sighs."

02:43 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "That poor lizard."

02:43 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods.

02:44 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I'm glad it was still alive but it's sure being neglected."

02:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "So I am figuring out what I can possibly do about it. It's like she showed up to just nab the lizard and go again."

02:44 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah which is purely selfish at the cost of the poor lizard's well-being."

02:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I sure hope you can get custody of it at least."

02:45 You nod.

02:45 You say, "Wow."

02:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I thought for sure it had died of starvation."

02:46 You say, "I'm glad it hadn't yet."

02:46 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I don't want to fight with her but, she's not good with pets and never was with her wild felo either. I took care of those most of the time."

02:46 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "So I am probably gonna hafta make an issue of it."

02:46 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Me too but who is caring for it. I did see Lillian on the comms a few days ago but haven't since."

02:47 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Like over a week ago?"

02:47 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah."

02:47 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "That's when she took the lizard."

02:47 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

02:48 Kani Kahakai says, "She was around for literally just at day."

02:48 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I told her I wanted to talk to her about the lizard and she never answered me. I told her I had a bunch of her things and she never bothered to get those."

02:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:49 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that is just so strange. If I had to not be able to take care of Asteria, I'd make Shule or someone took care of her."

02:50 You grin.

02:50 You say, "Yeah."

02:50 You say, "She usually gives Asteria to me."

02:50 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "She's probably being an ass because I left her."

02:51 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "But when you make promises to do things then leave for a year, what do you expect."

02:51 Kani Kahakai says, "Cute name, Asteria."

02:51 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods. "It is."

02:51 You nod to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

02:51 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I'd never expect anyone to wait for me a year."

02:52 You say, "Neither would I."

02:52 Kani says to Melinda, "I'm glad you decided to move on."

02:52 Kani Kahakai says, "Because... reasons."

02:52 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

02:52 You grin.

02:53 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels hugs Kani Kahakai.

03:04 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

03:09 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

03:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides east.

03:12 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides in from the east.

03:22 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Ooer."

03:22 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Hurrah astable."

03:23 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Yup, we should hit this one."

03:25 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

03:25 You wave to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

03:26 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:26 You laugh.

03:27 Ryan Thomas says, "Haha."

03:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:27 Ryan Thomas yawns violently.

03:27 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm not sure why we're laughing. I thought I heard Shule laugh just now though."

03:27 Ryan Thomas says, "So I thought I'd join in."

03:27 Ryan Thomas opens a copy of "A Journey to Friendship".

03:27 Ryan Thomas begins reading in a copy of "A Journey to Friendship".

03:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "The lizard."

03:27 Ryan Thomas closes a copy of "A Journey to Friendship".

03:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "The thing is... I don't even think we can trade for Lizards anymore. I believe that Anfisa's may have been the last one and that was what over two years ago?"

03:29 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe."

03:29 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I mean, maybe we've just been missing them."

03:29 Ryan Thomas shrugs.

03:29 You say to Lily, "It sure has been a while since anyone has gotten a lizard."

03:29 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

03:29 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods.

03:30 Ryan Thomas says, "I don't want one. But then I didn't want a felo until Blake gave us Tiger and now I can't help but to like the damn thing."

03:30 You chuckle.

03:30 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "We've been back a number of times though and a fair amoutn of trading has been conducted. I sure tried to trade for one for Sule but nothing near."

03:30 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:30 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

03:30 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Shulr that is."

03:31 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I will share Zeus."

03:31 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow sorry Shule I am having issues with pronouncing your name! What did you put in my coffee!"
FCI Scout Melinda Michaels kisses Kani Kahakai on her chin.

03:33 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "I'm good!"

03:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh one of those crazy storms."

03:33 You say, "I'm doing well."

03:33 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor smiles at you.

03:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "The kind that likes to be sneaky."

03:34 You smile at FCI Scout Clarina Taylor.

03:34 Clarina says to Keegan, "That so?"

03:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs at FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

03:34 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Indeed, I have kidnapped Skipper."

03:34 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "He is in my trousers."

03:34 Ryan Thomas says, "Who did you take skipper from."

03:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Ha ha."

03:34 Ryan Thomas says, "Oh....k."

03:34 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Skipper is Ather and I's child."

03:34 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "He is the best lizard."

03:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glances at you.

03:34 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "Who... wha.."

03:34 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor asks, "In your trousers?"

03:34 Lily says to you, "Sorry to tell you the truth!"

03:34 Ryan Thomas says, "I just am gonna leave that one alone."

03:34 Keegan says to Ryan, "I was not intentionally making a penis joke."

03:34 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

03:35 Ryan Thomas laughs.

03:35 Lily says to you, "But you are in luck! I had asteria prior to when we started dating."

03:35 Melinda says to Clarina, "Hey there."

03:35 You say to Lily, "What?"

03:35 Kani Kahakai says, "It is unfortunate that people treat them more like trophies and status symbols than as animals."

03:35 FCI Scout Lily Kaise chuckles.

03:35 Clarina says to Melinda, "Hullo."

03:35 Ryan Thomas nods to Kani Kahakai.

03:35 Lily says to you, "Well Keegan says that skipper is his and ather's child!"

03:36 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:36 You chuckle.

03:36 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "Some people also treat there children as status symbols, unfortunately."

03:36 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

03:36 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

03:36 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "True."

03:36 Ryan Thomas says, "I've always wanted a dog."

03:36 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "And me acting like a bitch doesn not count."

03:36 Ryan Thomas laughs.

03:36 Ryan Thomas says, "Nah."

03:37 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "A dog would bee very nice."

03:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I'm a cat person. I took in every stray I could find and filled up our barn with kitties and then we let a few nice ones come into our house so."

03:37 You grin at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:37 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "I like cats too."

03:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins at you.

03:37 Ryan Thomas says, "Cats are all right. I've liked a couple."

03:37 Ryan Thomas says, "My sister's cat fatty was a bitch, though."

03:37 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I was a dog person when still at home."

03:37 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "Dogs like to cuddle more though."

03:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Haha."

03:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well the nice cats we kept were big cuddlers."

03:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "All of the ones who hungout in the barn were pretty nice too but more aloof."

03:38 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor nods.

03:39 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "I can see that."

03:39 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "To be fair."

03:39 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I'm not convinced that the lizards are actually alive."

03:39 Ryan Thomas asks, "No?"

03:39 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor asks, "Really?"

03:39 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Kinda like the spiders."

03:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

03:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well they do like to eat!"

03:39 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Still though, someone who neglects stuff for a year doesn't deserve it."

03:39 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Indeed, they are faux biological. They are mechanical contructs with a fake skin and enough of a fake mouth that we don't look closer."

03:39 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz glances wildly about in a paranoid manner.

03:40 FCI Scout Lily Kaise blinks at FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

03:40 Clarina says to Melinda, "Certainly not."

03:40 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz asks, "Has your lizard ever shat on you?"

03:40 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

03:40 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah akemi said essentially the same thing."

03:40 Ryan Thomas says, "I've wondered that."

03:40 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

03:40 Clarina says to Melinda, "If I'd ever, ever, neglected any of our horses, I would have been disowned."

03:40 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz asks, "Have you ever seen your lizard defecate at all?"

03:40 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "No thankfully."

03:40 Ryan says to Keegan, "That's actually a really good thought."

03:40 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz chuckles.

03:40 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Nope but I still stand by my statement."

03:40 Ryan Thomas says, "But come to think of it I've never seen felo shit either."

03:41 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I'm not sure felo even have excretory organs."

03:41 Ryan Thomas says, "Maybe they do it in their nest or whatever."

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I generally let her roam more when I'm back in home space and yeah same with felo."

03:41 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Other than their slime."

03:41 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

03:41 Ryan Thomas says, "Or don't poop."
Ryan Thomas nods.

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Well how about pets?"

03:41 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "They're cute regardless."

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "They don't have a nest to poop in!"

03:41 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor nods.

03:41 You say, "True."

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:41 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Spiders excrete web and eat it again."

03:41 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:42 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "I need to change."

03:42 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "Be right back."

03:42 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:42 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor glides south.

03:42 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "They do, it's gross."

03:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Spiders well... I guess when they do the web thing is when they're essentially pooping but they're disgusting because they eat it."

03:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:42 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "But they aren't alive."

03:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "True."

03:43 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I never left mine unattended but I suppose if I didn't feed it for awhile, he'd just go dormant."

03:43 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "I'm pretty sure Spiders are more alive than lizards, if we're starting to do relative levels of living."

03:43 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Right which is what the lizards do but that doesn't give someone the right to just throw it down."
FCI Scout Keegan Wantz chuckles.

03:44 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

03:44 Nissi Valdaire puts an atlas-sized light brown leather-bound book with the title embossed in black and the pages edged in silver gilt in a black leather shoulder bag stitched with silver stars and decorated with steel studs.

03:44 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

03:44 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Lizards are almost like cat-bots, except you give them food every now and oh dear."

03:44 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."

03:44 Ryan Thomas asks, "How's it going?"

03:44 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor glides in from the south.

03:44 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "That is a big book."

03:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Na, you can see their ribs after awhile."

03:44 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "Comfortable."

03:44 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

03:44 Lily says to Melinda, "Yeah especially when you did the work to trade for it and you probably spent the funds on the trade goods."

03:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "They don't die but look bad."

03:44 Keegan says to Melinda, "Didn't know that!"

03:44 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz exclaims, "They may be alive after all!"

03:44 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz beams.

03:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz. "You can."

03:44 Keegan says to Nissi, "We were entertaining the idea that lizards are robots."

03:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Really so they still survive even without feeding?"

03:45 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor says, "I forgot my fluffy socks. I am presently.. Hmm. Disgruntled."

03:45 Ryan Thomas grins at FCI Scout Clarina Taylor.

03:45 Melinda says to Lily, "I think they go dormant somehow to keep from starving."

03:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "They can last a long time if you fill them up."

03:46 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "But take one from my apartment after you've been gone a year, bad move."

03:46 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "So when you found Lillian's how did you get it to come to enough to eat."

03:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "They might be."

03:46 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor asks, "Wait someone did that?"

03:46 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:46 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods to FCI Scout Clarina Taylor.

03:46 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor exclaims, "Fuckery!"

03:46 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Well the note I got only says 40 cycles which is what a week?"

03:47 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

03:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:47 Melinda says to Lily, "It woke up and started eating when I put it on my shoulder and fed it."

03:47 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

03:47 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I would probably cry."

03:47 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I wasn't happy."

03:47 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:47 You nod.

03:48 You say, "I bet."

03:48 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I don't really cry often but when it concerns animals..."

03:48 You squeeze FCI Scout Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:48 FCI Scout Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:49 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "I put Higgins and my two pets in a Cruiser so he's got enough chow to last a few months!"

03:49 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:49 You grin at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:50 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Same goes for the pets because just the two of them won't eat that much."

03:50 Lily says to Melinda, "So no they're not in the cryos!"

03:50 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:50 You chuckle at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:51 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I brought an orange Soldier and a White soldier."

03:52 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

03:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "So if anybody is curious, as of midnight we'd gone 310 lightyears in a day. Which is really good. But... only 180 lightyears the day before."

03:53 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor nods.

03:53 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:56 "Yeah that first day was rather tedious!" FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

05:42 Lily says to you, "I wish we had at least 100 hours per day! Alas, I should say nite. I hope you'll rest well and sweet dreams."

05:42 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

05:53 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

06:40 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

06:43 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

06:43 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

06:43 The stage lights flicker briefly.

06:48 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

07:44 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

07:44 Listen. You need to be careful.

07:44 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

07:46 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

08:39 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

08:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Done."

08:47 Remember what I said.

08:47 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

09:17 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

09:26 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

09:31 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

09:31 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

09:31 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

09:32 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

09:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks Ian!"

09:34 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

10:01 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

10:11 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

10:21 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

10:31 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

10:32 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

10:32 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

11:02 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

11:13 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

11:23 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

11:33 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

11:33 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

12:21 Rippling colours dance and wave along this long rainbow road, their motion dizzying and endless. The scintillating pathway curves and dips smoothly through the air, stretching off into distant clouds. The clouds drift around placidly, their laziness a stark contrast to the fervent activity of the pathway. Sparkling jewel-studded blackness is revealed behind the fluffy clouds wherever they part. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

12:34 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

12:34 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

13:11 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

13:11 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

13:11 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

13:11 The voice of FCI Scout Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yep."

13:11 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

13:12 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the south.

13:12 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

13:12 Gonzales Bourne switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

13:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

13:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

13:31 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

13:31 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, and a sparkly ouija board here.
Ali Candan is sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa. Gonzales Bourne is standing here. FCI Scout Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

13:31 I see no "lily" here.

13:32 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morning."

13:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Yo."

13:32 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.

13:32 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves.

13:32 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn waves. "Hey."

13:33 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn navigates his slate blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

13:37 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Gonna go rest for a lil bit."

13:37 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stands up.

13:37 You wave to FCI Scout Morris Corlew.

13:38 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes south.

13:41 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

13:51 You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship several spaces.

13:52 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "How's life over there?"

13:52 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

13:52 The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Sleepy, but that's better than exciting with the threat of ship explosions."

14:02 You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship several spaces.

14:12 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

14:42 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

14:52 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

15:02 You hear someone pounding impatiently upon the hull.

15:04 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south followed by Wendy Arroyo.

15:04 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "Morning!"

15:04 Nissi Valdaire says, "Heeey."

15:04 Nissi Valdaire's group walks east.

15:04 I don't see that here.

15:05 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the east followed by Wendy Arroyo.

15:05 You wave to Nissi Valdaire.

15:05 Nissi Valdaire waves!

15:05 You wave to Wendy Arroyo.

15:05 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

15:05 Nissi Valdaire takes a bite of a hot scrambled egg and ham sandwich with cheese.

15:05 Ali Candan exclaims, "Hello!"

15:05 Ali Candan says, "Now that we have more people awake, I'll be back in 2 hours."

15:05 Wendy Arroyo says, "Hello, it's me, Nissi Valdaire."

15:05 Ali Candan stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

15:05 Ali Candan gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

15:05 Ali Candan strides south.

15:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Did we stop at some point? The trade cycles seem...off or maybe I read it wrong the first time."

15:05 I don't see that here.

15:06 Wendy Arroyo says, "We stopped for repairs."

15:06 Wendy Arroyo lies down on a nylon relaxation hammock.

15:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh... I must've fell asleep."

15:06 Wendy Arroyo takes a bite of a hot personal cheese pizza.

15:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "So much pizza."

15:07 Wendy Arroyo says, "Nothing wrong with pizza."

15:07 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "True. Though can you eat pizza every day for a month and not get tired of it?"

15:08 Wendy Arroyo nods.

15:08 Wendy Arroyo says, "Yes, no doubt."

15:09 Nissi Valdaire says, "Pizza contains all the major food groups."

15:09 You say, "This is true."

15:09 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "If worst comes to worse, pizza will let you survive."

15:09 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn grins.

15:11 Nissi Valdaire takes a bite of a hot scrambled egg and ham sandwich with cheese.

15:13 You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.

15:13 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

15:13 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

15:14 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just in time for breakfast."

15:14 You chuckle.

15:14 Nissi Valdaire takes a bite of a hot scrambled egg and ham sandwich with cheese.

15:14 Wendy Arroyo takes a bite of a hot personal cheese pizza.

15:14 Wendy Arroyo says, "I love breakfast pizza."

15:15 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I do too."

15:15 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Especially with lots of hashbrowns."

15:17 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hashbrown pizza."

15:17 You grin.

15:17 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Hashborwn casserole sounds amazing right now too."

15:20 Ryan Thomas roams in from the south.

15:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn waves to Ryan Thomas.

15:20 Nissi Valdaire takes a bite of a hot scrambled egg and ham sandwich with cheese.

15:20 You wave to Ryan Thomas.

15:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn exclaims, "Hi!"

15:20 Ryan Thomas asks, "How's it going?"

15:20 Ryan Thomas says, "Did we stop for a time last night or did I miss repairs or somesuch."

15:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Plodding along."

15:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Repairs."

15:23 Wendy Arroyo says, "We stopped to order pizza."

15:24 You chuckle.

15:24 Nissi Valdaire grins.

15:24 You say, "While we were repairing."

15:24 Nissi Valdaire finishes off a hot scrambled egg and ham sandwich with cheese.

15:24 Ryan Thomas asks, "More pizza?"

15:24 You say to Ryan, "Lots more pizza."

15:24 You say, "And more pizza."

15:24 Wendy Arroyo says, "Backroads had the right call, buying out a rift galleon."

15:25 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I think Mel posted we're at 500 some to go so just under half way there."

15:25 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "10000 for the pizza, 1 billion for the delivory!"

15:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

15:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves and smiles.

15:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

15:27 You smile at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

15:27 You wrap your arms around FCI Scout Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

15:27 Nissi Valdaire waves.

15:28 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

15:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

15:28 You beam at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

15:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise beams at you.

15:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:29 Wendy Arroyo takes a bite of a hot personal cheese pizza.

15:31 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn waves to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

15:31 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves to FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn.

15:31 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Hm."

15:31 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

15:32 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Huh. We're at 39 percent charge."

15:32 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "We're doing great!"

15:32 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.

15:32 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "This thing has a huge battery life."

15:32 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

15:32 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

15:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "Little bit."

15:32 Wendy Arroyo says, "Almost as much as my cargo hauler."

15:32 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

15:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise glances down at her neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

15:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

15:36 Hawthorn says to Nissi, "On trips like this when do you usually charge. I always get freaked out when I see the charge getting lower and lower. And the debris in the storage and all that."

15:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "Usually when there's a day remaining."

15:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "That's uh... how many cycles... six of them, right?"

15:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "It's easy to get freaked out about 39%. Then you look at the time and realize that's two days."

15:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn nods.

15:38 Nissi Valdaire says, "Basically I'm not one of those people who's used half the furnace before 1000 lightyears."

15:38 Nissi Valdaire grins.

15:38 Ryan Thomas says, "Hopefully we find some sort of debris field to restock on dbris."

15:38 Ryan Thomas coughs.

15:38 Ryan Thomas says, "Debris."

15:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins at Nissi Valdaire.

15:38 You grin.

15:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well there is some in the storeroom."

15:39 Wendy Arroyo says, "Oh, we don't use debris here."

15:39 Nissi Valdaire says, "A prestellar or nebula is ideal, but an asteroid field will do."

15:39 Wendy Arroyo says, "If you'll go to the storage, you'll see we have cryogenically frozen felo."

15:39 Ryan Thomas nods.

15:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

15:39 Ryan Thomas says, "They'll work."

15:39 Nissi Valdaire grins.

15:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

15:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves.

15:42 You wave to FCI Scout Morris Corlew.

15:42 Nissi Valdaire waves.

15:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Howdy scouty type piloty folks."

15:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

15:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves to FCI Scout Morris Corlew.

15:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves to FCI Scout Lily Kaise and waves to you.

15:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves to Nissi Valdaire.

15:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes east.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the east.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stands up.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes south.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

15:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

15:43 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

15:44 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

15:44 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Y'all stop torturin Johann. That just ain't nice, now."

15:44 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ah, breakfast and torturous screams, what a wonderful way to spend the day."

15:44 The voice of FCI Scout Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh, the pain!"

15:44 You chuckle at FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn.

15:44 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn. "Yep."

15:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

15:45 The voice of FCI Scout Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Man up, Johann. It'll be over soon."

15:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot round piece of cinnamon toast.

15:45 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

15:45 You say over the linked rift comm, "Or maybe that's just the beginning?"

15:45 FCI Scout Morris Corlew chuckles.

15:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

15:49 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Mornin Asteria."

15:49 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

15:50 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I want an exotic bug instead of a lizard, like a cool butterfly thing or something that glows. Like a pet firefly, but...big. and hopefully not ugly."

15:50 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

15:50 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "One day I will discover this thing."

15:54 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

15:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot round piece of cinnamon toast.

15:54 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Okay I gotta get breakfast food now."

15:54 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

15:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

15:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I'm a bad influence."

15:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

15:54 Hawthorn snorts out a laugh.

15:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I also have no regreats."

15:54 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles east.

15:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Erm."

15:54 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Regrets either."

15:55 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the east.

15:55 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

15:55 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn waves to Gonzales Bourne.

15:55 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn takes a bite of a hot roll of scrambled eggs with minced vegetables inside it.

15:55 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot round piece of cinnamon toast.

15:56 Wendy Arroyo finishes off a hot personal cheese pizza.

15:58 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mm."

15:58 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn takes a bite of a hot roll of scrambled eggs with minced vegetables inside it.

15:58 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a sip of a glass of chilled orange juice.

15:58 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "There's peas in this and I'm not sure I like it."

15:58 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Not a fan of peas?"

15:58 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn takes a bite of a hot roll of scrambled eggs with minced vegetables inside it.

15:58 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "They're nasty as hell."

15:59 FCI Scout Morris Corlew chuckles.

15:59 FCI Scout Morris Corlew takes a bite of a hot round piece of cinnamon toast.

15:59 Nissi Valdaire says, "Peas are okay. Sometimes."

15:59 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I ain't a fan of 'em -in- my mac and cheese...but otherwise they're alright."

16:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:00 FCI Scout Morris Corlew finishes off a hot round piece of cinnamon toast.

16:00 FCI Scout Morris Corlew finishes off a glass of chilled orange juice.

16:00 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gives a glass to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

16:00 FCI Scout Morris Corlew pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly. "Thank ya."

16:00 Wendy Arroyo nods to Nissi Valdaire. "I agree, olives are great."

16:00 Nissi Valdaire says, "Olives are not food."

16:01 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Better'n Brussels sprouts."

16:01 FCI Scout Morris Corlew wrinkles his nose, looking faintly disgusted.

16:04 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

16:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Woo, 6%."

16:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Brusselsprouts are good if they're fried in bacon grease and with bacon on them."

16:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Ick...no."

16:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Have you had them that way?"

16:06 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Gimme cabbage any day. Brussels sprouds sound't even be a food."

16:06 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yes."

16:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "But...brustles sprouts are like small cabbages."

16:06 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Bacon is a way to save a lotta foods, but there is no savin Brussels sprouds."

16:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "They taste almost the same."

16:06 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "They taste like vile lil cabbages that don't know they're sposed to taste like cabbages."

16:07 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I protest against that assessment. You just gotta know how to cook them."

16:07 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn grins.

16:07 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Oh...my family can cook...but no matter how you dress up Brussels sprouts, they're still the nastiest thing since Outsider puffs."

16:08 Wendy Arroyo pokes Nissi Valdaire in the ribs!

16:08 Nissi Valdaire nudges Wendy Arroyo gently.

16:08 Hawthorn says to Morris, "We no longer can be friends. I mean if it was asperagus, or peas, we could agree, but this is unacceptable."

16:08 Wendy Arroyo nudges Nissi Valdaire gently.

16:09 Morris says to Hawthorn, "You don't like sparegrass?"

16:09 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Hell no."

16:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Tsk tsk."

16:09 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Don't you tut at me."

16:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "That's one you definitely gotta have it made right to enjoy it. So I get it."

16:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins at FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn.

16:09 Hawthorn waggles a finger at Morris.

16:09 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves his finger around vaguely.

16:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Wrapped in bacon and grilled to perfection."

16:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew licks his lips.

16:10 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Okay... I can do it that way,but I mean bacon is the food saver."

16:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Mostly."

16:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Please tell me least you don't like beets."

16:10 Morris seems to be holding back a gag.

16:10 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ugh no."

16:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "There, finally. Some common ground."

16:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew chuckles.

16:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "What, how can you not like beets."

16:11 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I can't eat them in borscht or greek salads."

16:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "They're sweet."

16:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew stares at Nissi Valdaire.

16:11 You grin at Nissi Valdaire.

16:11 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn blinks at Nissi Valdaire.

16:11 Hawthorn says to Nissi, "You are a monster."

16:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "They're nasty. They musta come from the Outsider homeworld centuries ago..."

16:11 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I mean it's like parsnips though they're like bland carrots."

16:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

16:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Don't know I ever had parsnips."

16:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Turnips."

16:12 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "But not parsnips."

16:12 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Parsnips literally are the carrots less impressive cousin and they usually get mashed and it's just...ugh."

16:13 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Why would you mash...ok...potatoes are ok for mashin...maybe turnips...but carrotcousins?"

16:13 You say, "There's nothing wrong with mashing vegetables."

16:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I'd rather eat most my veggies whole or cut. Taters are designed to be mashed. But...otherwise...baby food."

16:14 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before they fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

16:15 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

16:15 You say, "Well, vegetables are pretty much mashed in sauces many times."

16:15 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

16:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "What veggie is cream sauce made of?"

16:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

16:16 You say, "For example, a good way to thicken spaghetti sauce is to pretty much mash vegetables into it."

16:16 Wendy Arroyo says, "With your bare hands."

16:16 You chuckle.

16:16 Nissi Valdaire grins.

16:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "My ma did that tryin to get Effie to eat veggies. Made me not wanna eat the pasketti."

16:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew frowns.

16:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Spaghetti."

16:18 Nissi Valdaire says, "Spurgrotti."

16:18 You grin.

16:18 Morris says to Nissi, "That makes it sound gross."

16:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I stayed over at a friend's house...their ma tried to pass sketti squash over as sketti noodles. Was so hard not to be rude..."

16:19 You say, "Oh yeah, I had that before. Not the best really in my opinion."

16:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "It's..."

16:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew frowns.

16:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "No. It's like passin off mashed turnips as mashed taters."

16:19 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Speghetti squash one time and it wasn't bad, but definitely not having it again. Zukini though, omnomnom."

16:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Zuccini bread is the bomb."

16:20 You say, "That is pretty good."

16:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I like frying it with garlic and onions and then having it over buttered noodles."

16:20 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

16:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

16:20 You say, "Although my favorite is jalapeno cheese bread."

16:20 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

16:20 A readout shows Opik-Oort Signature 8898-5940 about 14.76 light-grand cycles toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Slightly Up.
FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods to you. "Yum."

16:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Aww."

16:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "I could go for some good corn bread though."

16:21 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Just a plain orte cloud."

16:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Not that sweet stuff some folks try and pass off as corn bread that's more like corn cake, though."

16:21 You say, "True."

16:22 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Johnny cake? It's the only way to make cornbread. The other shit isn't worth it."

16:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

16:22 Wendy Arroyo says, "I like Nissicake."

16:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:23 You chuckle at Wendy Arroyo.

16:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Ain't Johnny cakes the ones that're kinda like pancakes?"

16:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew asks, "Like a flatbread thing?"

16:23 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I dunno. I thought that's what sweet cornbread was called."

16:23 I don't understand that.

16:23 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "What my mother always called it."

16:24 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "She makes it with beansoup."

16:24 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Probably. We call 'em hoe cakes...and I never cared for 'em. I like the real corn bread...without all the sweetness."

16:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "I eat Nissicake. I'm not sure what that says about me."

16:28 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

16:28 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Says you like chocolate."

16:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:34 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

16:39 Wendy Arroyo yawns.

16:40 Nissi Valdaire leans toward Wendy Arroyo and softly licks her cheek.

16:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:41 FCI Scout Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

16:42 FCI Scout Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

16:43 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Bit over 500 light-years to go."

16:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

16:45 The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul screaming within.

16:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "There are three doors."

16:49 Wendy Arroyo pets Nissi Valdaire on the head.

16:49 Nissi Valdaire grins.

16:49 Wendy Arroyo says, "Sure there are."

16:52 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

16:52 Ali Candan sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

16:52 Ali Candan waves.

16:53 Ali Candan says, "Still Local Space I see."

16:53 Wendy Arroyo says, "It's one of the famed rift entities."

16:53 Nissi Valdaire waves.

16:56 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

16:58 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:59 Morris says to Nissi, "I used that three doors example as to why it was more likely we'd get a rapid on a third high gunship beacon when we'd already had two without one. Can't think who it was asked me if that meant the chances went up as you launched more beacons."

16:59 Nissi Valdaire grins.

17:00 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "But that's not the same thing at all!"

17:00 Wendy Arroyo says, "There are three rapids..."

17:00 Morris says to Nissi, "Not quite. But if you have say...a three outta four chance of gettin a rapid on a beacon, and you've had two beacons with no rapids...then the chance you'll actually get one on the third is higher overall than if you hadn't done any at all."

17:01 Nissi Valdaire says, "No it isn't."

17:01 Ali Candan exclaims, "No it is not!"

17:01 Ryan Thomas says, "Gambler's falacy."

17:01 Ali Candan says, "It is still 3 out of 4."

17:01 Wendy Arroyo exclaims, "And just for charm, it isn't!"

17:01 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "It's still three out of four, but since you've already done 2 without..."

17:01 Wendy Arroyo says, "Since you've done two without, it still hasn't changed at all."

17:01 Nissi Valdaire asks, "If you flip a coin ten times and it's heads ten times, what's it gonna be on the next toss?"

17:01 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "The person asked was it higher...I said no, but we've already done two without."

17:01 Ali Candan says, "You might as well get another one without a rapid. It's all just chance, and it's just 3 out of 4."

17:02 Ali says to Nissi, "You're cheating if you get 10 heads in a row."

17:02 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

17:03 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "It's possible though!"

17:03 Ali Candan grins.

17:03 Ali Candan says, "For sure."

17:03 Wendy Arroyo says, "Nissi's coins have three heads."

17:03 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Sure it is. But the more coins you flip the closer it's gonna be to 50% heads and 50% tails."

17:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "And the odds would still be 50% for the next toss."

17:03 Ali Candan nods to Nissi Valdaire.

17:03 Ali Candan says, "The odds does not change."

17:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well. I'm glad even jokingly bringing up the three doors still led to strange disagreements about probability."

17:04 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

17:04 FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins at Nissi Valdaire.

17:04 FCI Scout Lily Kaise absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

17:04 Ali Candan says, "I was not even here."

17:04 Ali Candan grins.

17:04 Wendy Arroyo says, "There are three coins..."

17:04 FCI Scout Morris Corlew opens a royal blue silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered silver stars.

17:04 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "That pertains to the one instance not every instance."

17:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew removes three zhu from a royal blue silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered silver stars.

17:05 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "Or hum one instance at a time. I probably still stated that incorrectly!"

17:05 Morris says to Wendy, "Three coins."

17:05 Morris tosses one of three zhu from one hand to the other.

17:05 Wendy Arroyo says, "Yes, three coins."

17:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew puts three zhu in a royal blue silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered silver stars.

17:05 FCI Scout Morris Corlew closes a royal blue silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered silver stars.

17:06 The ship passes over an odiferous swamp with piles of bodies lying beneath the water. Other people fight viciously on the surface, while the ones below gurgle impotently.

17:06 FCI Scout Morris Corlew wrinkles his nose.

17:06 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "More odiferous'n Agnarr's bowels."

17:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:13 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Holy...what is wrong with the rift..."

17:13 FCI Scout Morris Corlew looks at FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn thoughtfully.

17:13 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Everythin. Always."

17:13 Hawthorn staresas the corpses float on by, his face going a little green.

17:13 Morris says to Hawthorn, "Ever read Dante's Inferno?"

17:14 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "...No. I wasn't much of a student."

17:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew nods.

17:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "This is...well..."

17:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

17:14 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Even that Lasciate...whatever. Abandon all hope, you who enter here."

17:14 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "So fucked up."

17:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "It's...hell."

17:15 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

17:16 Many people march by on the shore, whipped and tormented by demons.

17:17 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

17:17 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

17:20 Wendy Arroyo says, "That couldn't be hell."

17:20 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Where were the artifacts?"

17:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins at Wendy Arroyo.

17:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, spiders now. Wonderful."

17:21 Nissi Valdaire grins.

17:26 Ali Candan says, "We'll be out of NDB range today."

17:26 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

17:27 Wendy Arroyo says, "Finally out of comms."

17:29 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

17:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:45 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!', a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a large crystal ball, and a sparkly ouija board here.

FCI Scout Morris Corlew is sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug. Nissi Valdaire, FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn, and Ali Candan are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

17:47 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor glides in from the south.

17:47 A row of perfectly ordered oval cocoons move past a window.

17:47 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor gives an empty beverage can to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

17:47 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor yawns.

17:49 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor glides south.

17:51 Wendy Arroyo says, "Good talk."

17:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "6.28 LTC. That's almost 6.29 LTC."

17:53 FCI Scout Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

17:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "Did you know we have skeeball."

17:53 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I am terrible at it."

17:54 Wendy says to Nissi, "I did not."

17:54 Ali Candan says, "Good game."

17:54 Ali Candan says, "I haven't managed to hit 100 yet."

17:54 Wendy says to Nissi, "I hadn't been on this ship before this trip."

17:56 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "It's a nice ship."

17:57 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

17:57 Ali Candan says, "I want to have our speed fixed to 4416. Make it happen."

17:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

18:00 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor glides in from the south.

18:00 You wave to FCI Scout Clarina Taylor.

18:00 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor waves to you.

18:00 FCI Scout Clarina Taylor sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

18:01 Hawthorn says to Clarina, "Hi!"

18:06 Wendy Arroyo snores.

18:08 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

18:10 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

18:10 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Flow's got some fast speed. If it were comin behind us...zooooom."

18:11 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

18:11 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

18:11 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

18:11 Nissi Valdaire walks in from the south.

18:11 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

18:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "THERE."

18:11 Nissi Valdaire exclaims, "I hate speed!"

18:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew grins.

18:11 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Ouch."

18:17 Wendy Arroyo says, "Nobody likes speed."

18:17 FCI Scout Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

18:18 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So, ah... I don't mean to ALARM anybody, but Ian tells me our closest approach to the last known borders of Outsider space is likely to be sometime today."

18:18 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

18:18 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

18:18 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "That doesn't surprise me."

18:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Thanks Jim."

18:19 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So, you know, keep on doing what you're doing. Watch movies, play checkers, whatever you guys do."

18:19 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But, ah, if an Outsider patrol shows up, try to act surprised."

18:19 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks for the info."

18:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Horrible People and shoot the breeze...and wait for Outsiders."

18:19 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Thanks for the Reality Check!"

18:19 Wendy Arroyo says into the PA microphone, "Competitive sensor pinging."

18:19 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "How's it goin, TEAM leader?"

18:20 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Like I just have an image of Jim with a beer in one hand and a magazine in the others while saying come fight me outsider bitches for some reason."

18:20 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, you know, great. Just great."

18:20 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "Well...that's better'n awful..."

18:21 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sweet."

18:21 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Uh huh."

18:22 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "So...outsider patrols. let's hope it's a small one."

18:22 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Well...we've prepared for it best we can."

18:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Lily Kaise's neck.

18:22 Morris says to Nissi, "Did you want to post them evasion instructions to the board? I still got 'em handy."

18:23 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

18:23 Wendy Arroyo says, "Stay on course and slow down. Psych them out by making them believe you're not afraid."

18:23 Nissi Valdaire grins.

18:23 Nissi Valdaire navigates her metallic purple swivel einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Well...don't stay on course."

18:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew removes a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser from a slate blue leather gear bag.

18:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew examines a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

18:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew makes a selection on a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of white paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into his waiting hand.

18:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew puts a shiny silver plastic paper dispenser in a metallic silver messenger bag.

18:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew switches on a personal filing computer.

18:23 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "We probably should post that info from Jim somewhere."

18:24 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn navigates his slate blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:24 Wendy Arroyo says, "The Jimfo, if you will."

18:24 FCI Scout Morris Corlew puts down a sheet of white paper.

18:24 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "That's the one we been passin round."

                            OUTSIDER PATROL EVASION VIA NISSI VALDAIRE
                            
So a patrol is going along doing whatever the fuck it is Outsiders do when suddenly a ship signature shows up on their sensors. It's probably a pretty big signature, too, cause exploration ships are usually big and we're almost always at full trim. So they throw down their Outsider Go Fish cards or whatever and run to their control room. This is when they change direction and pick up speed, which is when you'll see them too.

Now remember, they also just saw you, you're pretty much at the maximum range they can detect you. So what you need to do immediately is reduce your signature. Yellow alert does that, so does reducing trim and turning off nonessential systems. At that moment they've lost you.

But they know the direction you were going and they know where they saw you, so they are going to check those areas, Which is why you also change direction. You need to find the quickest possible speed away from where they saw you, in a direction also that isn't going to run into them as they move. But pick your direction early and stick to it, You can wiggle it a little sure, but doubling back or going on a right angle is going to shrink the distance you achieve.

I've seen the Outsiders go straight to where they first sighted you and I've also seen them go out and try to intercept your original course and then double back.
18:24  Hope they try to intercept cause that gives you more time. But either way, Your goal is to be far enough away from where they first saw you that they can't pick up your reduced signature once they get there themselves.

At some point the computer will report that they're back on their original course, You just keep crawling away. And you can slowly increase trim. Don't go full bore all at once or you'll have to start all over. And that's about it, you'll sort of have to get a feel for it. Just don't freak out, Stay the course, literally. Even as they ping and ping and get closer than you can believe. Just as long as you save yourself enough time to turn weapons and stuff back on.

So Jim has talked with Ian today and told us that we're going to be passing pretty close to outsider space today. We should keep on alert of course, other than that, just keep relaxed.

Subject: How To Evade Patrols
Author: Nissi Valdaire
Posted: 16:26 25 April 2318 GST

Somebody wrote down something I said a few months ago and this person seems to know what they're talking about, so here you go.

                            OUTSIDER PATROL EVASION VIA NISSI VALDAIRE

So a patrol is going along doing whatever the fuck it is Outsiders do when suddenly a ship signature shows up on their sensors. It's probably a pretty big signature, too, cause exploration ships are usually big and we're almost always at full trim. So they throw down their Outsider Go Fish cards or whatever and run to their control room. This is when they change direction and pick up speed, which is when you'll see them too.

Now remember, they also just saw you, you're pretty much at the maximum range they can detect you. So what you need to do immediately is reduce your signature. Yellow alert does that, so does reducing trim and turning off nonessential systems. At that moment they've lost you.

But they know the direction you were going and they know where they saw you, so they are going to check those areas, Which is why you also change direction. You need to find the quickest possible speed away from where they saw you, in a direction also that isn't going to run into them as they move. But pick your direction early and stick to it, You can wiggle it a little sure, but doubling 
18:27 back or going on a right angle is going to shrink the distance you achieve.

I've seen the Outsiders go straight to where they first sighted you and I've also seen them go out and try to intercept your original course and then double back. Hope they try to intercept cause that gives you more time. But either way, Your goal is to be far enough away from where they first saw you that they can't pick up your reduced signature once they get there themselves.

At some point the computer will report that they're back on their original course, You just keep crawling away. And you can slowly increase trim. Don't go full bore all at once or you'll have to start all over. And that's about it, you'll sort of have to get a feel for it. Just don't freak out, Stay the course, literally. Even as they ping and ping and get closer than you can believe. Just as long as you save yourself enough time to turn weapons and stuff back on.

21:18 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:19 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "We have six EAOS techs, right?"

21:19 Wendy Arroyo says, "Yeah."

21:19 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Plus the three of us is 9 and, x from each alliance for initial landing squad."

21:21 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's neck.

21:21 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:21 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Pierre, with us and tech's we have 9. What's your thoughts on 1 or 2 from each alliance for initial landing team?"

21:22 Wendy Arroyo says, "Is this the diplomatic team or."

21:22 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "2 would take us up to 15."

21:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

21:22 An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

21:22 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I think."

21:23 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

21:23 Ali Candan asks, "Are you sure all techs would want to be on the landing team?"

21:23 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

21:23 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "We are thinking we all ought not get off the ship the moment we land. That's what I am asking about."

21:23 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

21:23 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Or were, who knows what he thinks now."

21:23 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:23 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah wouldn't be a good idea if we all come piling out of two big ships."

21:24 You nod.

21:24 I don't understand that.

21:24 Wendy Arroyo says, "Instead, let's come piling out of three or four."

21:24 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

21:24 You chuckle.

21:24 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "No, just one teensy one."

21:24 Wendy Arroyo says, "Nothing says we come in peace like a small flotilla landing."

21:24 You grin.

21:24 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "You know like in your teenager days when you'd see how many you could smush into a hovercar?"

21:25 You chuckle at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

21:25 FCI Scout Lily Kaise grins.

21:25 You say to Lily, "I never tried that."

21:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well it can be interesting. I had a shiny red one and so to christen it we...i don't know how many of us smushed into it until the beach patrol pulled me over and told me it wasn't quite legal or safe and whatnot."

21:27 You laugh at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

21:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

21:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe he is planning to just let everyone off the ship."

21:27 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels shrugs.

21:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Ah well, I'll roll with whatever."

21:27 You say, "Me too."

21:28 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I mean, if we are able to get confirmation from them before we land that we all can get out, fine but if not, I'd rather keep it small."

21:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I'll be a good girl though if we're all allowed to go and not say a word, keep my hands in my pockets and not speak unless directed to do otherwise."

21:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh totally agree."

21:28 You nod.

21:29 You nod to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

21:30 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Seems big enough. How do you want to pick?"

21:31 You say, "Rock paper scissors."

21:31 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:31 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I figure we each pick from our respective alliances. I think Alexander has got his."

21:32 Wendy Arroyo says, "Melinda will pick Melinda and Melinda."

21:32 You chuckle.

21:32 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well leas us out heh."

21:32 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "We'll sort you guys."

21:33 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:33 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I guess it would be subject to change if someone is asleep or if they give us all the go ahead to pile out. But it's probably good to have some idea as we are getting ever closer."

21:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I just want to prove to Eric Worst that he is totally wrong."

21:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

21:33 A Tardick lizard named Freyja turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

21:34 You grin at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

21:34 You exclaim, "Me too!"

21:34 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Oh my fucking god."

21:34 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Okay, but what about AEU people?"

21:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "Nothing for him to be wrong about except the fact of his bank accounts getting bigger. The rest is just for show."

21:34 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "AEU Government may throw me in jail when we get back but yeah."

21:35 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

21:35 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

21:35 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:35 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Katina, what's wrong?"

21:35 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I want to cry. A rift squid just took my workbench."

21:35 The voice of FCI Scout Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And he just gave it back."

21:35 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:35 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Huh."

21:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "So goes the ballad of Katina."

21:36 You nod.

21:36 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:36 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We be fair and pick 1 or 2 from AEU as well."

21:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Holy cow."

21:37 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, put Anfisa, Aisling and Ather on the list. Maybe they like robots."

21:37 Wendy Arroyo says, "That is a substantial amount more than one or two."

21:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "No it really isn't."

21:38 You say, "AnfisaandAisling arn't from the AEU."

21:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "It's 2 from his alliance and one from AEU?"

21:38 You nod.

21:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah they are mutuality."

21:38 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

21:38 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "This is just for initial landing team should we not be advised to all exit at once. We can sort any negotiation things later, if those get to happen."

21:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Heh yeah I love the favoritism but what else is new?"

21:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

21:38 Wendy Arroyo says, "Mhm, yes. To keep numbers small, we just jumped the number of people disembarking by three."

21:39 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We can trade Ather if they really like robots."

21:39 You say to Lily, "I figured Ather would go as he is an Ace."

21:39 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Ace status makes no difference."

21:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I figured Ather would go because he gets all the things."

21:40 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Unknown space now. Time to be more careful."
FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "That's half the crew at this rate."

21:40 You nod.

21:40 Wendy Arroyo nods. "The exact thing we set out not to do."

21:42 Melinda says to Wendy, "Suggestions were given, it's ultimately the choice of the liaisons and clearly he does not want to pick just one from his alliance."

21:42 Wendy Arroyo says, "I can only wonder why."

21:44 A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Well I could pick one, encourage Damien to just pick one and the Mutuality get two."

21:44 "Fair?" FCI Scout Melinda Michaels gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

21:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

21:45 Wendy Arroyo says, "Hey, suggestions were given, it's ultimately the choice of the liaisons."

21:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "It is."

21:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "But this one is asking."

21:46 Wendy Arroyo says, "All I'm saying is bringing a small army is a recipe for disaster, and all I hear is the number increasing."

21:46 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

21:49 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Well yeah I count 8 with The Liaisons, 2 Mutuality, 1 each League, Fringe and Ather that isn't huge."

21:49 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "But now that we know we have six EAOS techs along."

21:49 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "And they go automatically I am assuming."

21:49 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "True now they actually may want to go initially."

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz stretches.

21:50 You wave to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Ah, sofa, my love."

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz leans on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

21:50 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves to FCI Scout Keegan Wantz.

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz salutes sharply.

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Oh, right at 0%."

21:50 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Oh my."

21:53 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

21:55 A Tardick lizard named Freyja turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

21:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:56 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:57 Melinda says to Keegan, "We've been discussing landing people in case we are not given permission to all depart. We've got possibly six EAOS techs who automatically go and yeah."

21:58 Melinda says to Keegan, "Pierre is picking two from Mutuality and Ather from AEU. So we're up to twelve."

22:01 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Choices are to pick 1 from the remaining two alliances to keep us small or keep numbers equal and go with the 2 that he has gone with."

22:02 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Well, we are the in the unknown now."

22:02 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:02 The voice of FCI Scout Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We are."

22:03 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Why not have every rep pick two or something?"

22:03 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Let it not be said we were afraid to go off the known path."

22:03 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

22:04 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Could do it that way."

22:04 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "That would be fifteen."

22:04 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "However, it is possible AEU gets left out with that method."

22:05 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "If we all picked from alliances."

22:05 A Tardick lizard named Freyja, perched on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:06 I don't understand that.

22:06 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "One way is 17 and the way Nissi suggested would be 15."

22:06 Nissi Valdaire says, "Maybe the AEU should have had a rep too. But if you wanna push it to 17, you could come up with two AEU between you all."

22:06 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "I think that's correct."

22:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I don't really care one way or the other. I just hope that no matter how much you all despise us, that one of the AEU will be represented."

22:07 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Wait a minute."

22:07 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Nobody dispises the pilots."

22:07 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

22:07 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

22:07 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Despises."

22:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

22:08 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Do you think I really would have given you the chance to come if I despised you?"

22:08 "Well, yeah, I knew you hated my guts." You grin at FCI Scout Melinda Michaels. "Figured you were just going to strand me and leave me with the outsiders."

22:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:08 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I'm not certain what the actual decision-making was comprised of so I'd say that I hope not."

22:08 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Truthfully?"

22:09 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "You are here because I invited you."

22:09 You grin.

22:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles.

22:09 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "We made decisions against your government."

22:10 You nod and smile at FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

22:10 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "And we know full well that we get smack talked about us but still we brought you guys."

22:10 You say, "And we accepted against our government."

22:10 You nod to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

22:10 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yes we certainly accepted against our Government and I even put mine in writing to Ather."

22:11 You say, "So, I agree. There's no way Melinda would have invited us if she truly disliked us."

22:11 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Your government's treatment of unregs is not good and we took a stand on their behalf plus other reasons. We hoped our actions could help you guys speak out or something."

22:12 You nod to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels. "That's kind of what I figured."

22:13 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "You're all rogues again."

22:13 FCI Scout Keegan Wantz says, "Congratulations."

22:13 Nissi Valdaire says, "If this is about our policy... yeah, it basically comes down to the fact that every credit we help you guys make is 10 to 20 credits we helped Best make, and that's not something we really wanna be a part of, especially with our allies being who they are."

22:13 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels nods.

22:13 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh I was never a Rogue but yeah probably will be."

22:13 You say to Melinda, "I even said as much to one of the League pilots. That?I hoped our going on this trip would make a statment to the AEu government."

22:13 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

22:14 Melinda says to you, "I hope it will too."

22:14 You say, "Statement."

22:14 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "To further clarify."

22:14 You smile.

22:15 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "League is not trying to be bullies, assholes or whatever. We aren't trying to force you to do what we want you to do. We are just taking a stand against your government and hoped it would help you guys do the same."

22:15 You nod to FCI Scout Melinda Michaels.

22:16 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels says, "Because doing things like treating part of the human race as subhumans is unacceptable and that's what they are doing to the unregs."

22:16 You say, "I agree."

22:16 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

22:19 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Oh I totally agree Melinda and you know my perspective concerning Unregs."

22:19 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

22:19 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Have you guys spoke to your government about any of this?"

22:19 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yes we certainly have."

22:19 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels asks, "Any responses?"

22:21 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ahoy there, blackwing. How goes?"

22:22 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "They're just oblivious to us. You'd think that after docking the economy at least by 10 percent by interfering with Trade, that they would notice us."

22:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew lopes in from the south.

22:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew waves.

22:23 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves.

22:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

22:23 FCI Scout Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

22:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:24 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

22:25 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

22:25 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

22:28 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

22:28 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hello."

22:28 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hello."

22:30 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

22:32 A Tardick lizard named Freyja turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on FCI Scout Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

22:41 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

22:43 A Tardick lizard named Freyja flicks its tongue out from its perch on Wendy Arroyo's shoulder.

22:43 An Outsider patrol turns toward Sector Northwest and Up and increases speed.

22:44 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Medium."

22:44 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

22:44 You hear a "ping" sound as the ship's computer detects an active sensor sweep. The sound seems clear.

22:44 The voice of Damien Goss comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Patrol sighted, we are on purple alert now."

22:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

22:44 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels strides south.

22:44 You scramble to your feet.

22:44 You hear a wet tearing sound.
You gag slightly.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 135.0, 20.0.

22:44 Gonzales Bourne says into the PA microphone, "Trim us down please."

22:44 You hear a "ping" sound as the ship's computer detects an active sensor sweep. The sound seems clear.
Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Uh oh. Looks like we've got a bit of a problem."

22:45 You hear a wet tearing sound.

22:45 FCI Scout Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Trimmed to 50."

22:45 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Problem?"

22:45 Jim Gruffudd's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hold on, I have just the thing."

22:45 You hear a "ping" sound as the ship's computer detects an active sensor sweep. The sound seems clear.

22:45 The PA speakers crackle briefly, then a subdued but catchy electronic tune begins playing.

22:45 A quiet but relentless beat of electronic drum taps plays over the speakers.

22:45 Gonzales Bourne activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

22:45 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
