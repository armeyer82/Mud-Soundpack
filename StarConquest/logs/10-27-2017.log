01:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

09:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It could also just mean someone is hauling roids out of comms range or something like that."

09:42 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "This I know nothing about, but I do know you lost points. Could the loss of tesla stuff be related?"

09:43 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did you have the teslabucks after your point reduction happened?"

09:43 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Well, no big problem, just wondered, where have my 7 tesla credits gone."

09:44 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, stuff disappearing might be the penalty I guess, but yeah, 7 isn't much, so try not to worry about it."

09:44 [Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "True, but could have been, and I just didn't expect that."

09:45 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I asked if the disappeared at the same time as your points went down or after."
