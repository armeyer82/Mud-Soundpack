Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

The Torus docking bays consist of sterile silver-colored walls, floor, and
ceiling. Somehow, even with people coming and going constantly, the floor is
kept completely clean. An unknown technology allows the docking bay to remain
open to space while holding air. You see the bright glint of a solitary
blue-white star outside. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility is to
the east, and the starship supply store is to the west.
The three-person heavy cruiser "Refracted Reality", the one-person marauder
"Optic Nerve", the two-person syphon "Mentally Drained", the two-person asteroid
hauler "Smells Like Cheese", the one-person flitter "Back To Basics", the
one-person flitter "Typical", and the two-person light freighter "Sandbagger"

You've been in a lot of 99 credit stores in your day, but this one clearly takes
the cake. Untidy stacks of water-stained, fire-damaged and moth-eaten clothes,
bookworm-infested books, half-melted candles, pop culture throwbacks and various
Jesus-themed dinnerware litter the entire space. The narrow aisles are hardly
big enough to accomodate one person at a time, yet the store always seems to be
filled and busy. A loud kid fights with his sister over who gets the Ninja
playset and who has to play with the near-sentient can of beets. You're thrilled

You are standing upon a ledge only a few meters wide, which runs for a short
distance along Ixtapa's outer wall. You glance over the edge occasionally, but
your vision is obscured by mist and various city pollutions long before the
surface becomes visible. The section of ledge ends in a thick wall, which
extends upward to the top of the city. A nearby dark corner is partially eroded.

You find yourself standing in a corner formed by two of Ixtapa's outer walls,
which are effectively blocking out all sunlight. Squinting at the eroded
concrete, you notice more damage than was originally visible. In fact, something
has eaten a large tunnel through the concrete, and you see a dim light at the

A miniature city seems to have been built here, deep within Ixtapa. A cluster of
lights, some of them functional, has been suspended from the ceiling. Groups of
buildings of various sizes extend toward the back of the cavern, to the east.
Small, dark people glance at you suspiciously as they go about their obscure
business. Some barely-recognizable modern version of electronic music blasts
loudly from somewhere in the northern part of the cavern.
