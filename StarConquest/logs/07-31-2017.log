00:26:07 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'll come see what I can do about that."

00:26:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:26:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:26:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:26:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:26:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Hello there, EAOS Ion Rider Kappa! Welcome to home space!"

00:26:44 The ship is already moving.

00:26:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:26:46 Which sector did you mean?

00:26:46 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

00:26:48 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 568" has jumped out of the sector.

00:26:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:26:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:26:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

00:26:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:26:55 The computer reports that the three-person cannoneer "EAOS Ion Rider Kappa" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

00:26:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:26:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:26:56 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: $Z2X!wM#^J%o@E.T|{G=,2P!OdhT2)3$GGR|@*5A
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:26:57 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

00:26:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:27:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:27:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:27:01 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:27:02 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

00:27:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:27:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:27:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:27:06 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:27:07 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

00:27:08 Return to base signal received.  Your drone is now returning.  Arrival in approximately 1.60 minutes.

00:27:14 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2264 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southeast and Slightly Down."

00:27:15 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

00:27:19 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 7,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

00:27:19 [Enter `yes' or `no']

00:27:20 The one-person cargo hauler "Thanos" has fired a grapple into a medium-sized comet.

00:27:21 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 129,638.29 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:27:30 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:27:31 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:27:32 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:27:33 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:27:35 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:27:36 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

00:27:36 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

00:27:38 Your drone is continuing to return to base. Arrival in approximately 1.10 minutes.

00:27:41 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

00:27:43 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I can try and make a run for the watch tower if I rid of the asteroid."

00:27:50 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But i've never fired one of those."

00:34:42 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

00:34:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice! That's great."

00:34:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:34:45 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras laughs.

00:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "That's awesome. Great job. I need to go salvaging. I finished the vermin ground missions for now."

00:35:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good work."

00:35:05 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, scared of my little firestorm."

00:35:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm averagig about six hundred fifty thousand league credits a haul."

00:35:18 The computer reports that the two-person cipactli "Righteous Defense" has exited the riftflow.

00:35:18 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Maybe they have been dremaing of it too."

00:35:21 Via general sector communication, League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Welcome to Asteroid beacon 285. You can find a repair and recharge station with a long-range laser here that is to be used for defense of the sector. Please be aware of friendly fire. Your way home is 286. Fly safe!"

00:35:22 [Tactical Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I didn't get to scare 'em off with my cipactli."

00:35:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's awesome!"

00:35:29 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Hi!"

00:35:34 Via general sector communication, Righteous Defense transmits a text-based transmission: "hi!"

00:35:52 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

00:35:52 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:35:56 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Farewell."

00:36:02 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:36:03 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:36:04 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:36:05 The starship has left a unique area of space.

00:36:06 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "They sure as hell weren't scared of my isotope and the bastards were waiting just outside the asteroid processor. I launched and immediately got zeroed in on."

00:36:13 Listen. You need to be careful.

00:36:30 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lordy, The Rocks!". The organization has earned 440,342.69 credits.

00:36:30 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well...Uh. that was a fun trip. I guess?"

00:36:37 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

00:36:43 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You could punch transfer to make it worth it....for me."

00:36:51 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras laughs.

00:37:07 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Just did."

00:37:18 Lileah Rose says to you, "we should try asteroid hauling to get you some points. We have a station right here in this sector and there is one in 17. I think I've only hauled from here"

00:37:29 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Of course."

00:37:35 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I take back all the stuff I didn't say about you."

00:37:40 Lileah Rose exclaims, "I've only hauled like 16 so I'm not a hauling cowgirl!"

00:37:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:37:43 Lileah Rose laughs.

00:37:44 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Aww thank you."

00:37:47 You grin at Lileah Rose.

00:37:49 You say, "We should"

00:37:52 Lileah Rose smiles.

00:37:56 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But no seriously thanks."

00:37:59 Lileah Rose says, "they are worth 2 points each"

00:38:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Is it best to try to keep your points as even as possible, or does it not entirely matter?"

00:38:05 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sure thing."

00:38:11 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Now to compose the poem in honor of my mighty battle with the pirates."

00:38:13 You grin.

00:38:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Why have we not had a Vernos poem yet?"

00:38:25 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:38:29 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Cause I was waiting for the right moment."

00:38:46 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If I make a vernos poem, I want to make sure I offend the maximum number of people."

00:38:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't really matter much. I would just suggest picking some goals and working toward them."

00:39:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if you really want a rift drive, or a faster engine, or what have you."

00:39:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do think they limit cadets' exploration points to 30 if you have fewer than 300 industry."

00:39:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There once was a isotope hauling, when pirates came a'calling, they blew off my bits, for the hull of it, and they sent me home totally bawling."

00:39:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But that's the only limitation like that that I know of."

00:39:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:40:02 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hmm also too, vernos is a harder one. I like to give some thought to those."

00:40:41 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well harder is sometimes a good thing."

00:40:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I'll admit I'm scared of exploration too. I don't want to get lost, and I'm not entirely comfortable with the coordinate numbers and where they position me, so... I probably won't do that either. Only vermin missions I'm comfortable with are ground at present. It's why I think my ground might climb higher."

00:41:08 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yes, but we're not going to talk about that. I already have shule honing for a box."

00:41:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:41:28 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Lily certainly would not be cool with that."

00:41:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Shhhh. If he's in the box, no one knows."

00:41:51 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

00:42:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "But no, let's try this."

00:42:12 Lileah Rose asks, "so when I finish this site and you yours. would you like to go haul some?"

00:42:15 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

00:44:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But there's nothing wrong with focusing on ground, either. There's lots of ground work that needs doing."

00:44:04 You say, "I won't start another site then. I'll just wait."

00:44:29 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well lexie's a moron, I've never seen that repair all damage option before. I need to learn to read."

00:44:30 Lileah Rose exclaims, "if we do only 10, that means 20 points for you and of course more is gravy!"

00:44:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

00:44:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:44:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Saira, if you do get into uncharted sectors and get lost, just ask for help. We can try to find you."

00:44:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Uh. I mean...nah. you so aren't lexie. you're the smartest person in the fringe..."

00:45:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "That would be awesome. Thank you! Whenever you can is fine. I'm in no rush. Just salvaging and will be reading later."

00:45:04 You grin.

00:45:06 Lileah Rose says, "you need I think it is 80 to get the big debris/trading ship"

00:45:08 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The spaceport techinicians will thank you for that."

00:47:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:47:19 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

00:47:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:47:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

00:47:28 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No one thanks the spaceport repair folks though. They just order the repairs, wait for them to be done then says screw off."

00:47:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:47:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh look they're repairing my ship and talking bad about me."

00:47:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:47:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I often thank them. They do super hard work. Specially when we kick the crap out of our ships."

00:47:56 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "They always run away so fast. I would thank them if they'd stand around with their hammers outside my ship."

00:48:07 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:48:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Trust me, I like those guys. I'm making them wealthy."

00:48:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eh, we got decent pay. Nothing like pilots get though."

00:51:13 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

00:52:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well I"m going to take myself away from the disputes between the protectors and the service people that make that possible."

00:52:25 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Be safe."

00:54:07 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm actually more impressed at how fast the repair crews work. They do an excellent job."

00:54:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule, are you busy?"

00:55:01 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if I have the time to mess with deploying the accelerators."

00:55:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Would you mind deploying them?"

00:56:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits over the sound of buttons being tapped, "And... back to New Earth to transfer... why is my ship moving without my say so...?"

00:57:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "New Earth and a lot of other planets and stations have auto-landers."

00:57:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Some locations have autobeacons that will have your ship automatically move towards them if you don't input any commands."

00:57:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a kind of safety feature. If you do nothing the autolander will pull you right in."

00:57:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can turn this feature off if you want, by pressing the settings button on your control console."

00:57:52 Lileah Rose removes a small payment slip from a small cloth sack.

00:58:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "That's handy. Also good at making cadets think their ships are possessed, but hey. Gotta have humour."

00:58:06 Lileah Rose crumples up her letter and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

00:58:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

00:58:23 Lileah Rose removes a point summary printout from a small cloth sack.

00:59:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

00:59:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I don't mind having it on, especially since now I'm fairly sure my ship won't fly itself into a star or something."

00:59:16 Lileah Rose vigorously rubs a point summary printout in her hands.  It bursts into flames and instantaneously disappears.

00:59:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, it suprised me at first too."

01:00:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira laughs over the sound of something falling. "I'm sure the engineers got a kick out of it. Hey, Bob, let's do this, but shh, don't tell the cadets. Let's see how many freak and drink to each."

01:00:55 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Dear lordy, have mercy."

01:00:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira oomphs.

01:01:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Which level of lordy is that?"

01:01:09 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

01:01:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im going to have to hunt for a location that might have even higher grade debris then Orion. I'm pretty close to getting a better grapple."

01:01:21 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "It is not a level of lordy."

01:01:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach gasps.

01:01:28 Lileah Rose removes a point summary printout from a handbag.

01:01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Tara, I'm going to find a way to siphon out all your knowledge. How'd you learn it all so fast?"

01:01:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "777 is great for salvaging."

01:01:54 Lileah Rose vigorously rubs a point summary printout in her hands.  It bursts into flames and instantaneously disappears.

01:02:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I've been listening to peoples advise and just testing things as much as I can, really."

01:02:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Can't be afraid to take risks."

01:02:27 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:02:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So just so that I don't ruin this."

01:02:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira hms quietly. "Suppose so."

01:03:03 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How do I input the plus and reverse vectors into the rift inserter?"

01:03:27 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

01:03:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There's a rift button up in the control room. You put the heading in there. The station will calculate the rest."

01:04:01 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lordy, oh lordy, good lordy, great lordy, oh shit and oh hell no I believe were the levels of lordy."

01:04:07 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks!"

01:04:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

01:04:27 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:04:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You're welcome dude."

01:04:50 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I suppose dear lordy would rank somewhere between good lordy and great lordy."

01:05:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

01:05:27 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

01:05:34 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You should write out the levels of lordy on a plaque, and have them in the control room of your gunship."

01:05:50 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Fuck that shit is not techinally a level of lordy but if I ever say it, lordy just did not cover it."

01:06:59 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That will most likely be reserved for my first encounter with an arbritator."

01:07:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

01:07:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "BUt yeah, the more you do stuff, the more comfortable you get it, but if you want a some advise, your ship cordinates work like this: X, Y, Z. The starmap on the left shows X and Y, while the one on the right shows X and Z."

01:08:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So the exact center of a sector is 10, 10, 10."

01:09:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The starmap also shows some references that indicate where 1, and 20 is."

01:09:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's an arbitaterr? Is that like some sort of uber potato?"

01:09:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Ah..."

01:09:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.

01:09:57 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yep they grow them on telex."

01:10:28 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:10:33 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

01:10:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "This asteroid has a lot of gold in it, seesh."

01:11:14 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos". The organization has earned 73,497.78 credits.

01:11:28 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

01:11:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also, if the starmap is too much information for you, there's a button right near there marked "RUnDOWN" That will just ive you a list of the things' coordinates in a sector."

01:12:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's all a matter of preference, really."

01:12:28 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:13:28 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

01:14:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I'm reading this industry book now. Perhaps it'll offer me some suggestions. I'm not good with numbers. I expect certain space activities will never be easy due to that. We'll see if I can contribute in other ways."

01:14:28 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:15:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You'd think that. Though to be honest, I thought the same way when I was a cadet, but I've gotten to where Ican do pretty much every activity."

01:15:28 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

01:15:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "AeuTime, I suppose."

01:15:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's often ways to simplify. And things are often more complicated looking than they really are."

01:16:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, some poor pirate must have gotten their sensor array blasted off."

01:16:12 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lordy, The Rocks!". The organization has earned 672,818.74 credits and 1 megacredit.

01:16:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like rifting for example. When the rift drive was first released, I said 'There's no way I'm going to be able to do this..' But now I rift like a champ."

01:16:28 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

01:16:29 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:16:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Rifting?"

01:16:33 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

01:16:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The rift is very cool. Besides the random, forced thoughts."

01:16:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Is that like jumping?"

01:17:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its like, a form of extra-dimensional FTL travel, Saira."

01:17:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, it's not like jumping at all. It's entering a werid plane of existance. The drive can use the energies there to go very, very fast."

01:17:28 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

01:18:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits a long silence punctuated by the rifling of pages before a confused voice simply states, "I see."

01:18:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rifting is best understood when you experience it, to be honest."

01:18:28 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:18:33 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

01:18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, and Tara only got a small taste of it."

01:18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "A wooden ship was very different."

01:19:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But we're talking thousands of lightminutes per second here."

01:19:28 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods south.

01:19:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, that's insane."

01:19:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits in a neutral tone, "That's... very fast. Indeed."

01:20:12 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

01:20:20 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos". The organization has earned 76,210.59 credits.

01:21:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So that's what was meant by headings."

01:21:31 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

01:21:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, Tara. I meant to have you check out the controls while were doing that, but it slipped my mind with all the other stuff."

01:21:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Always another time."

01:22:08 You smile at Lileah Rose.

01:22:10 Your card slides back out of the slot. You take it and stand up.

01:32:38 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:32:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

01:32:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:32:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You can get them in the supply store of most starports."

01:32:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:32:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:32:51 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:32:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Why not carry multiple?"

01:32:58 [MTTS] Butchulla: Don't worry, I get it. Typing is really, really hard sometimes.

01:32:59 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

01:33:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:33:03 The reactionless drive emits a deep hum as the ship moves.

01:33:23 The thrumming of the engines slowly changes pitch as the starship moves.

01:33:26 You say, "Ah, ok"

01:33:27 The starship's hull creaks slightly as it moves.

01:33:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:33:29 You turn on the quiet running feature.

01:33:31 You notice Lileah Rose using the radio to ask for docking clearance.

01:33:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can carry as many as you need. I carry a couple, but I've never used one so I don't know how much charge they provide."

01:33:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Little Rocker.  The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:33:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:33:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:33:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not much, they're more for emergencies."

01:33:48 Lileah Rose pulls a large lever towards her.

01:33:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:33:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess if you ran out of juice very far away you might need several, but I don't know."

01:46:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:46:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:47:08 Lileah Rose says, "you will eventually need a navaid and a jet i just forget where to get those"

01:47:14 You say, "Ah, ok"

01:47:29 Lileah Rose says, "you don't have the points yet so no worries, we'll get them when time comes"

01:49:50 Lileah Rose presses a large button marked CYCLE.

01:49:53 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

01:49:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sure I could use a change of pace, been salvaging all day."

01:49:55 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow.  Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

01:50:05 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

01:50:05 Lileah Rose holds your hand, taking you into her group.

01:50:06 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

01:50:07 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

01:50:50 -------------------------
Help on: Asteroid-hauling
-------------------------
The Art of Asteroid Hauling
---------------------------

Out in uncharted space are extremely large asteroids, big enough to land a ship on.  These asteroids possess resources and valuable rare materials far beyond any simple piece of debris.

The Intersector Space Resources Commission has decided that it wants these valuable objects.  Using a new unique starship design and newly-designed equipment, asteroids can now be hauled into Known Space and harvested for their resources.

Introducing the asteroid hauler.  This two-person craft is designed specifically to go out and locate new asteroids, land on them, attach lines and anchors, and haul them back to a space station equipped to make use of them.

Although this operation proceeds much faster with two people aboard, one determined pilot can also reap the benefits.  Bringing in an asteroid will net the occupants of the ship anywhere from 2 to 7 million credits, and the crew will each also receive two starship license points for their trouble.

Be warned, though, that a second asteroid hauler could conceivably detach your anchors and haul your asteroid away.  The credit for bringing it in goes to whoever sends the asteroid along its final trajectory into the space station's collection bay.

The following space stations are now accepting asteroids:

Experimental Research Structure (EAOS)
Capella Station (EAOS)
Sector 8 Outpost (League)
L5 Station (League)
Sector 17 Station Alpha (AEU)
Sector 21 Station Delta (AEU)
Meredith Station (Fringe)
Evia Station (Fringe)

Good luck to the pilots and station workers involved in this ambitious new project.

---------------------------
How To
---------------------------

If you want to be a 'roid cowboy, you need two kinds of supplies: anchors and lines.  Anchors bite into the surface of the asteroid, becoming nearly unremovable.  Lines are tied to the anchors and help to attach the asteroid to the ship.  Also, of course, only an asteroid hauler is designed to move asteroids.

Anchors must be placed in a particular formation: north, south, east, and west of your ship.

You will need two lines.  One is tied to the north and south anchors, and the other is tied to the east and west anchors.

Once the four anchors and two lines are secure, you must reenter your ship and use the ANCHOR function.  This deploys the ship's own anchors, adding a second layer of security while the asteroid moves.

Next, use the HAUL function.  You will choose from a list of valid collector stations.  Keep note of the nearest collector station as you hunt for asteroids (in fact, you probably want to search using a collector station as a base).  Your ship will use its engines to move the asteroid, and the wormhole drive will be unavailable.  If your collector station is quite a distance away, it
01:50:50  can take some time to travel there.

If at any time you need to stop the movement of the asteroid, use the standard STOP function.  After a moment, the asteroid will gradually cease its movements.

When your asteroid arrives near the collector station, workers on the station will pull it the rest of the way into the collector bay.  At this time, your ship will be automatically pulled into the station's docking bay.  Any supplies recovered from the asteroid will be placed here as well.

Note that asteroid hauling is best performed with a crew of two.  The rewards are given out with this in mind.  Thus, the reward system works this way:

One person: The standard fee is received.
Two people: The crew members each receive the standard fee.
More than two people:  The standard fee is doubled, then divided evenly among all crew members.

Good luck as a 'roid cowboy!

01:50:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Sure, why not. Just reading, and I could always use practice."

01:51:25 You nod.

01:52:00 Lileah Rose says, "ok then you can do this one and then the one west of the hauler and meet me over there. Forgot to get you a key and i'll unlock it when we go back"

01:52:06 You say, "so, anchors north, south, east, and west of the ship and ocnnect lines."

01:52:08 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

01:52:15 Lileah Rose disbands her group.

01:52:18 Lileah Rose just went northwest.

01:52:18 A spherical security drone hovers out of the area, following closely behind Lileah Rose.

01:52:51 I see no "anchor" here.

01:52:53 You open an asteroid hauling supply kit.

01:52:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm at the lounge on new earth, Vernos."

01:52:57 You remove an asteroid anchor from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

01:53:00 You lower an asteroid anchor to the ground and press a button on its side.  The anchor seeks the best angle downwards.

01:53:00 (12 seconds roundtime.)

01:53:12 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

01:53:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

01:53:17 I don't understand that.

01:53:19 You remove a coil of neutronium-threaded line from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

01:53:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Be right there."

01:53:21 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

01:54:42 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

01:54:46 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

01:54:47 (50 seconds roundtime.)

01:55:36 You step back and look over your shoulder, and see that the line, now secured to two anchors, stretches nicely over your ship.  Hopefully it will hold.

01:55:41 [Asteroid Surface]

01:55:41 The two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker" is parked here.
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

01:55:57 Lileah Rose just arrived.

01:55:57 A spherical security drone hovers into the area, following closely behind Lileah Rose.
A shiny blue medical drone hovers into the area, following closely behind Lileah Rose.

01:56:04 Lileah Rose beams at you.

01:56:08 You smile.

01:56:17 Lileah Rose deftly presses a button on a "Little Rocker" key.

01:56:17 Some lights on the two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker" suddenly flash several times.

01:56:20 Lileah Rose says, "there we go"

01:56:23 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Airlock]

01:56:24 You can go out and into the ship.

01:56:28 Lileah Rose just boarded the ship.

01:56:28 A spherical security drone hovers into the area, following closely behind Lileah Rose.
A shiny blue medical drone hovers into the area, following closely behind Lileah Rose.

01:56:32 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

01:56:35 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

01:56:37 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow.  Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

01:56:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Room for one."

01:56:47 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

01:56:48 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

01:56:49 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

01:56:50 Lileah Rose just entered the ship.

01:56:50 A spherical security drone hovers out of the area, following closely behind Lileah Rose.
A shiny blue medical drone hovers out of the area, following closely behind Lileah Rose.

01:56:51 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Control Room]
You see a large beanbag chair, a sector debris scanner, an AutoVector navigation unit, and a starship simulator here.
Lileah Rose is here.
A spherical security drone and a shiny blue medical drone are following behind Lileah.
You can go up and out.

01:56:53 Lileah Rose presses a button to deploy the ship's anchor.

01:56:53 A sharp crack is heard throughout the ship as the anchors on either side deploy with explosive force, biting deep into the surface of the asteroid.

01:56:55 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit, do you wish to unsuit now?

01:56:55 [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:56:56 You remove the elements of your spacesuit and fold them neatly into a standard starship flightbag.

01:57:00 You sit down on a large beanbag chair.

01:57:13 The ship's engines fire, and the anchored asteroid gradually begins to move toward Space Station Delta.

01:57:14 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately two sectors from its destination.

01:57:26 Lileah Rose says, "it's the sixth one or space station delta"

01:57:31 Lileah Rose sits down on a large beanbag chair.

01:57:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure. Can I engineer?"

01:58:04 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:58:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:58:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:58:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:58:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:58:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:58:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:58:19 You say, "Ah, ok"

01:58:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:58:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eve already asked. Talk to her."

01:58:26 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately one sector from its destination.

01:58:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:58:30 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:58:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:58:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:58:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:58:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:58:37 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:58:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:58:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:58:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:58:42 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:58:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok."

01:58:42 I don't understand that.

01:58:44 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

01:58:46 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

01:58:47 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

01:58:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:58:58 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

01:58:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:58:58 Current overall point level: 2
Current combat point level: 0

01:58:58 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:59:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:59:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:59:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:59:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:59:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:59:20 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:59:44 The computer reports that the asteroid is less than one sector from its destination.

01:59:50 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We are in the lounge."

02:00:37 As the asteroid falls into the station's collection bay, your ship detaches and heads for the docking bay.

02:00:37 You receive 5050000.00 AEU credits for this asteroid!

02:00:45 You stand up.

02:00:48 Lileah Rose says, "not bad how much did you earn"

02:00:51 Lileah Rose stands up.

02:03:38 This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

Help on: Communicators
----------------------
Two-Way FTL Communicators

Two-way FTL communicators allow two players to communicate from anywhere.  They are sold in pairs.

To use them:
USE <communicator name> WITH <message>.

Metachannel FTL Communicators

Metachannel FTL communicators allow any number of players to communicate simultaneously.  There are two options available:  general communication, which includes every player, and communication among your alliance.
NO CHANNEL ANYWHERE IS DESIGNED TO BE AN OUT OF CHARACTER CHANNEL. REMAIN IN CHARACTER ON ALL COMM CHANNELS AT ALL TIMES.

To use a metachannel FTL communicator:
TURN <communicator name> turns your communicator off and on.

   General:
    GENERAL <communicator name> turns general communication for you off and on.
 TRANSMIT GENERAL <message> will send your message over general communication.

   Alliance:
       Your alliance communication is on whenever your comm is.
    There are two alliance channel modes:  single and tuner.
    TUNE <communicator name> TO <channel number>.  Valid channels are 1 to 10, and 0 for tuner.
             Single-channel:
             TRANSMIT  <message> will transmit on the channel your communicator is tuned to.
           Tuner:
              TRANSMIT <channel number> <message> will transmit on the channel you specify.

Metafrequency FTL Transmitters

An FTL transmitter allows a group of any number 
03:24:36 of players to maintain personal radio contact with one another, regardless of alliance, via a previously decided upon frequency.

To use a metafrequency FTL transmitter:
TURN TRANSMITTER ON/TURN TRANSMITTER OFF turns the power on and off, accordingly.

TUNE TRANSMITTER TO <frequency> will tune the transmitter to the desired frequency.  The range of valid transmitter frequencies is currently 1.01 to 599.99.

USE TRANSMITTER WITH <message> transmits your message to every transmitter tuned to the same frequency as you.

CHECK TRANSMITTER tells you what frequency your transmitter is tuned to.

Finally, metafrequency transmitters also offer an earpiece option, for discreet listening.  To utilize an earpiece, simply ATTACH it to the transmitter.  While the transmitter is on your person and supports an earpiece, all messages from the transmitter will be relayed to you only.  When you are done using an earpiece, DETACH it from the metafrequency FTL transmitter.

03:28:04 You say, "Ah, ok"

03:28:22 Lileah Rose says, "so you might not yet understand what it says but you can usually make out the sector it is in"

03:28:30 You nod.

03:28:48 Lileah Rose says, "it generally remains for a number of hours and it will announce when it is going to leave"

03:28:59 You notice Lileah Rose using the radio to ask for launch clearance.

03:29:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Little Rocker, you have clearance to undock.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:29:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:29:05 You say, "Ah, ok"

03:29:09 Lileah Rose asks, "so we'll do a couple more and go find the shp?"

03:29:13 Lileah Rose grins.

03:29:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:29:16 You grin.

05:17:11 You smile.

05:17:17 You say, "That would be nice."

05:17:46 Lileah Rose says, "so rule of thumb is if you need EAOS credits, then you would want to transfer your salcage on one of their planets and so on"

05:17:51 Lileah Rose says, "salvage"

05:17:51 You nod.

05:18:27 Lileah Rose says, "I should have split up what I gave you but you probably won't need a lot of EAOS unless you go shopping over there"

07:59:11 [MTTS] Ulias: Does putting photos in an album reduce bloat level?

08:00:59 [MTTS] Squidmind: Somewhat. It reduces the object count at least.

08:01:16 [MTTS] Ulias: Ah, ok. Well at least that's something.

08:02:03 [MTTS] something: Are ship titles something that can be compressed? It was just a thought I just had, considering everyone has loads of them.

08:02:51 [MTTS] Squidmind: Not with the way ship ownership currently works.

08:03:16 [MTTS] usfolks: Sure would be nice to get rid of those titles...and keys. Oh lord the keys...

08:04:06 [MTTS] Squidmind: Titles have minimal overhead as individual objects go anyway. Photos and letters are the worst.

08:04:42 [MTTS] Squidmind: Filing computers, too.

08:05:28 [MTTS] usfolks: So...my using the filing computer instead of letters is no better than keeping all the pieces of paper in terms of the database, just in my measurement of bloat level?

08:05:33 [MTTS] Butchulla: This is good to know. I try to clean things out at least once a week, but sometimes it's like...Hell, where do I start.

08:05:52 [MTTS] Squidmind: The fifth largest object in the game is somebody's filing computer. Ahead of things like the point of interest database and the entire support ticket system.

08:06:05 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh I do hope it's not mine...it's pretty crowded...

08:06:15 [MTTS] Squidmind: Text is very bloaty.

08:06:19 [MTTS] Ulias: Hahaha, I do'nt nkow why that makes me laugh, but it does. I have a suspcion I know which character's it is.

08:07:02 [MTTS] something: For the sake of blote, would it be better to emote using the filing computer, and just have all that text on your actual computer?

08:07:12 [MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, I can think of a few whose might be worse than mine. I try to keep stuff on my actual computer, but a lot of things I roleplay the computer anyway, so might as well have it in there.

08:07:30 [MTTS] Squidmind: They need a better solution anyway.

08:08:16 [MTTS] something: I coppy pasted single pages of books into mine to avoid having to keep the entire book cause I thought it was less bloty...

08:08:20 [MTTS] usfolks: I think...at least for my part, I'm a data hoarder. I have backups of my backups of my backups. So keeping something in-game seems somehow safer than files on my computer.

08:08:43 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, I used to keep things just on my computer, but I've lost so many things so many times.

08:08:52 [MTTS] Squidmind: Books export their text, they're quite streamlined these days.

08:09:08 [MTTS] something: Ah.

08:09:14 [MTTS] usfolks: Good. I don't feel quite as bad about my char's book collection then. Heh.

08:09:37 [MTTS] kayden: Is it not like if your not reading it then the info isnt stored or something?

08:09:55 [MTTS] Ulias: I just keep teetering between moderate bloat and moderately excessive. I'm trying to at least keep it at moderate.

08:10:43 [MTTS] usfolks: I don't even remember when I was last at moderate. But when I went to excessive I freaked out a bit.

08:10:48 [MTTS] Squidmind: The text is hashed, the books store the hash and use it to grab the text from an external file on demand.

08:10:52 [MTTS] Ulias: I bet it's more like, the text for each book isn't in the book itself and all pulls from the same piece of text.

08:10:55 [MTTS] something: I keep trying to get it under moderate but there's just a lot of stuff that either seems like a cool roleplay prop or is actually useful.

08:11:03 [MTTS] Butchulla: I try to do the same thing. I try to be very conscious of the poor server.

08:11:05 [MTTS] Ulias: Quidmind put it better, of course.

08:11:55 [MTTS] Squidmind: Database size versus processing time, the eternal battle.

08:12:06 [MTTS] Butchulla: I hear ya.

08:12:15 [MTTS] something: How large is the database, at the moment?

08:12:17 [MTTS] usfolks: I've heard that discussed before on MTTS.

08:12:21 [MTTS] something: Very curious.

08:12:48 [MTTS] Squidmind: Just over 300mb.

08:13:40 [MTTS] Butchulla: I was waiting for something like, 700 MB. I'm certainly glad it is not that.

08:14:22 [MTTS] Ulias: I know one thing, SSN certainly does not help me keep my bloat down. I get my stuff cleaned out, and before you know it I've ordered like ten more things from SSN.

08:14:53 [MTTS] something: I wonder how muds with the players in the hundreds at a time deal wiht bloat.

08:14:58 [MTTS] usfolks: I've wondered if the gifting thing has significantly increased bloat. When people send each other 10 of an item randomly, it can't help.

08:15:03 [MTTS] Butchulla: SSN is that lovable thing that you want to hate, but can't.

08:15:56 [MTTS] Squidmind: SSN was such a hilariously stupid and bizarrely successful addition that I can't imagine getting rid of it.

08:16:24 [MTTS] usfolks: Not to mention the exclusive items.

08:16:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 8,703,703.70 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the three-person clipper "Thalassocracy".

08:16:32 [MTTS] Butchulla: Oh please don't. I'd rather bari every day and invasions every week, than losing SSN.

08:16:52 [MTTS] something: Somehow, even in text, the pull of the shopping channel is irresistible.

08:17:02 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah SSN is super cool, please don't ever lose that.

08:17:32 [MTTS] usfolks: Come now. Bari and invasions are FUN! Just don't do what that other host did and threaten to replace events with invasions. PLEASE?

08:18:27 [MTTS] Butchulla: No, please no. I would beg the wonderful squid never to do that.

08:20:08 [MTTS] usfolks: If said host were to replace plots...oh yeah, was plots, sorry...with invasions, it would make me quite sad. Fortunately the Squidmind has quite the sense of humor.

08:44:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "This pilot is crazy, I want a replacement."

08:44:55 [General Communication] Constantine Stone gasps.

08:47:28 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

08:47:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. That's an idea. Zeus can engineer. Little blue can fly. And goldenpants can gun."

08:48:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! That's Sir goldenpants."

08:48:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah...but he likes me, I figured he wouldn't mind goldenpants from me."

08:49:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He likes you, but we are all lowly peasants to Sir goldenpants."

08:49:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

08:50:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He may seem all sweet during the day, but at night he sneaks out and commits atrocities."

08:50:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ah. So now I know where he and cheeky sneak off to."

08:55:20 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

08:55:32 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach gasps.

08:55:39 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What happened?"

08:55:53 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I see how it is. Eli. I see how it is."

08:56:32 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What?"

08:56:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What did I do now?"

08:56:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Right as I walked out of the clipper, off flew soul. I'll remember that."

08:56:55 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach sniffles.

08:57:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hye, I'm not omniscient."

08:57:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

08:57:46 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You do realize I'm kidding around with you, right?"

08:58:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, I don't take any chances with you and your evil ways."

08:58:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cackles!

08:58:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You learn fast."

09:16:47 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Evenia, do you guys have any message beacons on hand?"

09:17:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Message tops?"

09:17:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

09:17:26 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe I didn't know what to look for."

09:17:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I can put one or 3 on a ship for you. What ship, and how many?"

09:17:52 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you could put one on herding cats, that would be amazing."

09:22:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Done."

09:22:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome! Thank you."

09:22:53 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You're very welcome."

09:27:06 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Eli. You wished to speak."

09:27:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, please."

09:27:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Are you on Helios?"

09:28:27 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Negative."

12:10:40 Lileah Rose smiles.

12:11:13 Lileah Rose says to you, "me too. I was hoping you might be awake but didn't know if our sleep pattern would be the same."

12:11:19 You nod.

12:11:20 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

12:11:21 You smile.

12:11:49 Lileah Rose says to you, "do you have any questions though about anything before I have to go?"

12:12:13 You ponder for a moment and reflect.

12:12:17 You say, "I don't think so."

12:12:46 Lileah Rose says, "ok just use the alliance l alliance"

12:13:09 You nod.

12:13:20 Lileah Rose says, "use the alliance gadget to check where some sectors are and you should be ok."

12:13:40 You smile.

12:13:45 You say, "Will dol."

12:13:52 You say, "will do"

12:14:03 Lileah Rose squeezes you affectionately.

12:14:26 Lileah Rose says, "ok then be safe! i'll see you later."

12:14:31 Lileah Rose kisses you.

12:14:31 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Whoever's supposed to do the salvage processor at Orion, if anyone is, and if that person is here...it's time to do it."

12:14:32 You say, "ok, take care"

12:14:37 I don't see "lilieah" here.

12:14:40 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh fuck."

12:14:42 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

12:14:47 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You too."

12:14:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah...Um. I'm on that."

12:14:50 Lileah Rose kisses you on the lips.

12:15:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I totally forgot about the thing."

12:15:41 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Most people do, until it's not there, and then they whine."

12:16:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I do not whine. I use that thing all the time."

12:17:25 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Do you have debris in something to get the new one started?"

12:17:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It doesn't need it, it's not a burner anymore."

12:17:50 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Oh, that's right. Never mind me."

12:17:54 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence yawns.

12:17:59 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I never do."

12:18:13 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You should try it sometime."

12:18:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. You're late."

12:18:58 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But but I dfon't want to!"

12:19:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't want to."

12:19:07 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Lazy ass."

12:19:21 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

12:19:25 You glance at your communicator's screen.

12:19:25 There is one board post.

12:19:56 You stand up.

12:19:58 You stretch.

12:20:11 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters Block Alpha]

12:20:11 You can go north, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

12:20:14 Go where?

12:20:17 You remove a pair of blue corduroy jeans from a backpack.

12:20:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Someone quickly tell me, is there an auto lander thing in Orion?"

12:20:19 You pull a pair of blue corduroy jeans on over your legs.

12:20:28 What?

12:20:30 You remove a grey vee-neck shirt from a backpack.

12:20:34 You pull a grey vee-neck shirt on over your head.

12:20:36 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I...don't think so."

12:20:44 You remove some black leather boots from a leather briefcase.

12:20:45 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I can come find out."

12:20:47 You put some black leather boots on your feet.

12:21:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:21:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:21:07 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:21:07 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:21:13 You peer out...

12:21:13 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den", the one-person cargo hauler "Windflight", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

12:21:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:21:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:21:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:21:29 The ship is already moving.

12:21:31 The ship is already moving.

12:21:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:21:31 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "By the look of it, I think Mel wants one used as the top for the processor."

12:21:32 Which sector did you mean?

12:21:32 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

12:21:33 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:21:33 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:21:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

12:21:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:21:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:21:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:21:40 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: +!'sr:ErgQ}"vFkrFaCVbs$:.VuW-Psq:fhB]5=M
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:21:41 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

12:21:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:21:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:21:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:21:45 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:21:46 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

12:21:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:21:49 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "There's not one here."

12:21:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:21:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:21:50 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:21:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

12:21:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:21:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:21:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:21:58 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

12:21:58 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2371 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northnortheast and Slightly Up."

12:21:59 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

12:22:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:22:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:22:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

12:22:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:22:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:22:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:22:10 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:22:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

12:22:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:22:13 The starship is already moving.

12:22:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:22:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:22:15 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:22:16 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

12:22:16 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

12:22:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

12:22:19 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:22:27 [Starship "Blueberry"; Corridor Beta]

12:22:28 You can go east, west, up, and down.

12:22:28 [Starship "Blueberry"; Corridor Gamma]

12:22:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:22:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:22:46 Some lights on the one-person flitter "Flounder" suddenly flash several times.

12:22:46 [Starship "Flounder"; Airlock]
You can go out and into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:22:48 [Starship "Flounder"; Control Room]

12:22:48 You can go down and out.

12:22:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

12:22:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:23:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:23:03 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:23:03 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:23:07 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:23:10 You punch a few commands into your personal credit assistant and receive the following display:

12:23:10

12:23:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:23:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:23:19 For a top, you are wearing a grey vee-neck shirt.  For a bottom, you are wearing a pair of blue corduroy jeans over a pair of cotton briefs.  You have on some black leather boots.  You are also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a small cloth sack, a portable point unit, an alliance information assistant, a flight control scanner, a backpack, a leather briefcase, a metafrequency FTL transmitter, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, an asteroid hauling supply kit, and a standard starship flightbag.

12:23:39 I don't understand that.

12:23:42 You remove a title of ownership from a small cloth sack.

12:23:50 You'll need to remove a small cloth sack first.

12:23:53 You remove a small cloth sack.

12:23:56 You drop a small cloth sack.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:34:13 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

12:34:15 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:34:23 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:34:26 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

12:34:31 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

12:34:36 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of frozen hydrogen.

12:40:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:40:59 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

12:41:03 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

12:41:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

12:41:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:41:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:41:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:47:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:47:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:47:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

12:47:07 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

12:47:07 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.
The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:47:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:47:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:47:11 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: ){6^UZBlx#Nk{w_pbW;?.=hwfZt`pD?T$=T>33~z
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."

12:47:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:47:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:47:15 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:47:16 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

12:47:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:47:19 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:47:20 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:47:21 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:47:21 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

12:58:53 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:58:53 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:58:54 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:58:55 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:59:26 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

13:01:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

13:01:36 --------------------------

13:01:36 Charge Readout:
--------------------------
5 hours, 42 minutes, and 45 seconds of charge remaining.
This is sufficient for approximately 68 wormhole jumps.

CHARGE LEVEL: 95%
--------------------------

13:01:39 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:01:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Flounder, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:01:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:01:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in The Belt of Orion.

13:01:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:02:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:02:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:02:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:02:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:03:56 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

13:04:01 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of frozen hydrogen.

13:04:02 You're already there.

13:04:05 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

13:04:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:04:44 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

13:04:49 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

13:04:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:05:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:05:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:05:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:05:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Flounder.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:05:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:05:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:14:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:14:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:14:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:14:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:14:33 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

13:14:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Flounder, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

13:14:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:14:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:14:50 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:14:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:14:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:15:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:17:53 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

13:18:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:18:01 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So how are things with Kim and Kim with things?"

13:18:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Night pilots. Fly safe."

13:18:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Shule, how are you holding up?"

13:18:06 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:18:08 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good night Evenia."

13:18:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:18:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:18:22 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Night Eve."

13:18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm doing ok."

13:20:00 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:20:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Flounder.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:20:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:20:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:25:36 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

13:25:41 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be some stray nebular matter.

13:26:36 Invalid selection.

13:26:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:26:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:26:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:26:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:27:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:27:48 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

13:27:51 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:27:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Flounder.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:27:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:28:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:28:13 Storage hold contents:

13:28:13 
[1] a detached hull plate
[2] some stray nebular matter
[3] All

Enter the number of the object you would like to transfer.

13:28:17 You hear metallic scraping as the transfer of the cargo begins.

13:28:19 The sounds from the ship's hold cease as the cargo finishes transferring.

13:28:19 You have been credited with 32667.44 AEU credits for your find.

13:28:41 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

13:28:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:29:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:29:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:35:08 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

13:35:32 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

13:35:35 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:35:41 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:35:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:35:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:35:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

13:39:24 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

13:39:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:39:26 Scanning reveals no nearby debris.

13:39:50 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:40:35 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

13:40:40 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

13:40:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:40:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:40:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:40:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:41:32 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

13:41:35 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

13:41:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Flounder.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

13:41:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

13:41:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

13:41:50 Storage hold contents:

[1] a chunk of iron
[2] a defunct sector probe
[3] All

Enter the number of the object you would like to transfer.

13:41:55 You hear metallic scraping as the transfer of the cargo begins.

13:42:06 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:42:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:46:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:46:32 I don't understand that.

13:46:35 I don't understand that.

13:46:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:46:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

13:46:41 [Starship "Kalliste"; Engineering Room]

13:46:41 You can go north and down.

13:46:42 General Starship status:

Storage capacity: 100% of standard

13:46:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:46:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:46:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:46:52 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

13:46:57 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

13:47:00 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:47:01 The thrumming of the engines slowly changes pitch as the starship moves.

13:47:05 You hear the ping of micrometeorites against the hull of the starship as it moves.

13:47:09 The deck vibrates under you slightly as the ship moves.

13:47:13 You hear a faint whirring as the reactionless drive reorients itself to keep the ship on course.

13:47:17 The starship's hull creaks slightly as it moves.

13:47:21 You hear the ping of micrometeorites against the hull of the starship as it moves.

13:47:25 The ship's artificial gravity fluctuates slightly as it moves.

13:47:29 The deck vibrates under you slightly as the ship moves.

13:47:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:47:58 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

13:48:03 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

13:48:08 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a defunct sector probe.

14:28:20 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

14:28:22 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of industrial slag.

14:28:22 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:28:31 I don't understand that.

14:29:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:29:24 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

14:29:29 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

14:29:34 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a detached sensor component.

14:30:35 Sorry, but no help is available on `starting out'.

Help on: Starting-out
---------------------
This help file is intended to provide you with a quick start into Star Conquest.

	Talking:
To talk, you may use "say," a single quote, or a double quote.
Examples:
say Hello.
'Hello.
"Hello.

	Looking:
The command LOOK gives you basic information about any room, object, or player.  LOOK by itself shows you the room you're in, or you can LOOK <object> to look at something specific.

	Travel:
As in most games of this sort, travel is accomplished by typing any cardinal direction (north, southwest, etc.) or an abbreviation (n, sw, etc.).  "Up", "down", "enter", and "out" are also directions you'll see used.  You can see all valid directions at any time by LOOKing.  You may also notice references to doors, gates, or buildings which have no associated direction; in this case, you may GO DOOR or GO GATE or GO <business name> in order to travel.

	Social Commands:
Numerous social commands are available.  See HELP COMMANDS for a list.

	Important commands:
ASSIST puts in a request for help from a host.
CANCEL cancels an assist.
USERS or WHO shows a list of connected players and on-duty hosts.
CASH or CREDITS gives you a summary of all your currency, and a total amount.

        Policies:
Star Conquest has several important policies which are necessary to maintain game continuity and to make the game fair and balanced for every player.  You may view these at any time by typing POLICY.  All players are expected to know the policies, and we've done our best to make them clearly understandable; ignorance is not a valid excuse.

	Starting out:
You'll want to get in space, as it's really the only means of making money at first, and is the only method of transportation to most other areas.  If you find someone looking for a crew, you may consider joining.  Otherwise, you can purchase a ship of your own.  Capital planets (see HELP ALLIANCES) as well as some other large spaceports have ship stores.  Find one, and look at the ships there.  "The Complete Guide to Modern Starships," available in book stores (see below), provides an overview of all the ships.  You may wish to read it first.  Keep in mind you can only take out 2000000 credits for a ship loan.  Though you can buy only a flitter or cargo hauler at first, you should decide which model you wish to work towards next.  Once you have decided on a model, find an ATM, USE it, and apply for the appropriate amount.  You may then purchase your ship.

	Ship information:
-Put your ship's key on your keychain, and the ship will unlock and lock automatically when you board it.
-Additionally, you may LOCK or UNLOCK your ship key to lock or unlock your ship.  This is only necessary when entering your ship, and not when leaving.
-Never leave your ship floating in space, locked or not.  It can, and almost surely will, be stolen or destroyed.
-Also, always lock your ship when it's docked or landed.  Again, someone is likely to find it if it's unlocked and steal or destroy it.
-There are no help files about flying your ship.  Instead, help in this area is provided in the form of books.  Each capital planet (one of which is the planet you start on) has a bookstore that sells these.  One of your first acts should be to find this bookstore.

	Books:
Bookstores are located in main areas on every capital planet of each alliance.  (See HELP ALLIANCES for more information.) Once you have ordered books you want, refer to the books by the last word in their title: starships for the "Complete Guide to Modern Startships", navigation for "The Layman's Guide to Modern Starship Navigation," etc.
OPEN <book> to open it.
READ <book> to see the current page.
TURN <book> TO <page #> to change pages.

	Communicators:
The best way to get help is from more experienced players.  Star Conquest has several systems designed to help you communicate with the other players.  The most commonly-used form is the metachannel FTL communicator, which provides public channels for your alliance, as well as a general channel for everyone.  Most players keep these communicators on continually; thus they are the best method of contacting anyone.  See HELP COMMUNICATORS for more information.

	Message Boards:
The message board net is a game-wide message system available to every player.  
14:30:39 In addition, announcements from the staff and other important information is often posted there.  Thus, it's a good idea to purchase a message board reader, available at any communications store.

        Additional Problems?
You may run into some problems whose solution eludes you.  You're not the only one.  The average newbie wakes up on his or her second day and finds that the ship is out of power.  If you're having such problems, you may find the solution in HELP TROUBLESHOOTING.

14:30:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:30:57 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

14:31:02 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

14:31:07 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a drifting cloud of tritium.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

14:36:47 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

14:36:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

14:37:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:37:20 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

14:37:25 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

14:37:30 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an asteroid containing rock-eating microbes.

14:40:00 I don't understand that.

14:40:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

14:40:10 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

14:40:15 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

14:40:20 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

14:40:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:40:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:40:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:53:16 You put the ship on red status.

14:53:16 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.

14:53:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

14:59:09 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

14:59:09 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:01:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:06:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:06:47 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

15:06:48 I don't understand that.

15:06:52 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

15:06:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

15:07:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:07:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:07:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:07:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalliste.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

15:07:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

15:07:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

15:07:34 I don't understand that.

15:07:36 Storage hold contents:

Overview of the Functions of a Control Room

The control room is the nerve center of every starship.  It must be manned for any remotely complex operation.  It is the most frequently-used room, and it has the greatest number of commands, as well as the most complex.

To quote from the previous volume in this series, the control room handles such mundane tasks as:

 - Intrasector travel using the reactionless drive.
 - Travel between sectors using the FTL/wormhole drive.
 - Landing on planets, or docking with space stations.
 - Docking with or communicating with other starships in space.
 - Scanning other starships or for specific items of interest in space.
 - Managing transfer or expulsion of cargo and/or debris.
 - Maneuvering against enemy starships in combat and avoiding incoming weapons fire.
 - Shipwide alert status.
 - Coordination.
 - Salvaging.

Three-Dimensional Iconic Sector Representation System

This system is much more commonly known as, simply, the starmap.  Starmaps are standard equipment in every control room, as well as every weapon room and engineering.  The symbols they utilize are universal across all classes and alliances.  Here is an example of a starmap:

Sector 18: Centauri (League) [Human Interalliance Space]

 --------------------
|                    |
|                    |         ---------------
|                    |        |               |
|      #             |        |               |
|              O     |        |               |
|     *              |        |    O*      #  |
|           *        |X-axis  |   #      #    |Z-axis
|    O               |  |     |               |
|           O        |  v     |      *        |
|                    |        |        O    * |
|       #            |        |       O       |
|                    |        |               |
|            #       |         ---------------
|              *     |            X-axis ->
|                    |
 --------------------
       Y-axis

The first line contains the sector catalog number, its common name, and its current controller, as well the general area of space that it occupies.  Everything else, inside the rectangles, is the starmap itself.  The icon key is as follows:

     O -- Planet
     o -- Moon
     # -- Large Space-Based Structure
     * -- Star
     ~ -- Debris
     % -- Asteroid
     $ -- Interdictor
     + -- Docking Module
     ] -- Guard Wasp Deployer
     = -- Jumpgate
     / -- Blockade
     " -- Alien Artifact
     : -- Space Mine
     7 -- Autoturret
     ` -- Combat Wasp
     X -- Your Starship

Any other symbols appearing on a starmap will represent other starships or temporary space structures.

The area key is as follows:

     Human Interalliance Space    -- Space colonized and claimed by the four Human factions.
     Yura Oh Jinu                 -- Translates as Space Of Jinu. Sectors owned by the friendly Jinu species.
     Outsider Space               -- Space owned by the aggressive alien species known as Outsiders.
     Known Space                  -- An area equal to 300 square lightyears encompassing Human and Jinu space.
     Local Space                  -- An area equal to 1000 square lightyears encompassing Known Space.

All sectors are defined as a specific volume of space with the dimensions of 15x20x10 'units'. The X axis (vertically on the large rectangle and horizontally on the small rectangle) is 15 units, the Y axis (horizontally on the large rectangle) is 20 units, and the Z axis (vertically on the small rectangle) is 10 units.

The easiest way to visualize a sector is to imagine that the large rectangle is looking down on the sector from above, a birds-eye view if you will. The s
15:10:14 mall rectangle is looking at the sector from a side profile view.

15:12:57 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

15:12:58 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go south, up, and out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:30:45 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

15:30:46 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:30:50 I don't understand that.

15:31:20 There is 1 player connected:

15:32:21 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

15:32:21 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

15:32:23 There appear to be about 9 pilots recently active.

15:57:28 I don't understand that.

15:57:28 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:57:31 Paddle what?

15:57:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:57:51 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

15:57:57 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

Exploring The Dark Reaches Of The Galactic Void

     So you want to be a Galactic explorer.  Well, a good way to start is to get into space, take a good long look at your starmap, then switch to manual control and fly off the edge.
     However, you'll quickly find that you have no idea where you are or where you're going.  You'll also find that, for the most part, one sector of uncharted space is pretty much like any other.  Even a densely-packed star cluster is mostly void.  There is a huge volume of space out there and no landmarks to guide you.
     This is where the Galactic coordinate system comes in handy.  Much as every object has its own in-sector coordinates, each sector has its own set of coordinates in the Galaxy.  The Galactic Plane lies on a standard X-Y plane, and the Z-axis determines distance above or below the Plane.  From all of Known Space, Coreward is Galactic East, Rimward is Galactic West, spinward is Galactic North, and antispinward is Galactic South.  These directions provide a useful reference when recording important coordinates.
     With the advent of FTL travel, distance is not important -- almost!  You see, location is still extremely important, and with distance, location becomes difficult to judge.  This is why, as you move away from Known Space, you will gradually lose touch with the FTL beacons that have come to indicate the 
16:03:59 presence of Galactic civilization.  First, you will be out of range of the standard beacons that allow travel to specific sectors, and will be able to do only a rough triangulation on Known Space.  Second, at a larger distance, you will lose touch with communications beacons and become isolated.  And finally, at a very large distance, you will lose touch with long-range FTL beacons (which the Jinu call "munroujuhk"), and will not be able to open a wormhole back.
     Distance is also important because, once you are unable to jump, the range determined by your ship's batteries becomes important.  Though the range that can be squeezed out of even a flitter can be surprisingly large with proper planning, you will need to find or establish refueling stations to travel any significantly long distances.
     We hope that this introduction to Galactic navigation has been enjoyable and informative.  If you wish to find out more about what exactly is out there, you can read HELP REWARDS.  However, the best way to learn navigation is to venture outside mapped space and find your way around.

Advanced Ownership Options

     As you become rich and powerful, you may begin to contemplate galactic domination.  There are several advanced ownership options to help you achieve this.  Each such purchase or activity must be approved by the hosts and by your alliance.

     - House: Pilots are entitled to their own custom-built private residence on any colonized planet upon reaching the 1500 point level.  The standard range of cost is at least 1 billion credits, depending, of course, on what you ask to be constructed.  Go to Paradise Homes on New Earth to begin the construction process.

     - Business: You may choose to operate a business on a volunteer basis.  This will have varying startup costs.  Depending on what sort of business it is, it may be housed in a building or a space station.  There is no points requirement for this.  If you are interested in starting a business, write a letter to Agnes Croquette detailing exactly what kind of business you want to start. Startup costs generally begin in the billion range.

     - Permanent Space Station: A privately-owned space station may be purchased at the 30000 point level for 50 billion EAOS credits.

     - Planetary Colony: A privately-owned planetary colony may be purchased at the 50000 point level for 200 billion EAOS credits.

     Space stations and planetary colonies will remain unarmed.  Otherw
16:06:08 ise, the design will be left entirely to the owner(s), within reason.  The prices listed are for basic options only, and the price will increase dramatically depending upon which facilities are included.

16:07:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:07:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:07:16 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

16:07:16 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

16:24:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:24:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:24:07 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

16:24:07 You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:24:08 You exit the ship.

16:24:14 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:24:14 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:24:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:24:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:24:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

16:24:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:24:28 The ship is already moving.

16:24:31 The ship is already moving.

16:24:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:24:32 Which sector did you mean?

16:24:32 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

16:24:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:24:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:24:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

16:24:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:24:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:24:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:24:41 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:24:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

16:24:46 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:24:53 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

16:24:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:25:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:25:16 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

16:25:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

16:25:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

16:25:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

16:25:37 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

16:25:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:25:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

16:25:50 You softly rub Lileah Rose.

16:25:58 I don't understand that.

16:26:09 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

17:13:14 You're already there.

17:13:16 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

17:13:21 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

17:13:27 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

17:13:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:13:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:13:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

17:13:51 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

17:13:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:14:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:14:05 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

17:14:12 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

17:14:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalliste.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:14:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:14:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:14:32 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

17:14:32 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go south, up, and out.

17:50:24 Around you, Soviet Trail slowly begins its transition from the quiet residences of Canada Street to the industry of the area to the north.

17:55:56 ---------------------
Help on: Starting-out
---------------------
This help file is intended to provide you with a quick start into Star Conquest.

	Talking:
To talk, you may use "say," a single quote, or a double quote.
Examples:
say Hello.
'Hello.
"Hello.

	Looking:
The command LOOK gives you basic information about any room, object, or player.  LOOK by itself shows you the room you're in, or you can LOOK <object> to look at something specific.

	Travel:
As in most games of this sort, travel is accomplished by typing any cardinal direction (north, southwest, etc.) or an abbreviation (n, sw, etc.).  "Up", "down", "enter", and "out" are also directions you'll see used.  You can see all valid directions at any time by LOOKing.  You may also notice references to doors, gates, or buildings which have no associated direction; in this case, you may GO DOOR or GO GATE or GO <business name> in order to travel.

	Social Commands:
Numerous social commands are available.  See HELP COMMANDS for a list.

	Important commands:
ASSIST puts in a request for help from a host.
CANCEL cancels an assist.
USERS or WHO shows a list of connected players and on-duty hosts.
CASH or CREDITS gives you a summary of all your currency, and a total amount.

        Policies:
Star Conquest has several important policies which are necessary to maintain game continuity and to make the game fair and balanced for every player.  You may view these at any time by typing POLICY.  All players are expected to know the policies, and we've done our best to make them clearly understandable; ignorance is not a valid excuse.

	Starting out:
You'll want to get in space, as it's really the only means of making money at first, and is the only method of transportation to most other areas.  If you find someone looking for a crew, you may consider joining.  Otherwise, you can purchase a ship of your own.  Capital planets (see HELP ALLIANCES) as well as some other large spaceports have ship stores.  Find one, and look at the ships there.  "The Complete Guide to Modern Starships," available in book stores (see below), provides an overview of all the ships.  You may wish to read it first.  Keep in mind you can only take out 2000000 credits for a ship loan.  Though you can buy only a flitter or cargo hauler at first, you should decide which model you wish to work towards next.  Once you have decided on a model, find an ATM, USE it, and apply for the appropriate amount.  You may then purchase your ship.

	Ship information:
-Put your ship's key on your keychain, and the ship will unlock and lock automatically when you board it.
-Additionally, you may LOCK or UNLOCK your ship key to lock or unlock your ship.  This is only necessary when entering your ship, and not when leaving.
-Never leave your ship floating in space, locked or not.  It can, and almost surely will, be stolen or destroyed.
-Also, always lock your ship when it's docked or landed.  Again, someone is likely to find it if it's unlocked and steal or destroy it.
-There are no help files about flying your ship.  Instead, help in this area is provided in the form of books.  Each capital planet (one of which is the planet you start on) has a bookstore that sells these.  One of your first acts should be to find this bookstore.

	Books:
Bookstores are located in main areas on every capital planet of each alliance.  (See HELP ALLIANCES for more information.) Once you have ordered books you want, refer to the books by the last word in their title: starships for the "Complete Guide to Modern Startships", navigation for "The Layman's Guide to Modern Starship Navigation," etc.
OPEN <book> to open it.
READ <book> to see the current page.
TURN <book> TO <page #> to change pages.

	Communicators:
The best way to get help is from more experienced players.  Star Conquest has several systems designed to help you communicate with the other players.  The most commonly-used form is the metachannel FTL communicator, which provides public channels for your alliance, as well as a general channel for everyone.  Most players keep these communicators on continually; thus they are the best method of contacting anyone.  See HELP COMMUNICATORS for more information.

	Message Boards:
The message board net is a game-wide message system available to every player.  
17:55:56 In addition, announcements from the staff and other important information is often posted there.  Thus, it's a good idea to purchase a message board reader, available at any communications store.

        Additional Problems?
You may run into some problems whose solution eludes you.  You're not the only one.  The average newbie wakes up on his or her second day and finds that the ship is out of power.  If you're having such problems, you may find the solution in HELP TROUBLESHOOTING.

17:56:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did somebody say breakfast? I'm down for breakfast, I'm at colt's right now."

17:56:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

17:56:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, hey Akira."

17:56:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've seen you in conquest results but never on comms."

17:57:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah yes. Greetings Akira."

17:57:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello Akira."

17:57:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Akira Kazama transmits, "Ah, hi."

17:57:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hiya Akira."

17:58:23 Not much to see out there.

17:58:25 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:58:26 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:58:26 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:58:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:58:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:58:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:58:46 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:58:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:58:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

17:58:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:58:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:58:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:58:54 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:58:54 You remove a copy of "A Pilot's Guide To Shopping in the Sixty" from a leather briefcase.

17:58:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

17:58:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:58:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:58:58 You open a copy of "A Pilot's Guide To Shopping in the Sixty".

17:58:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:58:59 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:59:01 You turn to page 2.

17:59:01 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

17:59:04 The ship's engines are not able to be activated while not in flight.  You must launch first.

17:59:05 Your ship will travel much more efficiently once off the ground.

17:59:37 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:59:37 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

17:59:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

17:59:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

17:59:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We're hanging out in the lounge, Shule."

17:59:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

17:59:57 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:59:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh here you are."

18:00:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Should I come over? Or are you guys just meeting to go on another beacon?"

18:00:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We are meeting to go on a beacon, but yes, you should come also."

18:00:43 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:00:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:00:43 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

18:00:43 You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:00:44 You exit the ship.

18:00:44 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

18:00:46 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

18:00:46 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Constantine Stone and Tara Flores are sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.

18:00:48 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:00:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want to."

18:00:50 You wave.

18:00:51 Constantine Stone waves.

18:00:54 Tara Flores waves to you.

18:00:57 Tara says to you, "Hello!"

18:01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I probably shouldn't do a beacon right now."

18:01:06 You hug Tara Flores.

18:01:12 Tara Flores hugs you.

18:01:14 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:01:20 You exclaim, "Hi!"

18:01:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ugh. Remind me to find something better to sleep on than the floor."

18:01:42 Constantine Stone keys his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:01:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:01:44 Tara Flores keys her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:01:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

18:01:49 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You woke up just in time to do a beacon with us."

18:01:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles. "Been there done that."

18:02:03 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:02:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thank the uncomfortable floor for that."

18:02:24 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

18:02:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Did I? I'm hoping there's a gun for me, because the idea of engineering puts my blood to ice."

18:02:37 Tara Flores speaks into her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, you should join us on a beacon drop, Dakhal."

18:02:45 Constantine Stone asks, "Think we can use a gunship?"

18:02:48 You say, "I can engineer."

18:02:50 You say, "Sure."

18:02:56 You say, "We can take my gunship or pulsar."

18:03:13 Tara Flores speaks into her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:03:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "We're hanging out at the pilots lounge right now."

18:03:24 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

18:03:53 You say to Constantine, "Which would you prefer? Gunship or pulsar?"

18:04:00 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, hmm."

18:04:03 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Pulsar!"

18:04:06 You cheer.

18:04:07 Constantine Stone says, "I thought that was a gunship though."

18:04:09 Tara Flores asks, "Pew pew boom?"

18:04:12 You say, "It is."

18:04:16 Constantine Stone says, "Oh okay."

18:04:18 You say, "Pulsar is a tier 2 gunship."

18:04:22 Dakhal Araegin just arrived.

18:04:22 Constantine Stone nods.

18:04:24 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

18:04:24 Constantine Stone waves.

18:04:28 You say, "Gunship is a tier 1 gunship."

18:04:29 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

18:04:30 Dakhal Araegin takes a sip of a cup of Earl Grey tea.

18:04:33 Tara waves towards Dakhal Araegin "Hello!"

18:04:44 You wave to Dakhal Araegin.

18:05:01 Dakhal Araegin says, "Hello, you two."

18:05:04 Dakhal Araegin yawns.

18:05:12 You say, "Let's see if we can't get one more."

18:05:17 Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah."

18:05:17 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey just arrived.

18:05:17 Orby the security hoverbot floats in after Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

18:05:19 Constantine Stone waves.

18:05:22 Constantine Stone cheers for Rogue Pilot Eli Grey!

18:05:24 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

18:05:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

18:05:26 Dakhal Araegin takes a sip of a cup of Earl Grey tea.

18:05:26 You cheer for Rogue Pilot Eli Grey!

18:05:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey waves.

18:05:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

18:05:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

18:05:38 You say to Eli, "You're joining us?"

18:05:40 Tara waves in greeting to Eli "How's it going?"

18:05:41 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the two-person Accord gemini "Amaterasu" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

18:06:05 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Nah, besides it looks like you've already got a fully crewed Pulsar right here."

18:06:13 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Just thought I'd come hang out and say hi."

18:06:20 Dakhal Araegin takes a sip of a cup of Earl Grey tea.

18:06:23 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh wait."

18:06:28 Constantine Stone laughs.

18:06:29 Eli counts on his fingers.

18:06:30 You say, "Nope, we're undercrewed."

18:06:39 Shule counts "1 2 3 5"

18:06:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Ah screw it, I'll engineer?"

18:06:52 Constantine Stone cheers.

18:07:03 You exclaim, "That means I can't be lazy!"

18:07:06 You pout.

18:07:09 Eli rummages around in a dark gray engineering tool case.

18:07:19 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'll only have time for one though."

18:07:19 You say to Eli, "Need tools?"

18:07:24 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

18:07:47 You ask, "Everyone ready?"

18:07:47 Tara says to Dakhal, "Have you done a beacon drop before?"

18:07:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I might need a battle recharge."

18:07:50 Tara Flores stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

18:07:51 Tara Flores nods to you.

18:07:55 You remove a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

18:07:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I"ve only got 37 left."

18:07:59 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey doesn't seem to have a free hand.

18:08:03 Dakhal Araegin nods to Tara Flores.

18:08:06 Dakhal Araegin takes a sip of a cup of Earl Grey tea.

18:08:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey finishes off a hot scrambled egg croissant sandwich with a sizzling sausage patty and pepper jack.

18:09:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah, I have a pulsar."

18:09:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:09:29 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, is it on the torus?"

18:09:32 You nod.

18:09:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ah yes, five person clipper beacon."

18:09:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:09:39 Which sector did you mean?

18:09:40 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)

18:09:41 You laugh.

18:09:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:09:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:09:47 Constantine Stone says, "I thought with this influx of new pilots I might revive the Shule Fighter contest in a week."

18:09:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

18:10:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I violated so many beacon rules yesterday."

18:10:12 You say to Eli, "?yes, 5-person clipper beacons."

18:10:16 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 885" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

18:10:21 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

18:10:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which ones?"

18:10:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:10:22 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

18:10:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

18:10:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:10:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "This is where I hang ot of the airlock with a stun cannon, right?"

18:10:34 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances around at his surroundings.

18:10:35 You chuckle.

18:10:36 Constantine Stone laughs.

18:10:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:10:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:10:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:10:40 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:10:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", a wormhole drive tracer, and Orby the security hoverbot here.
Tara Flores, Dakhal Araegin, Rogue Pilot Eli Grey, and Constantine Stone are standing here.

18:10:54 You see a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Please only use lasers unless otherwise directed. Thank you." and an overstuffed red chair here.
You can go south and down.

18:10:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:11:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:11:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey walks in from below.

18:11:07 Orby the security hoverbot floats in after Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

18:11:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey walks south.

18:11:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I manage chains sort of poorly."

18:11:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh jeez. Did you start at 10 10 10?"

18:11:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Chains just take practie."

18:12:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Akira Kazama transmits, "I need to get back into the swing of things... I'm a little rusty."

18:12:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Never start at 10 10 10."

18:12:15 The starship transitions into another sector.

18:12:44 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Then you're stuck in a little tiny section."

18:12:50 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, can bigger ships get chained more than once?"

18:12:57 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Very much so."

18:13:02 The starship transitions into another sector.

18:13:08 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I've been chained by 3 or more ships before."

18:13:09 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Are the outsiders cruel enough to chain you twice and then just fly in opposite directions?"

18:13:13 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Because that's what I would do."

18:13:16 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If I had chains."

18:34:10 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:34:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

18:34:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to you.

18:34:11 You say to Eli, "Thanks."

18:34:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:34:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:34:15 Constantine Stone says, "Thanks guys."

18:34:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:34:15 You put on a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

18:34:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Critical Strike! Welcome to home space!"

18:34:20 Constantine Stone exclaims, "1062 evasions!"

18:34:21 Constantine Stone presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

18:34:22 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

18:34:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:34:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:34:48 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:34:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Critical Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

18:34:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:34:53 Constantine Stone says, "I might go grab a piece of scrap, if that's okay."

18:34:58 You say, "Go for it."

18:35:01 Constantine Stone says into the PA microphone, "Thanks everybody!"

18:35:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:35:02 You are credited with 2,826,929.05 AEU credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.
You say, "One pile per pilot."

18:35:06 Constantine Stone pulls a large lever towards him.

18:35:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:35:08 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:35:09 Constantine Stone scrambles to his feet.

18:35:09 Constantine Stone walks south.

18:35:11 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Oh yeah, I wanna grab some wormhole stuff."

19:20:17 Some lights on the three-person light merchant ship "Kalliste" suddenly flash several times.

19:20:18 [Starship "Kalliste"; Airlock]
You can go out and into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:20:19 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

19:20:19 You can go south, up, and out.

19:20:20 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:20:20 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:20:20 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:20:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:20:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:20:35 The ship is already moving.

19:20:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:20:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

19:20:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:20:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:20:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:20:52 I don't understand that.

19:20:54 I don't understand that.

19:21:53 There are no other ships in this sector.

19:21:55 I don't understand that.

19:21:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

19:22:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:22:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:22:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:07:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the drills on heavies and reapers can take out turrets pretty quick."

20:07:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Luckily a single torpedo should take them out, so it's okay to lose a few guns."

20:07:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It took two, but it certainly went out with a bang."

20:07:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They are also learning machines, it's quite possible that they've learned what parts of the starships can hurt them."

20:07:54 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well back to regenning damage."

20:07:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have a cargo bay extension on that thing, Tara? You can make them carry even more."

20:08:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Learning might be a strong word, they're adapting machines."

20:08:52 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There was a pilot of the union, who to form a better communion, with a league girl, took her up for a whirl, Are we there yet she asked, said he, I"m in."

20:09:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yup, got a storage extender from Bikura."

20:09:41 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Anyway so class, the thee is what I did on my last vacation. And no reference to recent unpleasantness please."

20:10:05 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Message Beacon at Exploration Waypoint 73573 is now online!

20:10:05 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new AEU Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Message Beacon in Exploration Waypoint 73573.

20:10:24 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok if no one else will speak up."

20:10:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

20:11:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's hard to say what I did on my last vaction, I don't remember large chunks of it."

20:12:48 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "On my last vacation I went on an expedition in to a wild and alien world. The people there spoke a weird lingo and insisted on rising very early. They would eat a massive breakfast. Then they would walk or draw for a while. They would have a small meal near noon, then go out visiting all their friends and acquaintances. If those were not present (because they were visiting their friends and acquaintances) they'd leave a card saying they'd been there. They'd eat a supper of many courses, then dance or go to the theatre, have another light meal, then go to bed."

20:13:06 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Eli, most themes written for a class are fiction, just make it up."

20:13:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um..."

20:13:18 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Um what?"

20:13:39 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh you said theme."

20:13:47 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, you wanted us to write themes."

20:14:09 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Now I decided it's a bad ide."

20:14:16 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Idea."

20:14:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule, I set up the message beacon but can't set the message on it."

20:14:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if you want to come all the way out for that or what. How important is the message?"

20:15:14 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Those people were weird they lit their houses with potentially deadly gases, and burned potentially unhealthy stones for warmth, it was awful."

20:15:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well then on my last summer vaction and wandered out into the Sea of Grass and communed with the black rautines, they were very friendly and showed me how well they could use tools as they politley pecked out my eyes."

20:16:17 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hmm. I think you have delusions of atherhood."

20:16:39 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yet no one will ever even touch that level of insanity."

20:16:55 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Or delusion."

20:19:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't forget folks, annual Avian Sacrifice Day is gonna be here before you know it. Get those stun rifles ready."

20:19:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Two pirates in the belt of orion. League Recon craft."

20:20:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll chase 'em off."

20:21:40 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:21:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:21:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:21:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:21:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:21:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

20:22:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hi, Shule!"
The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:22:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

20:22:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:22:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:22:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:22:17 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:22:17 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

20:22:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:22:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They fled from my tiny fighter."

20:22:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:22:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:22:22 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:22:24 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Critical Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

20:22:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I got my full license, Shule."

20:22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I saw that. Congratulations Tara!"

20:22:48 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

20:22:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:23:02 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 885" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

20:23:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:23:18 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

20:23:21 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 885" has jumped out of the sector.

20:23:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Critical Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:23:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:23:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

20:23:39 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:23:39 *** Timed-out waiting for login. ***

20:23:39 *** Timed-out waiting for login. ***
20:23:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:23:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:23:46 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

20:23:46 You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:23:46 You exit the ship.

20:23:47 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

20:23:47 [The Torus; Garage]

20:23:47 You can go up.

20:23:50 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

20:23:50 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:23:51 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:23:52 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

20:24:16 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:30:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks! I got a scout and firefly to start with."

20:33:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I never thought it would be hard to find some RATS."

20:34:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Try checking the beacons under Dusty Reaches and Spinward Cluster."

20:34:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And Vortex, look there too."

20:34:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Already cleared out Spinward and the Reaches, will check the Vortex."

20:36:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also if you're in those sectors and press the button to jump it will give you a list of locations."

20:37:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Among those will be the child beacons to whatever beacon you're in."

20:37:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ah yes. I cleared the nearby beacons as well."

20:37:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh okay, good."

20:37:16 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "How long will be around today, Luja?"

20:37:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, she's already gone."

20:52:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Want to do that artifacting in my new scout, maybe, Con?"

20:53:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do want to do that, but I don't think I can do that today."

20:53:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm sorry to say."

20:54:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "No, its okay. I still need to build industry points to get the autovector upgrade."

20:54:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah! You must be getting close."

20:54:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hundred and thirtish points away."

20:55:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want to really salvage like a fiend, take the inserter from Mir to 777."

20:55:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im not sure how to operate it."

20:55:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just jump on over to Mir, then punch in travel 777 on your autotravel console."

20:55:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There is a toll, but you'll make it back."

20:55:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Be warned though that the trip can take a while."

20:56:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Is there a processing station in 777?"

20:56:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There is, yeah, and also a recharging station if you need to sleep out there."

20:56:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And a watchtower if you get any pirate or IFS interference."

20:56:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What kind of grapple should I be using before I try salvaging there?"

20:57:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Grade 40 will be good for anything you find, I think."

20:57:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I've got the tier 2 Fine toothed one right now."

20:58:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I can't remember the grade on that one, but it should be good."

20:58:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its thirty."

20:59:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. Well, it might still be worth it."

20:59:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Something to think about, at least."

20:59:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'll check it out, just finishing cleaning up the debris in Orion."

20:59:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I like it out there because it's all shipwrecks."

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:01:23 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Evenia."

21:01:57 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hiya, Eve."

21:10:26 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

21:11:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I tried traveling to 777 and it didn't work."

21:11:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What sector are you in?"

21:11:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Mir."

21:12:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, what does the computer say when you try it."

21:12:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That theres no such sector."

21:12:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Uh oh. One second."

21:15:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I think I broke 777."

21:16:00 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wasn't able to set a message on the beacon, and now no one can travel there."

21:16:04 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are those two things related?"

21:16:18 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Shouldn't be. Did you set headings?"

21:16:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I set headings on the inserters I put in Mir and in 777."

21:16:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I've used both since I did that."

21:17:03 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hmm, I will take a look."

21:20:27 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Okay."

21:21:08 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "The beacon didn't get labeled so for the moment it's 73573. Also, we don't have the toll up."

21:21:24 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, sorry about that. Is labeling separate from setting a message?"

21:21:37 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So we gotta travel to 73573?"

21:21:52 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yep. You shouldn't need to label if you catch the beacon before it falls, but if you replace it after the fact you will need to relabel."

21:22:06 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "And yes, for now. I am going out there to label it."

21:22:09 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. I'll replace it earlier next time."

21:22:12 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks Johann."

21:22:27 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "No problem."

21:22:37 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, my first rift trip on my ownbegins."

21:22:47 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Constantine, if you want to throw the toll up, it's 5000000."

21:23:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

21:23:49 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That was unsettling."

21:23:53 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I can't do that."

21:23:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess trustees only?"

21:24:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How do I check my eta?"

21:24:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a 'rift' button."

21:24:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It will list a bunch of commands for you."

21:24:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Rift status is what you want."

21:24:33 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'll fix it in a minute."

21:25:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thirty two minutes in the rift. Woo. It looked like I was warping into some living creature."

21:25:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, the rift is crazy."

21:25:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That travel time isn't too bad. Hopefully the flow will shift and give you a speedy return when you decide to come back."

21:26:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've gone on trips out there and had it take over an hour each way."

21:26:36 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Done."

21:26:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm going to need to get a payout before I return if they're making the toll five million, heh. I spent a lot of money upgrading my scout and firefly."

21:26:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well the return trip has no toll."

21:27:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So basically you got a free ride out of my incompetence."

21:27:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

21:28:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Remember, flee to an adjacent sector or go to the watch tower if there are any enemies. And 776 to get back."

21:29:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The speed of the rist is absoutly insane.."

21:29:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rift, even."

21:31:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Glad I brought my coffee dispenser."

21:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:45:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "|ow, I must b{ far out."

22:03:25 You can't go that way.

22:03:27 [Starship "Landon Boucher"; Control Room]

22:03:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:03:30 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:03:30 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:03:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:03:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:03:34 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:03:38 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Landon Boucher, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:03:39 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:03:48 The ship is already moving.

22:03:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:03:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:03:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:03:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

22:03:53 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:03:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:03:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:03:57 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:03:57 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Endymion Orbit."

22:04:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Landon Boucher. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

22:04:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:04:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:04:24 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:10:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:10:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:10:35 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:14:06 [Starship "Landon Boucher"; Control Room]

22:14:06 You can go south, up, and out.

22:14:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:14:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Landon Boucher, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:14:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:14:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:14:27 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Capital Ship Drydock. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:14:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:14:28 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

22:14:31 You sit down.

22:14:31 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:14:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:14:34 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:14:35 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:14:35 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Shipyards."

22:14:36 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:14:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:14:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:14:40 The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and darkened, and the ISC is no more.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:14:40 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Capital Ship Drydock."

22:14:41 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:14:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:14:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:14:45 A large frame hangs in space here, sufficiently large to at least contain a battlecruiser-class starship.

22:26:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:26:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:26:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:26:13 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

22:26:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That warship must not be in range of the lasers, and I think it knows that. Its sitting far away."

22:26:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:26:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:26:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

22:26:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:27:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:27:03 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:27:04 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:27:48 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]

22:27:48 Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

22:31:44 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:31:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

22:31:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:31:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:32:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:32:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:32:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:32:07 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:32:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:32:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:32:29 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:32:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:32:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:32:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:32:50 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:32:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm suprised they haven't jumped out, yet."

22:33:46 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:33:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

22:53:48 Evenia an Eachtrannach
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth. Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her waist-length, curly hair is ebony with metallic silver streaks and in loose ringlets drawn up into carefree cluster of curls at the top of her head, with long tendrils framing her face. She has long painted shimmering ice blue fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces her right upper ear, a small enameled golden yellow dragon pierces her right earlobe, and a small enameled golden yellow dragon pierces her left earlobe.
 She is wearing an exquisite floral choker of sapphires and emeralds, a black leather jacket with numerous zippers and snaps, a pair of thick black leather wrist bands with two rows of half-inch-long darkly gleaming steel cone studs, a gold link c
22:53:48 hain with a onyx dagger suspended from it around her waist, a pair of very short black and deep blue sequined shorts with a v-front, and a pair of sleek black vinyl boots with numerous silver zippers. She is also wearing an eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass dolphin, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, a gold link bracelet with a lapis lazuli dagger suspended from it, a stamp of a blue dragonfly superimposed over the planet Hyperion, and a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster. Her head, face, both eyes, both hands, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying an old big violet soldier felo in her right hand, and an old normal violet soldier felo in her left hand.

22:53:51 Evenia an Eachtrannach says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

22:54:00 You say, "What."

22:54:02 You are currently wearing portions of a spacesuit. Do you wish to unsuit now?

22:54:02 [Enter `yes' or `no']

22:57:39 Evenia an Eachtrannach hugs you.

22:58:11 The ship's current engine speed is 4800 km/s.

22:58:11 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 7.5 seconds.

22:58:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:58:19 Would you like to land at this bari pod?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

22:58:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a bari pod.

22:59:00 [Starship "Bari Fighter"; Control Room]

22:59:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Bari Pod; Organic Valve.
You see a bari hive, a small horde of larval bari, an old big violet soldier felo, and an old normal violet soldier felo here.

Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

23:06:34 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "You are not having a good day today."

23:06:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:06:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:06:43 You chuckle.

23:06:44 You say, "Nope."

23:06:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:44:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:44:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:44:20 You peer out...

23:44:21 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The one-person fighter "The Claw" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:44:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:44:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:44:32 [Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Checking Dustry Reaches through Accord now."

23:44:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:44:36 [General Communication] Atticus Bridger transmits, "I just woke up a little while ago. Whats even going on?"

23:44:42 Which sector did you mean?

23:44:42 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

23:44:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "777 is clear too."

23:44:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:44:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:44:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:44:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:44:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:44:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:44:51 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:44:52 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:44:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:44:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:44:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:44:56 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:44:59 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:45:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:45:28 The starship is already moving.

23:45:28 The starship is already moving.

23:45:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:45:48 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:45:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:45:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:46:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:46:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:46:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:46:14 You scramble to your feet.

23:46:14 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:46:15 You exit the ship.

23:46:15 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

23:46:17 [The Torus; Garage]

23:46:17 You can go up.

23:46:20 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Airlock]

23:46:20 You see a glossy blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a felo nest, and an obese red soldier felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:46:21 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]

23:46:22 You see a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow bowl, Mekensie the humanoid service robot, a hefty red soldier felo, and a large red soldier felo kitten here.
You can go south and out.

23:46:24 You put down an obese light red soldier felo.

23:46:25 You put down a large steel soldier felo.

23:46:28 An obese light red soldier felo rubs up against a hefty red soldier felo, and both animals purr softly.

23:46:30 You say, "Mekensie contents."

23:46:31 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Caretaking task has been canceled."

23:46:31 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "I am currently holding a container of fish food, a hull brush, a tube of Rust-B-Gone, a tube of weapon grease, and a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow"."

23:46:39 You remove a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow" from a leather briefcase.

23:46:40 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:46:44 You give a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow" to Mekensie the humanoid service robot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

23:46:46 I see no "family" here.

23:46:56 You say, "Mekensie caretake."

23:46:57 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order confirmed."

23:46:58 Mekensie the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "I shall watch over the living beings on this ship as if they were my own."

23:47:05 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Airlock]

23:47:05 You see a glossy blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a felo nest, and an obese red soldier felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:47:06 You exit the ship.

23:47:06 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

23:47:08 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]

23:47:08 You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

23:47:13 Board what?

23:47:17 [The Torus; Garage]

23:47:17 You can go up.

23:47:20 Board what?

23:47:24 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

23:47:24 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:47:25 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:47:25 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:47:26 There appear to be about 22 pilots recently active.

23:58:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:58:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:58:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:58:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:58:39 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:58:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:58:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:58:53 The ship is already moving.

23:58:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:58:56 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

23:59:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:59:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:59:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
