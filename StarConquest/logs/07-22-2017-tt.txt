Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings.
Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down.
Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface
at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a
bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air
intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks
loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is
in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator,
and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator,
and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec is sitting on Shule Elemmire's
lap.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
This grassy chunk of land inexplicably hovers above the surface of the world
below, like a floating island traveling through the clouds. Over the edge, you
can see peaceful towns connected by narrow stone roads and farmlands that
checker the world below. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white

[Nouveau Quebec; Independence Plaza]
Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this
spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec. The straight
sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the
blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging
mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In
the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant
fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal
statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the
north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller,
somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au
Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique
des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window,
where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'

them a clothing shop named 'L'Aubainerie,' a store selling artistic home decor
called 'La Belle au Nouveau Quebec,' another called 'Le Toucher Velours,' where
coats are displayed in a lighted shop window, and yet a fourth shop with a sign
next to it reading: 'Petite Mais Doux.' A cozy inn is also here, a sign out

Subject: Temporary Scooping Station - Olivia's Pearl
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 20:59 22 July 2317 GST
--
Hello everyone,
I will start posting Temporary Stations Parts lists for the Temporary Space
Stations which we either maintain or rotate to maintain.
The first Temporary Station is our Scooping Station in Olivia's Pearl. We are
very close to that next level of Scoop which is the Advanced Passive Hydrogen
Scoop . however it requires 1000 Command and we're not quite there. I'm certain
that we will achieve this goal by the time the next Scooping station goes
offline.
The Scoop is a valuable resource to SEAS as it typically yields 8 or more
Command plus the current improved Scoop yields 3 Megacredits per day. So after
16 days, we earn 48 Megacredits and at least 8 Command. The cost of modules to
build the Scooping station is currently 13 Megacredits and the next one,
depending upon which ejecter is purchased, will cost up to 16 Megacredits. I
have been using the Storage Container Unmanned Pickup which does not deliver
Command or Megacredits until the station goes offline I think. It's hard to
determine this as Command seems to accrue when you least expect it as we have a
number of sources of Command and Megacredit income.
At 1000 Command, we will be eligible to obtain the Storage Container Daily
Pickup which yields daily pickup of the Storage Module so instead of receiving
our Command and Megacredits in one sum at the demise of the station, we would
receive 4 Megacredits per day or depending upon the level of the Scoop, more
than 4 Megacredits per day and some portion of a command point. Since we have a
fairly good balance of Megacredits, there really is no current need to spend 3
Megacredits on the Daily pickup ejecter versus the Unmanned pickup but if you
all prefer different, then we can go for the Daily pickup.
The Scooping station is solar powered and is placed in Olivia's Pearl. It
typically has a life span of approximately 16 days so once a Scooping station is
up, we would want to check the Range office in a couple of weeks to ascertain
when it will be going offline.
I typically build the Scooping and the majority of Temporary Space Stations in
the Constructor which belongs to me. I will likely obtain one for SEAS at some
point within six months and will be obtaining some extra modules as well.
The parts list for the Scooping station in Olivia's Peral is as follows --
Top - Basic Control Center (cost is 1 Megacredit)
Core - Core (cost is 1 Megacredit)
Scoop- Improved Passive Hydrogen Scoop (cost is 4 Megacredits)
Ejecter - Storage Container Unmanned Pickup (cost is 1 Megacredit)
Power Plant - Solar Panel Array (cost is 6 Megacredits)
Note - the Solar Panel Array costs 6 Megacredits versus a Large precharged
Battery which costs 8 Megacredits.
Special Notes - we can't replace the current Scooping station until the current
one goes offline as only one Scoop per organization is allowed to be in
operation at one time.
concerning how to construct this particular Temporary Space Station or anything
concerning construction of Temporary Space Stations in general, please seekout
either myself or Shule.
