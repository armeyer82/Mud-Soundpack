Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:42:16 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:42:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:42:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:42:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:42:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:42:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:42:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:42:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides east.

01:42:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:42:38 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:57:03 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:57:03 You say, "Well, it was a rental ship though. So, they're not the worst lasers."

01:57:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:57:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:57:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:57:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah but they don't have our bonus."

01:57:22 You say, "True."

01:57:23 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:07:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:07:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.

02:34:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I decorated the conference room with some balloons and a stuffed rautine."

02:34:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I truly believe if we went head to head, we'd kick their butts."

02:34:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nice!"

02:34:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:34:53 "You want to sit down?" You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:34:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:41:26 You grin.

02:41:32 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:41:33 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

02:42:14 I don't understand that.

02:42:17 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:42:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm going to get a platter and get sandwiches from Mickey's on Hyperion."

02:45:35 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:46:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:47:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Constantine? Just a head's up but, there's a certain siege master in our lounge."

02:47:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh nice!"

02:47:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey, I'm building you a massive party in the conference room."

02:50:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is it alright if katina joins us?"

02:50:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on your lap.

02:50:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course!"

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:01:09 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:01:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at you thoughtfully.

03:01:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts an elegant crystal decanter in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:02:17 You stand up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:02:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident falls from your lap.

03:02:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh this is embarrassing."

03:02:41 You ask, "Oh, sorry. Should we head over to New Earth?"

03:02:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes."

03:02:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:02:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:02:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:03:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

03:03:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:03:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:03:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:03:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:03:31 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:03:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:03:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:03:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:03:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:03:38 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:03:39 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:03:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:03:41 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

03:03:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:03:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:03:43 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:03:46 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

03:03:46 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

03:04:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:04:06 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:04:09 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:04:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:04:44 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:04:49 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

03:04:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:04:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident holds your hand, taking you into her group.

03:04:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:05:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

03:05:04 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:05:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

03:05:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:05:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls you towards her.

03:05:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:05:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:06:03 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:43:54 Johnathon Triggs nods.

03:44:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But you know there are various people around just talk to them."

03:44:39 Johnathon says to Lily, "I think I might know where to find it... But, may have to improve my reputation in the Alliance a bit more.. like... not being a cadet."

03:44:41 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

03:45:00 Jacob continues to play the concerto and smiles broadly as he nears the cadenza.

03:48:44 Johnathon Triggs nods.

03:48:53 Constantine Stone takes a bite of a slice of cake.

03:48:55 Jacob Shields says, "And this piano simply does not do bach justice."

03:49:34 Lily says to Eli, "To places across points where we can no longer travel to."

03:49:35 Constantine Stone waves to Evenia Callseah.

03:49:36 Jacob says to Constantine, "Oh it sounds well enough, but it was never meant to be played on the piano."

03:49:42 Constantine Stone nods to Jacob Shields.

03:49:48 Rahab Cassidy waves to Constantine Stone.

03:50:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves and smiles at Rahab Cassidy.

03:50:53 Jacob says to Tanny, "So do I, honestly. But I figure, I need to practice those peaces if I want to perform them for others at some point."

03:50:57 Rahab Cassidy says, "What should be fix? I just missed the last explanation I bet."

03:51:04 Rahab Cassidy smiles and waves to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:51:08 Constantine says to Johnathon, "It definitely is. I wanted to have a meeting about that and some other things when the strike ended, but that's really nowhere in sight."

03:51:15 Constantine says to Johnathon, "So maybe we can just have one in the new term."

03:51:16 Tanny Hill nods to Jacob Shields.

03:51:22 Jacob Shields smiles at Rahab Cassidy.

03:51:27 Johnathon says to Rahab, "Our ability to go through the Skim."

12:36:11 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:36:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:36:31 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:36:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

12:36:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:36:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:36:46 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:36:46 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:36:48 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

12:36:48 You can go out and enter into the ship.

12:36:48 You exit the ship.
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

12:36:49 [Chetumal Spaceport; Garage]

12:36:49 You can go up and down.

12:36:52 The two-person light transport "Effervescent Zephyr" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved to the launching area.

12:36:54 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]

12:36:54 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" and the two-person light transport "Effervescent Zephyr" are landed here.

You can go southwest.

12:36:55 Which ship would you like to service?

12:36:55 
[1] Deadly Strike (AEU)
[2] Effervescent Zephyr (Fringe)

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:36:58 There is not enough felo chow aboard. Would you like to buy a sufficient supply for 1,020,000.00 Fringe credits?

12:36:58 [Enter `yes' or `no']

12:36:59 Felo chow has been distributed and all troughs have been filled!

12:36:59 You order a felo feeding.

12:37:01 [Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]

12:37:01 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" and the two-person light transport "Effervescent Zephyr" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

12:37:06 The two-person light transport "Effervescent Zephyr" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

12:37:13 I don't understand that.

12:37:16 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

12:37:16 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:37:18 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:37:18 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

12:37:18 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

12:37:19 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

12:37:20 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:37:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:37:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:37:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

12:37:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:37:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:37:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:37:39 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:37:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

12:37:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:37:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:37:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:37:46 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:37:47 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

12:37:48 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:37:49 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

12:37:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:37:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:37:51 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:37:51 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

(You finish reading.)

12:39:49 You grab a large rubber stamp, pound it onto the 08:00 22/09 AEU space defense report, then fling the document into the Outgoing pile.

12:39:51 I see no "report" here.

12:39:53 You grab the door handle as you leave.

12:39:53 The door to the west suddenly closes.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

12:39:53  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

12:39:54 You are carrying nothing.

12:40:01 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

12:40:01 You can go north, east, south, and west.

12:40:09 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

12:40:12 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:40:12 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

12:40:19 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:40:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:40:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:40:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:40:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:40:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:40:50 Which sector did you mean?

12:40:50 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

12:40:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:40:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:40:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

12:40:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:40:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:40:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:40:58 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:40:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

12:41:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:41:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:41:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:41:03 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:41:08 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:41:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:41:37 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

12:41:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

12:41:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:41:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:41:57 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:41:57 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:41:57 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:42:30 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:28:07 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:28:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:28:21 I don't understand that.

19:28:23 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

19:28:23 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.

19:28:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved white top with a colorful butterfly print, a pair of skinny stonewashed purple lowrise jeans with amethyst and deep purple jeweled seashells on the front pockets, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white
19:28:27  gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a star print mandolin case. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
