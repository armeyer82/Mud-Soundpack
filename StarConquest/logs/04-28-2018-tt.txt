Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking
through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed
pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a personal hoverpallet, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst
flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and Purr the
humanoid service robot here.
FCI Scout Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go out.

deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb
slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

we'll have a huge signature."

A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

A wide path through the strange forest continues north for a short distance,
then takes a turn roughly northeast. Toward the south is the landing area. To
the east is another concrete slab, this one covered with loud machinery that
rattles and belches black smoke. Humanoid organisms seem to toil amongst the
machines. They are pale green in color, each with a thick black mane covering
its head and shoulders and completely naked. An orange horn or antenna extends
from the top of the head. The umbrella forest puts part of the slab in shadow,
but many of the humanoids are toiling in the sun, dripping with sweat but
apparently uncomplaining -- in fact, they seem to be working in complete
silence.

something."
FCI Scout Damien Alexander shrugs helplessly.
One of the humanoids asks, "More in sky containers?"
FCI Scout Damien Alexander glances at Jim Gruffudd.
Wendy Arroyo glances back in the general direction of the impromptu landing pad,
the motion somewhat awkward due to her spacesuit.
Melinda Michaels nods to Wendy Arroyo.
The other of the humanoids asks, "More in sky containers?"

speaking mannerisms seem to be similar."

difference in each voice. Remember, the translator doesn't change tone or
anything."

l humanoid
a pair of pale green-skinned humanoids
These humanoids are both taller and bulkier than most of the workers around --
in fact, at least to a human eye, they look nearly identical. Like all of their
species, they have pale green skin with a hint of scales, and dark hair that
grows from the top of their heads to their shoulders, with a long mane hanging
down their backs. They have forward-facing red eyes with vertical pupils, and a
mouth that is too wide for human proportions with stiff lips that are just short
of being able to be called a beak. They are completely naked but do not appear
to have genitalia, just a hole between the legs that is, unfortunately,
impossible not to notice. Small holes at the sides of the head may be nostrils
or ears. Some sort of stiff orange horn or antenna grows from the top of the
head. They have four fingers and toes on each hand and foot, each with a short,
dull claw.
Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Melinda Michaels say, "Yup."
Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."
The pair of humanoids move simultaneously, pushing past the fiber mat covering

[Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Underground Chamber]
This is a large chamber under the earth. It is damp and nearly completely dark
here, lit only by the little sunlight that makes it down the entrance tunnel and
spacesuit lamps. Every few seconds, a burst of warm air emanates through the
chamber, along with a slight vibration and almost inaudibly deep sound, as if
the earth is breathing. Thick fibers are underfoot, network that thickens as it
leads towards the center of the chamber. At that center looms a large fleshy
sphere, clearly organic, colored with striking red and blue striations. The
sphere expands and contracts in time with the ever-present warm wash of air.
More of the silent green-skinned, orange-horned humanoids are here, most
apparently constantly toiling, though some are also lying down among the fibers
on the floor.

[Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Landing Area]
This is a large, flat area, a surface of what appears to be concrete, A dark
green mold seems to have worked its way into every pore of it. Large building-
or starship-sized mounds are also present on the large concrete slab, themselves
covered in what appears to be a thick mat of dark green organic material. The
air seems thick and soupy, and is tinged with a strange orange haze. Surrounding
the concrete slab are tall tree-like organisms, thick-stalked and topped with
umbrella-like structures the color of pale bloodless flesh. Smaller plantoid or
fungoid life seems to thrive in the shadows of these larger organisms, even
growing on the stalks. A rough-hewn path in the forest leads in the local
equivalent of north.
The war galleon "Blackwing Yalobusha" is landed here.

FCI Scout Lily Kaise
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI
patch on the shoulder, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. She is
also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an
orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold
ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling
silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic
purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with
dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals,
and a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer. Her face, both eyes, both wrists,
and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

The ship has undocked from the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes".
The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zéro Des Cartes" has entered the
riftflow.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
Kani Kahakai says, "Nnf..."
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

Morris Corlew sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The
three-dimensional full-color show begins.
[PA] Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn: "There's two episodes out right now let me
check."
Morris Corlew waves.
[From the projector] A cheerful tune begins playing. The words "Wiggly the Cat"
appear, written in cursive and formed from a long orange tail. A moment later
the words "A Film by Annissia Sienna Valdaire and Gwendolyn Arroyo" appear
underneath.
Morris Corlew shuffles south.
[From the projector] As the happy music plays, the first scene appears: a
preteen redhaired girl fumbling with the ribbons on a gift box, then pulling
them loose. The top of the box pops off and a small orange kitten pokes his head
out. The kitten meows piteously and the girl squeals happily. She picks up the
wriggling kitten and hugs him to her chest.
[From the projector] The scene fades to a closer shot of the orange cat looking
just a little bit older and less awkward. He's wearing a collar now with a tag
that has "Wiggly" stamped into it.
[From the projector] The shot pulls wide to show that Wiggly is trotting down a
corridor, following behind his redheaded owner. The scene appears to be on a
space station. There are metal bulkheads and deck plating, and viewports that
show mostly blackness outside, though other stations seem to be floating nearby,
making this station part of a cluster.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn removes a silver holodisc from a black canvas
Fringe gear bag.
[From the projector] The girl turns back to Wiggly with a smile and makes a
"hurry up" gesture. Wiggly breaks into a run to keep up and the girl giggles.
[From the projector] The music turns ominous as the scene changes to focus on a
viewport in one of the station corridors. As the camera very slowly zooms in,
you see the flash of a wormhole opening and an Outsider warship appears. Inside
the station, the lighting turns red and klaxons begin sounding.

[From the projector] The scene changes to a crowded corridor. People are
running, panicking, some even pushing others out of the way. Everyone is heading
for the docking bay and a group of shuttles waiting inside.
[From the projector] The redhaired girl is ahead, the camera moving to catch up
with her as she reaches the hatchway to the docking bay. She turns and looks
down, her face frightened, and the camera pans down to show Wiggly, dodging
running feet as he frantically tries to get to his owner.
Keegan Wantz says, "Uh."
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn puts a silver holodisc titled "Sleeper" in a
black canvas Fringe gear bag.
Keegan Wantz says, "UH."
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn removes a shiny holodisc titled "STELLAR: The

Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn gives a shiny holodisc titled "STELLAR: The
Miscellaneous heist" to Keegan Wantz.
[From the projector] The girl starts after him, but an older man grabs her by
the arm, pulling her forcefully toward the shuttles. The camera is with Wiggly
now, the view frequently blocked by legs and feet as the girl struggles to go
after him. Wiggly is knocked over, sprawling against a bulkhead.
Keegan Wantz says, "Wiggly noooooooo."
[From the projector] When the cat gets back to his feet, the corridor is
starting to clear out. Shuttles are lifting off one by one. His owner is nowhere
to be seen.
[From the projector] Outside the station, shuttles are fleeing, opening
wormholes and vanishing one by one. Soon they're all gone.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, god I can't watch this again."
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Aww."
[From the projector] An Outsider warship moves in close to the station and
lingers there for a moment. A flat beam shoots out of it and roams over the
station, clearly representing some kind of scan. When the scan completes, the
warship floats there for another long moment, then silently moves on. The music
fades.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Not a date film."
Keegan Wantz says, "No human life."
[From the projector] Back inside the station, everything seems calm again, the
lighting back to plain white. Wiggly pads through empty corridors, meowing every
so often. He seems to be the only living thing aboard.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.
Keegan Wantz says, "Okay."
Keegan Wantz says, "But."
[From the projector] Wiggly comes to a closed hatch. He sits down in front of it
and stares up for a moment, then he jumps up and slaps at the door control with
his paw. The hatch slides open, revealing living quarters.
Keegan Wantz says, "No more humans..."
[From the projector] The cat walks inside and sniffs at a bowl with his name on
it. It's empty. He pads into another room, a little girl's bedroom. On the bed
is a fuzzy green sweater. Wiggly jumps up onto it, curls up, and heaves a sigh
before closing his eyes. The scene fades to black.
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Whoever said this was a date movie."
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "You are a fucking monster."
[PA] Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn: "Thank you!"
[From the projector] Wiggly is padding through a corridor again. He stops and
stares up at a hatch. It's labeled "Emergency Ration Storage." With a leap and a
smack of his paw, the hatch is toggled open.
[PA] Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn: "I've been saying this."
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yeah I hate films that
make me cry..."
[From the projector] The cat jumps up and knocks one of many plain white boxes
to the deck. He follows it down and starts ripping it open with his claws. When
he's made a big enough hole, he sticks his head in and begins eating.
Lily sobs.
[From the projector] The scene fades out for a long moment, and when the station
appears again, there is a layer of dust over everything. Some of the lights are
flickering. Wiggly looks older, nothing of a kitten left about him. He's padding
through a corridor, his head down.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "You just can't do this
to a cat lover! Noooooo!"
[From the projector] Suddenly, something catches his eye. He jumps up to a
viewport, his claws scrabbling for a moment before he holds himself in place. He
stares, his whiskers twitching.
squeeze lily
You squeeze Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise affectionately.
[From the projector] Across space, at a different station, at a different
viewport, is the distant figure of a cat. Wiggly lifts one paw to the viewport.
As he sees that the other cat is doing the same, he lets out a small meow.
[From the projector] The film becomes a montage as sad, slow music plays. Short
scenes play: Wiggly wandering through empty corridors. Wiggly at the viewport,
looking out at the other lonely cat in the other station. Wiggly eating from the
rations. Over time, the station grows dimmer, more and more of its lights
fading. The pile of ripped open ration boxes grows bigger and bigger. And Wiggly
seems to spend more and more time staring out the viewport at his companion.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Aww it's just a mirror immage."
[From the projector] A scene inside the ration storage room lingers. Wiggly is
nosing around in the ripped open boxes. The camera pans up, showing that the
shelves are bare. Wiggly meows and wanders slowly out of the room.
[From the projector] The camera follows Wiggly through dusty, dim corridors of
flickering light. The water recycling system has even sprung a leak, leaving
water to run down one of the walls.
[From the projector] Wiggly comes to his favorite viewport and jumps up to take
a look. His companion is there, just a fuzzy outline from this distance. Wiggly
lifts a paw and plants it against the viewport, and so does his friend. Wiggly's
whiskers droop slowly and he jumps down.
[From the projector] The small cat sits on the deck, slumped over. He stays
still as the camera zooms in on him slowly.
[From the projector] After some long moments, Wiggly's ears twitch. His whiskers
lift. He looks up sharply, suddenly determined. He trots off down the corridor,
picking up speed as he goes.
[From the projector] Wiggly stops in front of a thick hatch. He sits, swishes
his tail back and forth, then jumps up and smacks the door control. As the hatch
slides open and Wiggly pads in, the camera pans up to show the label above it:
"AIRLOCK. STAND CLEAR."
Gonzales Bourne waves.
[From the projector] Through the airlock's viewport, you see the neighboring
station where his companion lives, not so far away. Wiggly looks at it for a
moment, then turns back to the door controls. He jumps up and seals the hatch
into the station, then sits back down, still looking up, his tail swishing
again.
wave gonz
You wave to Gonzales Bourne.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise waves to Gonzales Bourne.
[From the projector] The camera shows a big red button with a cover over it, and
Wiggly sitting on the deck below, looking up. He jumps, his paw batting at the
cover, but he fails to move it. He tries again and fails again. Finally, the
third time, he manages to dislodge the cover and expose the button.
[From the projector] Wiggly heaves a breath. He jumps one more time, his paw
slapping onto the big red button. The airlock's lighting turns red and a klaxon
sounds. Just a moment later, the external hatch slides open. The airlock's
atmosphere is blown out into space, carrying the small orange cat with it. The
music stops and the film goes completely silent.
Gonzales Bourne asks, "What happenned since blockading?"
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Smart kittycat but he's going to starve to
death and I can't deal."
[From the projector] Wiggly twists himself around as he's propelled through
space, turning to face the neighboring station. The familiar viewport he's spent
so much time looking at is just a little off to the side, and he wiggles that
way, trying to steer himself toward it, but it doesn't have much effect.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise sighs.
[From the projector] As he gets closer to the station, Wiggly's companion
appears in the viewport, clearly seen for the first time. It's another little
orange cat, just like Wiggly! The other cat's eyes widen in surprise.
[From the projector] The other cat's whiskers are beginning to glimmer with
frost.
[From the projector] The cat raises its paw, and the camera swings around to
show Wiggly making the same motion at the same moment.
Gonzales Bourne scrambles to his feet.
Gonzales Bourne sprints south.
[From the projector] The camera pans over the top of the station... revealing a
large hole in the middle of it, gutted by Outsider weaponry. This station has
clearly been dead since the attack, unpowered and pitch black inside.
[From the projector] Wiggly's struggles stop as he realizes he's only trying to
reach his own reflection. He goes limp as he gives up, and his eyes close as he
tumbles slowly in the harsh vacuum of space.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise cries.
[From the projector] The scene fades slowly to total blackness.
[From the projector] A single sad note plays, held for long moments.
[From the projector] The view remains black as the note fades out.
[From the projector] Suddenly, there is a flash of white.
[From the projector] The flash fades and the scene is centered on Wiggly. Some
force has caught him, pulling him away from the station he was drifting towards.
He jerks once.
[From the projector] The scene cuts to show a starship control board, focusing
on its monochrome screen. The screen prints the text "Debris recovered."
[From the projector] "Scanning..."
[From the projector] "Life form."
[From the projector] A figure wearing a gray shipsuit leaps up from the pilot's
seat and swings through a hatch into the storage room. On the deck is an orange
cat, looking very small and still.
[From the projector] The pilot drops to her knees, scoops up the little cat, and
hugs him to her chest as long red hair falls over her shoulders.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Aww."
Keegan Wantz shivers.
[From the projector] The woman lets out a sob. A long moment passes. Then Wiggly
squirms weakly, meows piteously, and buries his head in the crook of the woman's
arm. She hugs him tighter.
Lily still cries.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
'Awww
You say, "Awww."
[From the projector] THE END.
The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.

Keegan Wantz sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The
three-dimensional full-color show begins.
[From the projector] the view opens up with a stylized picture of the solar
system. the sun is located in the middle of the screen while all the planets out
to Pluto are bright dots of light of varying colors. A picture of a petite
oriental woman with fine angular cheekbones and almond shaped eyes appears and
slides to the upper left corner. Tai Chan Sing is captioned under the photo.
[From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen.
Some of the most notable are one of Tai holding a datapad and switching her view
from it to the landscape while pointing out landmarks and giving instructions to
the rest of her team. As she points at Sephronia and finds her gone she begins
to pull at her hair in frustration. Another is of Tai folding down into the
lotus position inside a Victorian decorated room while two of her teammates
watch over her and the street below. The last is of Tai holding an oversized
rifle and screaming as a burst of plasma is ejected into a crowd of enemy ninja
bots.

You squeeze Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise affectionately.
[From the projector] Coming back to the view of the solar system the camera has
moved closer and shifted so that the third bright light from the sun is
beginning to become the center focus. Another picture flashes onto the screen of
a mid-twenties white male with fashionably mussed hair and perfect features.
Captioned at the bottom of the picture is the name William "Billboard" Stanton.
The picture moves up to the lower  right corner of the view.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise leans on you.
[From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen.
Some of the most notable are one of William sitting in a well lit chair with a
woman dusting his face while RHC512 floats around. A second one of William
trying to evade reality show fanatics while tossing out bags of Chippy chips
over his shoulder and screaming  "They are all autographed." Lastly, one of
William, in his powered armor, and a bat winged figure floating in space pushing
an enormous rock closer to a softly glowing distortion.

Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise laughs.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise exclaims, "Damn I needed this!"
[From the projector] Returning yet again to the view of the system, the camera
is noticeably closer to Earth. A third picture joins the scene. This one is an
average looking woman of no distinct racial features. Her bright green eyes and
mischievous grin are quite notable though. As the picture slides into the upper
right corner it is captioned with the name Sephronia Elizabeth Camilla
Miles-English.
[From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen.
Some of the most notable are one of Sephronia leaning  over a workbench while
working on some oddly designed device. A second one of the team standing beside
and behind Sephronia with their hands on her shoulders while a hazy image
superimposes over reality showing a man being assaulted. Finally, one of
Sephronia facing off against twelve men in black body armor and performing
insane feats of martial arts leaving several of them laid out on the dusty
ground.
The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Scary theory over here."
[From the projector] The camera is getting close enough to Earth at this point
to begin to make out continental features and cloud formations. A new picture
appears. this one is a stocky woman of middle years with messy hair to her
shoulders and a medium sized pin on her lapel reading Recycle or else! Captioned
below the picture as it slides to the bottom left corner is the name Addy Sue
Stevens.
Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hm?"
[From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen.
Some of the most notable are one of Addy looking up from under the hood of some
machine and wiping her hands only to realize there is a fight all around her and
her team yelling at her to help. A second of Addy gesticulating while
frantically trying to talk her team into destroying a building. Lastly, one of
Addy facing down a large group of enemies and expanding her arms above her head
as though opening something, a large rock fall appears directly above the enemy
group and tons of rock fall out of the sky.
[From the projector] The camera is still closing on the planet as features of a
megacity in the northeastern portion of North America can be made out. A final
picture is placed in the center of the view. A handsome, fine featured male with
tanned skin, excellently styled hair and razor straight eyebrows. Just before
all the photos fade away this last one is captioned with the name of David Li
Wang.
The voice of Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"What is this frightening theory?"
[From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen.
Some of the most notable are one of David standing outside a shop staring at
himself in the window adjusting his black suit, while in the reflection a brawl
is occurring in the street behind him. Another one is David in workout clothes
performing a martial arts routine in front of children in poses of rapt
attention. Finally, one of David being attacked by a humanoid robot and
thrusting his hand forward which results in the robot being thrown across the
room.
[From the projector] The camera is focusing on one particular building near the
coast. As it rotates and circles in we get a view of a side. In a final rush
downwards the words "Space and Time Elite Liaisons for the League of Active
Reconnaissance" in rapid succession. As the door at street level comes into view
STELLAR slams onto the screen as though from a giant, only moderately inked,
stamp. Just under and to the right of the stamp is the title, "The Miscellaneous
heist."
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ok
so...I was thinkin. What if Hwoof-Hoom is the only non-alien? That...the
humanoids were at one time visitors like us and the Outsider...that
they've...the humanoids...the originals populated with the help of
Hwoof-Hoom...and that there could be little Outsiders runnin round there at some
point down the road."
Keegan Wantz says, "This is."
[From the projector] Tai, Sephronia, Addy, William, and David are sitting around
a conference table discussing what they did last weekend.
The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "But
controlled by the sphere...by Hwoof-Hoom."
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise nods to Keegan Wantz.
[From the projector] A disgruntled red headed middle aged male (McDougal) enters
the room and throws down several file folders onto the table.
Keegan Wantz says, "A pretty generic film, I think."
[From the projector] McDougal says, "We need you all to get your asses to Mars
and figure who has been making off with all this technology." He then proceeds
to  point at different pages in his copy of the file folder while everyone else
scrambles to get one.
Keegan Wantz chuckles.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "I can't focus on it it's too chaotic for me."
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise laughs.
[From the projector] "They stolen parts from Tech Enterprises, Monico Inc,
Purple star Memory, and we're not sure if it is connected but Grand Grocery."
Pacing back and forth at the head of the table McDougal then says, "Your job,
whether you like it or not, is to get out there and find out who's been stealing
these things, find out why, and apprehend them. Normally this technology is
innocent enough on its own but we have reason to believe, or at least the
crackpots in engineering do anyway, that in some combinations this technology
could be used for a variety of really  nasty, mind boggling crimes. That
probably means they don't have a clue but we can't work on that assumption."
The voice of Blockade Smasher Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift
comm, saying, "Holy fuck. That's scary, and possible, and...I'm never sleeping
again."
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over
an overturned tree.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet

Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise gives you a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of
Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.
[From the projector] The scene switches to the team sitting around the
conference table following the pacing of McDougal back and forth. Tai Chan Sing
clears her throat and in a surprisingly  melodious voice asks, "Excuse me
Director McDougal, have the investigation teams been over the crime scenes?"
almost on top of Tai, Sephronia Elizabeth Camilla, Miles-English jumps up and
proclaims in what starts to be an authoritative voice, "We'll get to the bottom
of this!" Her voice trailing off into an interrogative as she glances around and
sees not everyone is as enthusiastic as she is.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet
of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.
[From the projector] The team suddenly jumps to their feet in surprise as from
off camera McDougal shouts, "Well, what are you waiting for? go! Go! Go!"
Lily says to you, "Ready?"
[From the projector] The agents scramble around and over the table in an effort
to get away from the perpetually angry director and make their way out of the
room and to an equipment room where rows upon rows of weapons, gadgets, and
armors are stored.
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley
floor pillow with thick silver fringe.
[From the projector] A few minutes of pointless banter pass between the agents
as they gear up with knives, guns, portable devices and various other gadgetry.
Then a technician walks up to Tai and asks, "You are the team leader, right?"
Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise walks south.
[From the projector] Tai Chan Sing looks around as if not really wanting to take
on the responsibility for the rest of the group but nods resignedly and turns
her full attention to the technician asking, "What have they done now?"
[From the projector] The technician smirks knowingly and thrusts out a clipboard
with a paper attached. "I just need you to sign for the new prototype equipment
we are sending out with you. You'll also need to stop by the outfitter to pick
it up."
[From the projector] Later the team of agents can be seen walking out of a huge
skyscraper with STELLAR in blocky letters above the entrance rubbing the back of
their necks and grimacing. the scene soon transitions to them boarding a
starship that is jetting small white clouds  from several nozzles arranged
around the hull.
A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it
recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.
[From the projector] Later inside the starship the camera pans around, catching
views of the agents at their various ship duties, finally coming to focus on a
window where Mars can be seen getting larger, rapidly.
A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through
into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.
[From the projector] William is the first one out of the ship with a wave as
though he fully expects his adoring fans to be present and waiting just for him.
Tai, David, and Sephronia step out shortly after. there is a pause and then Tai
yells back into the ship, "Addy, wake up!" Whereupon Addy comes out wiping drool
from her chin, muttering something about alarms.
[From the projector] Tai looks around and sighs at the team, "Let's go check the
crime scenes." William is crestfallen seeing no fans waiting for him on the
landing pad. David takes a moment to fix his hair in the reflection of the hull.
Sephronia peers about quizzically and says, "I thought Mars was red."
[From the projector] The team make their way to a large blocky vehicle with
tinted windows and landing struts where wheels normally would be positioned, and
pile in. taking off in the vehicle they zoom away as the landing struts retract
and William rolls down his window as he finally sees the adoring fans he
expected as he exited the ship. From a side pocket on his pants he pulls out a
thick stack of glossy photos and begins tossing them into the crowd while RHC512
hovers up from the roof and rotates slowly getting a good wide angle view of the
exchange.
Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "This one seems really genericly
actiony, Hawthorn."
[From the projector] Following the vehicle from a high perspective the picture
shows pedestrians going about their business along a geometrically straight
street lined on either side by buildings that tower off the top of the view and
extend off into the distance. The scenery is very uniform and boring.
The voice of Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Hey, is Jim there with you guys?"
Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "He
went to his quarters, we think."
[PA] Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn: "Don't look at me. It was better than the
tear jerker on my date."
[From the projector] As the vehicle pulls up outside yet another tower block
building and is received by the opening hatch that leads below street level, the
team stop  and step out, letting the vehicle make its own way into a parking
space in the garage. Tai looks pointedly at the group and declares, "I'll do all
the talking if we have to actually deal with anyone." The group  looks around
before nodding and following Tai inside the building's entrance.
[From the projector] Pulling out a datapad and swiping across it a few times,
Tai pulls up a schematic of the building that shows a large red portion. the
team of agents make their way down corridors, past doors of various sizes as
well as a few alcoves with statuary in them. After taking a lift up a few floors
they arrive at a security checkpoint which is covered with a web of yellow and
red tape stretched across it reading "Do Not Enter under pain of prosecution"
[From the projector] Tai, Sephronia, David, Addy, and William spread out across
the area carefully going over portions of the room with scanners and delicate
tools. From off camera you hear David exclaim, "Boss, someone had a bad hair day
over here!" The team of agents continue looking over the place until Tai is
satisfied there isn't anything else to be found.
The voice of Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"Did you all get any scans off of the humanoids, or other lifeforms? Maybe if
they are not indiginous, with the right kinds of scans you might be able to
narrow down where to find them."
[From the projector] As everyone gathers near the door preparing to leave
Sephronia taps Tai on the shoulder and says, "Can I take a look back? come on,
you know I can, I can do it, I want to do it, please just let me do it, I know
you know I can and want me to, awesome I'll do it." At each slight pause Tai
opens her mouth to respond but can't quite get a word in edgewise. In the
background you can just make out Addy fiddling with some device, it looks like
she might be trying to pry the control panel off it.
[From the projector] Spinning around Sephronia takes a moment to collect herself
then begins to concentrate with a glare and the tip of her tongue pokes out the
corner of her mouth. In just a few seconds the scene distorts and is replaced
with an almost identical scene save the seven foot tall, lean, purple  skinned,
monstrosity skulking around the room browsing shelves and occasionally pulling
down items. As it turns around one corner of a shelf it brushes against it and 
lets out an uncharacteristic squeak while putting a hand to its head. The
distortion wavers and the scene is back to an empty room with various
identification cones and dust  stains.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly
unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts
shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs
of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem
strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric
designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over
it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed
pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a personal hoverpallet, Purr the humanoid service robot, a white four

Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.
The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.
With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly
fades to formless mist.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly
emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the
dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench
and the sounds of battle.
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Rest well Morris."
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Mmhmm. Y'all two when you get there."
An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left
leg is soaked in blood.
Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and
mangled stump where his right arm once was.
[PA] Melinda Michaels: "Yo Jim, if you are awake, the other ship has concerns
about keeping something from happening to Georgie and wish to voice them with
you."
An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the
fog.
Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take
cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light
instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of
brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked,
"GO!"
Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem
to make any sense.
Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem

The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."
You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship
several spaces.
Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the
entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.
The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.
A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to

A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been
replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the
clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the
world.

The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once
more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.
The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the
back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through
deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and
no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping
to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.
The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb
slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes
close slowly and it appears to sleep.
The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor
carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.
A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.
The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to
be in its driver's seat.
The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.
The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Anybody else?"
[PA] Morris Corlew: "Steppin out."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.
Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face
backwards.
The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.
Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face
backwards.
Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.
The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the
water.
The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and
purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped

Lily Kaise says, "I'll sure miss my fish."
You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.
The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing
on the hull.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through
into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place
isn't right.
You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.
The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.
Lily Kaise walks out.

Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take

instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be
constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear
a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden
and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the
windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches
away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the
riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed
pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service
robot, a personal hoverpallet, Purr the humanoid service robot, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a
large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a large oval dark purple and light purple
cloth rug here.

brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked,

Subject: Thank you
Author: Jim Gruffudd

I know everyone has a lot of questions, and believe me, my team is doing its
best to draw what conclusions we can from the data we gathered. While it might
be tempting to believe we left in defeat, we did complete our primary
objectives. We confirmed the accuracy of the Outsider databanks. We discovered
who and what the Fwoof-Foom are. And we made contact... of a sort. In addition,
we got the first up close and personal look at an Outsider blockade station, as
well as the first kill of one, a feat that will stun the team back home. I will
ensure both crews receive due credit for that accomplishment.
If you feel we left in haste, I apologize. I have scouted many, many unexplored
planets, and lost friends and colleagues in the process. One of my primary
instructions to you all was, "Don't get greedy." We suffered a casualty almost
immediately upon making contact with this species. With our primary objectives
fulfilled, my gut told me it would be too risky to try for a bonus round. While
I've been nothing but impressed with the way these crews have conducted
themselves, it's also the case that none of you are trained in first contact or
survival on alien worlds. I didn't want to be responsible for any casualties
among you, especially when a couple of you began talking like you wanted to
follow in Georgie's footsteps.
I am told that Georgie is stable for now. He has been kept sedated and we aren't
sure how he'll progress. We don't know what affect the alien spores may have on
him. We hope the answer is "none," but given that we witnessed an Outsider with
one of those head stalks, I'm not willing to just assume that he'll be fine.
Whatever happens, we will be back. This was only the first step. Even if the
Fwoof-Foom will never be our allies, every world and every species has something
to teach us. When we come back, we'll be prepared. Forewarned is forearmed. We
will keep trying to achieve rational discourse with this species, and all of you
will have a place in that process, if you want it.
And once again, thank you. All of you.

I fully support your decision to leave and thanks for clarifying a little more.
Safety of the crew is of the utmost importance.
I for one, will be happy to go on any mission that there is a spot for me on.
We were told to expect the unexpected and, boy we got that. Again, thank you for
working with us.

Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.
They're just using you.
Remember what I said.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around
them.
The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you
from their seats.

A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.

indifferent to its surroundings.
The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.
[PA] Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn: "I'm awake."
A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming
countless mouths, gasping for relief.

You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness
gives way to swirling mist.
The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the
dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as
the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to
swirling mist.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify.
The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while
snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

Bolts of lightning crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic
crater.
You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine
where they are coming from.

The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.
The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in,
obscuring your vision.
The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the
back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through
deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.
Lily Kaise lies back on a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it and
