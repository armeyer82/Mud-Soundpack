00:08 You grin.

00:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:09 Lily Kaise removes a decoy beacon from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

00:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:09 Lily Kaise loads a decoy beacon into a decoy beacon launcher.

00:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Steel Phoenix Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:09 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

00:11 Casen Thale's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Also - I meant to ask over comms, but since you're both here, where will I find an autovector to purchase? I've had trouble finding it listed in any of the component stores I've been to."

00:11 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Oh, it's on the torus."

00:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:11 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "At the xenology center on the torus."

00:11 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah in the Xenology Center there."

00:11 You lift a small plastic cover and press a yellow button.

00:11 You hear three quick beeps and glance up to see yellow lights flick on overhead as the ship enters yellow alert.

00:11 Casen Thale's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ahhhh. I didn't think to look in the Xenology center there. Thank you."

00:12 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There is a room adjacent to it where you can find that plus other upgrades."

00:12 You notice that your hair is now mid-back length.

00:12 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok, it's been a while so please forgive my rusty flying."

01:35 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:35 You're already sitting.

01:43 You peer out...

01:43 
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The three-person clipper "Obliteration", the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

01:43 You scramble to your feet.

01:43 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:43 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:43 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:43 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:43 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:43 You are carrying nothing.

01:43 [Old Frontier Processor; Asteroid Mining]

01:43 You see a large leather couch, a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt, a shiny waterfall blue Professional Chef hot pizza synthesizer with chrome accents, and a small natural golden brown trash bin here.

22:20 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

22:20 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Hi Love,
It is now estimated that we will depart on this Expedition in as early as in one to two weeks.
Melinda wants to know which two Battlesuits you are most comfortable with using and what Tiers you have for low and high. Please let her know by dropping her a note in the mail or calling.
You may want to bring your Cruiser and/or any other ships you own from New Earth to the Torus as we have no idea what may follow us up on our return.
As for Felo, after 30 days have elapsed, we'll have to find reliable people to transport our felo ships to the landing pad and feed from the Repair shop. I may just downsize what I currently have from the Mule because I've tried to maintain Soldiers in the Mule and just have a handful. I have a number of Soldiers and otherwise in the other ship so may combine the soldiers from the mule and take the others to Hyperion. At any rate, since noone else can reset the robots but whomever owns them, after 30 days and if we've not returned, this means someone should transport the ships to the Landing area and feed from the Repair shop or manually feed from bags of chow. Obviously, if it is an AEU pilot, they won't necessarily be feeding manually. The cost is 250K credits per feeding per ship so would need to advance whomever feeds for you the credits. I personally don't have anyone in mind either as Kim probably would do it but she isn't at work very often. I'm sure the felo would likely be ok f
22:21 or a few days after the robots stop Caretaking so they may manage if we aren't away beyond 35 to 37 days. I will put Shine and Sunshine into my Pulsar as it has 16 rooms or if you wouldn't mind, I can put them in your Cruiser as I can put down more bowls. or I could use the organization's Cruiser for them as it has so many more rooms and they would be ok for months, perhaps over six months since just the two don't require much Felo Chow.
I'll bring the fish tanks and worst case, we keep them on a hoverpallet and feed manually.
We need to be certain that we make preparations to be ready to depart with short notice for as soon as a in a week or two. I hope it's the latter so I can put up our next scoop so that we would have at least one working for us for 16 days. I'll at least have one or two ready to deploy.
I'm sure glad I thought to prepare the organization's assets.
I love you,
Lily

22:35 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

22:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

22:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:37 I don't understand that.

22:37 I don't understand that.

22:37 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

Melinda,
For battle suits I have: Testudinidae (tiers 3 and 5), Fringe (tier 4), AEU (tiers 3 and 5) and EAOS (tiers 3 and 4). I am most comfortable with AEU tier 3, Fringe 4 and EAOS 3 and 4. I can use the other suits as well, but am not as comfortable. Hope this helps.

22:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:51 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

22:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:51 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:51 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:55 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

22:55 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Hmm, I couldn't."

22:56 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Could wait for the camp."

22:57 [Tactical Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Hmm, yeah. I haven't done my deep yet, but I suppose I don't need to do deeps first."

22:57 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Same, you don't have to."
