Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from
somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  A standalone starmap viewer
appears to be installed here.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on
fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows flanked by sheer gold
curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy
bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk
blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I could be
wrong on this one, but exploration ships should inform you when you find things.
I think other ships need the notification component to do that."

transmits, "Explorations ships inform you? I got the autostop upgrade just in
case."

notification ensures you get notified of points of interests.

"That's for ships that don't have exploration grade sensors. The low level

mess."

to put hte scientific sensor rigging on my ships when it didn' thave much use,
just because it made my ships look all scienced up. They were also super cheap

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole

Cafe would have any,  but I checked anyways. They only have green tea."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I am pouting, though
you can not see it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh well, I guess it's
just easier to get folks to go to cicero's than it is to get them to buy
sandwiches and cookies."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Hyperion has bigger issues than
snack foods."

what are your thoughts on current situations with AEU government? I have been
curious."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Guess he's in the head
or something."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well I found some baked
potatoes, but not by themselves."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Must've been quite the fall."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They don't count."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You look like a
baked potato."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Hey now."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not exactly sure how
they don't count, but ok."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Because they aren't on their
own. And you can't get fillings in them. Right?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Oh baby."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Quiet you."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "One has sour cream and
the other has cheese and bacon."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Mmmm."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah gasps.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sounds like a
baked potato to me."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Where!"
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Is there not something more
productive to do than find things to eat?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Sour cream in my potato baby."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "An interesting
question."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "At this point, Kelsey taking a piss
is probably more productive to current climate than that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well. I'd always be down for
the graves. But it's finding others with the right colors."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It took me all of ten
minutes."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You see, we're
technically on strike. We really don't have any interesting things to do at the
moment. I mean, I suppose we could spend some of that time shooting down
Outsider patrols, but we can't spend -every- moment shooting down outsider
patrols, you know?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Do you have yellow?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I do have yellow. I also
have blue."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "That's hot. We should go some
time."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Even diverting patrols
makes the aliance money. I wouldn't even do that if it wasn't important work."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There. You see?
Eli's got it."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Speak."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "A strike isn't supposed to be
just not working."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Loud."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Be annoying."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, we're
working on that...thing. Eli, how's the thing going!? Oh wait, you already said
we couldn't get it until after negotiations were done."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa sighs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was speaking with
fellow pilots today,  not everything happens on general comms."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We should. Joel. I'm quite
the GMG freak. Sadly. I'd stay out there for days at a time if I could.
That's...potentially lame."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle laughs.
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Not to me."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Best is a pile of shite. Yell it
every moment you have."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, you see,
I have done something productive, just by mentioning the strike! Cause now it's
being discussed again, and is now at the forefront of thoughts!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I believe you were one
of the ones who told me that eylling is worthless, and that actions were more
valuable?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er yelling, that is."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Talking."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "She probably
said that before the actions and now wants yelling after the actions."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "You must make yourselves thorn in
his side."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Demand sit downs with the
government every single day so they can hear your demands. Picket New Earth and
stop merchant traffic from getting through. Set up public demonstrations."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Sitting back and waiting for
whatever you guys are waiting for just lets him ignore you."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "We were working
on the latter."
[General Communication] Aisling assaults your ears with a burst of static and
screeching feedback as she transmits at the top of her lungs, "BEST IS A GIANT
PILE OF SHITE, THE MOST WRETCHED OF HUMAN FILTH, A DISEASE ON HUMANITY, AND IT
WILL BE HEARD!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The problem with
picketing is that we need a permit, and we'll just get tossed in jail. I'm sure
they'd love nothing more than for us to try something like that."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, you
apparently need a permit for every fucking thing you want to organize."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Trust us! We
have been firing off ideas to one another back and forth until our eyes and
optics units hurt!"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "How do I not have your number
Evenia?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You should. You've called me
like twice."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Odd."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It is also in the directory,
however."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Boom. I am victorious."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has angular shoulders and slightly
smaller than average breasts. Her abdomen is firm and punctuated by a small
navel. Her face is heart-shaped, lightly-freckled, and subtly asymmetrical, with
a delicate nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rosy and
occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of arched
eyebrows, her eyes are blue-grey and narrow. Her shoulder-length, wavy hair is
coppery red and swept back from her face into a mass of tousled curls. She has
long clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a vividly painted red and gold dragon mask with gleaming white
teeth and curved golden horns, a short dark red cotton tee with a glittery
shooting star printed on the front, a tasteful silver watch with diamond
accents, a silver link chain with a red jasper rose suspended from it around her
waist, a pair of faded red low rise cut-offs, and a pair of cross-strapped light

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Quite."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I dunno how many times I
considered donating billions to my apartment complex to get them to install a
medical facility."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I hear ya on that one."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why not just buy your
own personal medical creche."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hey, that could work."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well I'd do that too. If
they were available, they'd certainly make money out of me."

a couple large aquariums of aquapedes?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You just said my weakness.
I'll take 'em."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I would take one."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Where are ya Caleb?"
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "I just would need to find a
place for fish food."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Bubbling but shall be on my
way back soonish."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Awesome caleb, you take at
least one. I'm fish crazy."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well if there's any
left I'll take one, I don't have any."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Eli can have the other
Morris, if Caleb doesn't want them both."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok. Eve, you have a key to the
tug. Caleb I'll send ya a key. There's a small aquarium and two large ones.
Y'all two figure out which of the large ones ya want. I'm givin away the entire
aquariums."

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hey. I gave up my claim. You
want fish. I can give you fish. I've got way the fuck too many as it is."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Funny thing is, I'm
pretty sure that Eve has like eight and a half milion aquapeds already."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er aquapedes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eli, if you're near Old Earth,
you can come look at 'em."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Otherwise I'll send ya a key."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I do. Which is why I gave up
my claim. I'm only hunting gold ones. Or ones with certain shells. And I've got
tons of eggs I could share. No charge."

taking them?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's two."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But he's not taking
both?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah. That's why I said to
Morris you could have the other one, when you called for it."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I actually have a wall
aquarium I've been considering giving away, fish and all."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm makin keys now Eli, you
want one or you wanna come over?"
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "One of those would be nice
if I had an apartment."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You can fit them inside a
scout I think. But...I gotta cut down my fish somehow."

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well then. We can talk fish.
When I'm not bubbling. I'll gladly shair."

with folks if anybody's up for it. I've got all red and dark red, so it's time
for some new genes."

like "Hey Eve. I don't want these aquariums. Will you take them?" I said yes.
not realizing how freaking many he had."

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Exactly. I mean at least he
did the right thing by the fish like. Not just starving them. But I'm overrun."

steel? I have steel."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm kinda loathe to part with
the dark reds as I ain't seen many of them, but I could probably part with one."

I'll just give you some."

tradin."

that key. I let folks hang onto keys for the tug so in case nobody around who
has felo of their own needs 'em for bari."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "For some reason I can't
figure out, the steels breed like crazy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "These guys do too. My soldier

somewhere here."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I saw the most adorable tiny
one when I checked on them when you were away. I was very tempted, but I didn't
touch it."

don't mind folks switchin 'em out."

off in the gunner's chair."

bring over the tug, and pop in a couple steel, and grab a couple of the red.

aren't going to space themselves."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli, would
it be insanity to outfit a carrier with a rift drive and enough sensor upgrades
to fly out to a remote artifact field carrying a scout and a module scout."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the north.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Set up a temp
xenology station, and just live out there for a few days?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do people do
that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess it's
moot since the carrier is the one ship I probably have no way to get to
farport."
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, there's
no reason why you couldn't do that, but you'd probably want to know what field
you were going to first, the sensors on a carrier aren't too great for that. I
believe they are classified as utility sensors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figured
I'd ask for a heading and go out to a known field."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And yes, I
believe thre's soem folks that do that. Aslo, there's not really any reason why
you would even need to build the xenology station, you can always turn the
artifacts in when you get back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that's true.
I mainly just figured the station would be a good place to park the carrier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess all the
xenology module would do is make its battery drain faster, though, huh?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But it's not
a bad idea to do it. I think folks usually just plan artifact trips and go otu
in groups though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I wouldn't
want to be out for days alone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah it
would, but again, it doesn't have to last for a week or anything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have to
have 300 exploration to get points for an alien artifact?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No idea on

furhter out."

wondering about people with like 40 exploration."

anything."

enough."

that are my passion."

I think you are slightly underestimating the number of points you need for
certain exploration upgrades."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And just do
those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though maybe
that's just because I've been doing it every day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh really? From
Ather's book it looks like 3000 gets you everything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "To get the
best probes, you need 20000."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that not the
case?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sorry, I wasn't
paying attention. What were we talking about that required 20000 points?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Exploration
points are probably the main ones you always need, if you want to do those kinds
of things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Planetary
probes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh,
interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Lander probes
require 15000 and the best lander requires 20000."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So even if I got
3000 exploration in the next month, my probes would be terrible."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Probes sound like a
lot of fun."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And my
expeditions wouldn't be lucrative or enticing to most people."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actualy the
3000 probes are decent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's
good to hear."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But folks
don't get credit for them unless they qualify for them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So, maybe it
would be good for someone to lead some with lower tier probes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like on the
expidition I went on, I got credit for al the probes used that were under 5000,
but I didn't get credit for any of the 5000 ones that got used."

about expeditions I don't know."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The more you get it to love
you, the more you'll see it do."

new environment they don't do it quite so easily for awhile. But just wait till
he stares into your heart and soul."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That too."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right? The soul stair
is...somethin' else."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And even if
folks don't qualify for the spectrometry stuff, they'll still get at least
partial credit for planet finds, even if they don't qualify for the surveyor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "As well as
imaging."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But when he starts demanding
you sit down for a cuddle...that's just kick ass."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do attached
ships give the platform a cargo hold?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs. "I ain't seen that yet, but could
be 'cause I generally don't just stand somewhere."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have we been
over this?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't
remember."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Vernos, for
example, got nothing for any of our probes, but he still got points and partial
poitns for imaging and planet finds."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "He'll give you this. Strong
feeling that you need to sit down. When you do. Bounce. Lap felo."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think they
have a cargo hold yes, no docking bay."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I love when they want
em to sit down, it's too cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that's
right."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's completely adorable.
When sneaky first did that to me, I thought I was truly going nuts."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's like this
feeling that you want to sit down, but you can kinda tell it's not your own
thought."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eventually I'll likely be
givin all these guys away. Right now I've got 4 ships of felo and it's just way
too much."

be able to take some."

maned. I have a wonderful mean ship."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Then later multiply it by 4."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "With the ones with the
telepath gene, I really wanna find pilots that'll put a couple on their ships to
keep the gene goin rather than take 'em to the sanctuary. And you can have all
the ones on my ruabout right now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's the mean hummers and
maned from the HLV."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do they use mental
attacks on bari?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno. That's somethin I've
been wantin to experiment with."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll gladly take them. But
yeah. I agree. It'd be good to keep the gene healthy. I'd certainly make sure
that happened if I took some."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If they make a bari
warriors head explode.. I just.. There's no words for how awesome that would
be."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I ain't quite ready to do it
yet, but I'll let you and everybody else know."

36 total? Somethin like that. So plenty to go round."

kay yeah, there's no words for how epic fucking cool that would be."

same time as giving you some steel."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both
biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist,
both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both
feet are left uncovered.

"Excuse me is this just amongst a select few and if not, why weren't we all
notified?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, since he
didn't bother sending a communicator notice about it, and there was only like
two of us here or something when he said it, you think you could send out a
communicator notice from your terminal when you get a chance?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, good idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, sure."

he hasn't announced it."

actually what I was trying to tell Constantine to take care of Lily, I' not sure
why he waited so long to tell anyone or why he didn't send a notice."

it was just me, constantine and Dakhal when he said it."

"Meeting in his head?"

what the terms of the old agreement were."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He told me

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Who knows,
Lily. Maybe you are right about it being in his head? He did kinda seem like he
just rolled over and said it and then went back to sleep. Hopefully it was not
something he was supposed to confirm to Lambeth. There's always a chance we'll
show up and no one will come because it wasn't confirmed."

I was Voice, I don't remember ever seeing any sort of written agreement
concerning the QSA or the Accord. However this doesn't mean that it doesn't
exist. Just that prior Voice of the Corps individuals didn't maintain a
hardcopy. I read everything in the file cabinet as tedious and as time-consuming
as it was. Still its important. So yeah would likewise be curious about the
prior agreement."

not."

faster than an exploration scout."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our
scout is a much better ship for that class I'd think."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "All I have to say is blame
Rogue."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You could put
a plant on it to get it close to the speed, but yeah I agree with Lily on this
one. Our long-ranged scout is pretty sweet."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Why Rogue?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "You might find out and you'll
want to blame someone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you don't
think it's armed enough, then you can get it augmented over at emerging
technologies to give it six turrets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our
Scout is also faster."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'll blame you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is it? I'm
just going by the max cruising speed numbers in Ather's book."

it is not the Combat scout, our Exploration scout."

cruising speed bonus is listed for it."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is it Lily?

the armaments I care about, Eli."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No
it's not go look at the Status report."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's just the
max cruising speed."

kitten?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though having at
least one gun is handy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Otherwise the
void piercer would be a no brainer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might still
get one just for bubbling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll go look,
but I'm fairly certain Ijust checked this the other day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "The
Void Piercer is faster but not that much faster and it has no weapons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but I
think I could deal with the no weapon problem fairly easily out at the bubble."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Normally I
would gree, but the problem is that if pirates drop interdictors at the temp
station, you are stuck."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true,
but I don't actually use my scout to fly to and from."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I keep it parked
at the beacon. If hostile ships are present, I switch to a bastille."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What I really
need is for Best to stop being so shortsighted and sell me an Arrow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "For
the Scout it is: Maximum velocity: 29630."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you have
on that thing?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"That's not that far off form the Void Piercer. I sold my Void Piercer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As
in what?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like even
a 10% speed boost would save me tons of time, especially over hundreds of
artifacting runs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well that's not
the scout's base speed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mine doesn't go
that fast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that with a
plant?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
forget which plant this is it may be a sensor and speed plant but it doesn't
increase it that much and what battery are you using and which engine?"

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the

they want to ensure somehow that the AEU doesn't attack them or something?"

You nod to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is what the takaway was."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Well.... thet would be a non-aggression
pact, whereas this discussion was fer gate access, 'less Ah missed somethin'."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I will take some responsibility in that they were
unprepared, as well. There was some miscummincation between me and the Mutuality
liaison. The folks who were sent were given barely a day's notice because of
that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "True but wouldn't there be other
provisions? I really don't even know what the terms of the QSA agreement were."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "So why can't the government issue this
promise? You leave us alone, we'll leave you alone. No attacks without
provication."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.

You nod to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
Eli nods in agreement.
-andrew You are right, but one of their concerns is that if us civilian pilots
were to be allowed through the skims, then the navy would also have access.
You say to Andrew, "You are right, but one of their concerns is that if us
civilian pilots were to be allowed through the skims, then the navy would also
have access."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa asks, "Granted, the Mutuality hesitates to trust
any major planetary government, but what are we going to lose if we issue a
promise of doing what we're already doing?"
Lily nods solumnly.
Constantine Stone says, "I think that tensions have risen since the course
correction that put AEU navy ships in Mutuality space."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Thet's problematic what with all th' pirates
and th' warnin' us not to do nothin'. Y'all had yer own opportunities to
negotiate such a thing in th' intervenin' years as well, if'n y'all recall."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes this is precisely what they were
concerned about."
An unnamed man in a suit says, "Hem. Hem. That is not the topic of this
meeting."
Constantine Stone says, "Well we can negotiate non-aggression betwen the pilot
corps and the Mutuality."
Constantine Stone says, "But I think they're concerned about the AEU navy."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Constantine Stone.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Right, well, movin' on ta why we're here."
Ather turns his gaze to the suited man and asks, "who is this guy, and why is he
at a meeting of civilian pilots?"
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Can anyone at th' meetin' sum up what went
on, what was said, and suchlike?"
Lily says to an unnamed man in a suit, "Yes sir please introduce yourself and
since this is a meeting of confidence, we would appreciate knowing who you are."
An unnamed man in a suit says, "I am merely an observer, please pretend I am not
here."
Constantine says to an unnamed man in a suit, "Do you work in the liaison
office?"
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "It'd be easier to pretend you're not
here if you left, pal!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
An unnamed man in a suit begins writing on the clipboard again.
Constantine says to an unnamed man in a suit, "Or are you here representing the
president?"
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa exclaims, "If someone was here representing the
president, there is no reason he should hesitate in saying so, while offerring
proof. As for the liaison office, their rep is here already!"
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa points at Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
An unnamed man in a suit says to Andrew, "Not that I am telling you how to do
your job, but perhaps you could bring this meeting to order."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Yes, let's focus on th' reason we're here."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa glares.
An unnamed man in a suit writes something else down on the clipboard.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Again this is a confidential meeting and
we'd appreciate your identifying yourself properly sir."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Can somebody tell me what happened at th'
skim gate meetin'?"
Ather keeps his mechanical gaze fixed firmly on the suited man, but sits back in
his chair.
Eli calmly sips from a large mug of hot black coffee with cream and sugar.
Lily gazes out of the window.
-andrew Basically, Lily, Evangeline, and myself showed up to the meeting. We
waited for them to take the lead, but it became clear that we were supposed to
present an offer. When we offered not to attack them, they asked us for proof of
how we could ensure the AEU would not attack them. Then we went back and forth
with them asking us to give them an offer we could uphold and guarantee and a
plan of how we would ensure the agreement would be upheld.
You say to Andrew, "Basically, Lily, Evangeline, and myself showed up to the

Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Might as well just say it. This weirdo
probably already heard everything on comms anyway if he or one of his people
monitor."
Ather turns briefly to nod at shule before fixing his gaze on the suited man
again.
An unnamed man in a suit adds something to the clipboard notes.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to you.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Were ya... were ya not aware this was a

Shule glances over at an unnamed man in a suit suspiciously before turning his
attention back to Andrew.
Lily says to Andrew, "Not really as our current... ahem representative doesn't
communicate very effectively to us."
An unnamed man in a suit glances up at Andrew Lambeth at that remark.
-andrew I was not aware who requested the meeting. Just that a meeting was
called for.
You say to Andrew, "I was not aware who requested the meeting. Just that a
meeting was called for."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs. "She was referring to our Voice, Vernos Daily, not
Mister Lambeth."

Bailey."

th' time?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Right Mr Lambeth has always done well by

Constantine Stone says, "I think he's asking if we ever planned to attack them."
You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Constantine Stone says, "Which of course we didn't."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They did not ask for anything additional
beyond this request."
'oh, no in that case no.
You say, "Oh, no in that case no."
Constantine Stone says, "I think they were so concerned about these assurances
because of the fleet encroaching on their space."

Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "An' Ah can surmise they wasn't interested in
th' medical stuff neither."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They simply responded that they had
sufficient and did not live in huts or something similar to that."
\nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey arches an eyebrow.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "They get all that stuff probably from the
league. I doubt they need any of that stuff."
Andrew nods thoughtfully. "Thet's true. No huts."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They are indeed a proud lot."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey removes a metallic silver touch einrophone from a black
leather phone holster.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth asks, "Was them's th' only offers made? Any
counteroffers from 'em?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey puts a metallic silver touch einrophone in a charcoal gray
leather gadget bag.

Andrew then adds, "Helpful when negotiations are two way though."

You nod to Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'most definitely."
An unnamed man in a suit glances briefly at Andrew Lambeth, then notes something
down on the clipboard.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "It wouldnt have hurt for them to make a suggestions,
but yes, we are the ones requesting access."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They were very annoyed that the aEU didn't
make a showing when the QSA agreement was due."
nod eli
You nod to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth nods.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "It could theoretically also mean that no
matter what we offer they won't return QSA access regardless due to current
tensions."

You nod to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa. "This very well may have been the
case."
Pilot Liaison Andrew Lambeth says, "Oh, Ah reckon there's somethin' you coulda
offered 'em they would take, but probably nothin' wise."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well they probably may provided the aEU
Government will commit to and state that they will not attack under non-hostile
conditions."
Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, my understanding is that this is the only 'offer'
they'll accept."
Constantine Stone says, "Though I wasn't present."

immaterial? What they want is an assurance that the encroachment was a mistake
and won't happen again."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well we almost made it hostile."

You nod to Constantine Stone. "I did."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Tht Flotilla had no business doing wht they
did."
Constantine Stone says, "Does it seems that this is then out of our hands as
civilian pilots? If the government needs to do something interesting on the
border of Mutuality space, that's up to them, and we can't stop them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That Flotilla had no business doing what
they did."
Constantine Stone says, "But if they don't, they're raising tensions for no
reason."
Constantine Stone says, "And should issue such an assurance."
Andrew hurriedly asks, "Is there anythin' else of note thet happened durin' th'
meetin'?"
Constantine Stone says, "In this pilot's opinion, anyhow."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.
An unnamed man in a suit writes more on the clipboard.

Andrew shifts uneasily. "Yes. Of course."
Lily glances about the room with a half glare.

in our civilian capacity."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily and Shule
can weigh in on this, but from what I gathered, the Mutuality really wants an
assurance that the encroachment was a mistake and a guarantee that it won't
happen again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got the
distinct impression that the AEU plans to make neither."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident

Lambeth said he didn't think further negotiations would be a good idea for the

Evangeline, I'm not sure the meeting was soely to do with your letter, they

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, it's good
to get some levity on the channel."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like
spirits have been low since the meeting with Lambeth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Alright, my felo are trying to squeeze as many of themselves as
possible into a pod chair."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Well I wasn't there, so I am afraid if I had been I would have been
a low point in your spirit too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, you missed
nothing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I got the
impression that Lambeth was forced to meet us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Well if he didn't want to meet us, he shouldn't have been forced to
do so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Of course if he was being interviewed or investigated..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed, I'm
thinking maybe this is a sign of changes coming to the liaison office."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And the way it
operates in general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Great... Just great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I mean we have already had huge changes coming to the AEU, why not
make one more huge one?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I forgot to be sarcastic."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "There we go, sarcasm accomplished."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Sorry I was doing something, I was trying to figure out what debris
was what."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No worries."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just one more
medium IFS wreck..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't worry
folks, I'm sure this will all be over soon enough, for better or worse."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "It's ok, I'm having fun..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That negative
213% on our progress surely did not go unnoticed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's
what I've been thinking."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Well at least we can salvage without it being an issue."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I mean do those missions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Goddess it was hard to put in the coordinates into the console there
for a moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I do love my mighty two grappel, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A great
grapple."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yeah I like it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "But I hate rat's nests with a passion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh really? I've
always liked doing those."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "As soon as I see all the good debris in a sector I know the rats are
responsible."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "No, it's not that I hate... I haven't done of those in a long time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know right?
You hit the debris scanner and as you read down the list and thinkg "Oh, wow
there's so much really good chunks in here.. wow.. thre's so many.. wait.. too
many...." then you check for ships and say "Oh shit!""
Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from
the north.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yeah, exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You know, I hate to
be that guy, but I've suddenly had something come to thought."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Morris gave me some of my felo back, the one's with the mind reading
capabilities? I think he did, though I've not seen any read each other's mind
yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "No... Oh no. What?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What are you
thinking?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "What with the
strike on industry, there's likely to be a lot of scrap and debris floating
about. Which means RATS."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh that's cool.
Evenia just gave me a feathered one to keep as a pet. He's great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, that's
true."

fit in my hold."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Guess we'll have
to try and step up nest cleanings."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aww, sorry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
"It's all right."
Mischief the large black felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's
leg with a quiet "Mrrp."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "It matters where you transfer your debris for salvage missions,
doesn't it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I thought it did."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think it
does, I always transfer at belt of orion."

go throguh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Through."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Point."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not really,
you can do it it at the temp station, or Accord command."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Oh, well I always do mine at accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's faster
that way, really."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "... Eli, what are you implying?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Do you think felo just slide out of their nests?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The solider
is doing great, he's got a little horned helmet and marches around my ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er the
soldier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

do?"

didn't know they could lick you? Hmm."

while you sleep."

joking around aisling. Eve started the saying."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It is
missions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident sighs.
"You know."
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Materials is materials."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Accord missions aren't part
of the strike, as I understand it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, I didn't make the
rules."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
and these are accord missions."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well. I certainly didn't
either. So I could be completely backwards wrong."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Here we go, we're going back."
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Well, suppose is none of
my business anyways. You do you."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I think that's the
right rationale. Apparently all the materials from accord missions go straight
to the accord."

transmits, "I had to do something or go nuts."

transmits, "I am still transfering over to the accord though."

money for economy of AEU."

your alliances for the income you receive, no?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I said, I didn't
design the strike, but my understanding is that none of the credit income is
taxable by the AEU."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli would know, though."

transmits, "He's the one who said we could do them."

[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "And bonk, Aisling, bonk."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Bonk."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And I could be completely
wrong. I'm certainly not AEU, or part of the strike. I'm just going on my
understanding."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I'm not even going to try to argue with them. I'm honestly just
doing what I was told I could do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm not
really worried about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Even if the
money is going to the AEU, honestly, I don't know that they are really being
affected much by this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess time
will tell."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I don't think so, not unless we did like, a ton of missions."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can't imagine forcing
myself not to salvage though, so I respect your efforts. I'd probably go half
nuts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like for
instance I don't think SHule and Ather salvaged a lot anyway."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You enjoy salvaging?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It would be a very
poor Alliance if it relied purely on the Civ Corp."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know Eli did
some, but I feel like this might not have reduced income levels much."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yeah, well I don't either, but since my only options are
exploration, which I love by the way, or salvage missions, or beacons? I'm
good."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Fanatically so, yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true,
Dakhal."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Then there's no way you have any
room to go nuts."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "The strike is
really just a thorn in the side, but that's the point."
[General Communication] Emily Ford giggles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, there's
plenty of other stuff to do."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I swear, everyone says
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been able
to work on exploration really hard."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So that's
something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do wish I knew
if we could do Tesla."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I know, I would actually do tesla."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wrote the EAOS
liaison, but we don't know what resources from Tesla go to the AEU."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I miss it,
especially because it can be hard to get a nest crew."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "True."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "But like I said before, I miss scooping."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could really
go for a scoop or two."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Buuuuut, we can't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Uuugh, I need to like, compelte that third mission but I can't, ooh
but I have 20 million extra AEU credits now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I had been going
after my lock evasions for a long time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I feel like
for the past month it has been really tough to even get a destroyer beacon
going."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I don't know. I haven't been doing many lock evassions, though I
suppose I need to now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So what do I
need a clipper for?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A cruiser for, I
mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Well... I don't even have a clipper, so I get what you're saying to
some extent, though not really. We haven't really been doing that many beacons
as it stands anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Maybe this would be a good time to start."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "It gives us combat, but not a whole lot of industry. I don't think
so at least."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do beacons give
industry?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Not sure."

exploration sensors."

doesn't have."

talking about?"

as usual."

something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess I
misunderstood how it works?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought we
knew that accord salvage gave no resources or money to the union?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, they're
no ttaxable, so the alliance gets no money out of it. I would assume that they
would eventually get resources, but that those resources would then be
distributed later through the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So you
wouldn't really be giving them to the allilance, but to get them, they'd have to
get them throu the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that was
my understand."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Understanding."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone coughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Of course,
like you said. It's possible that it's just spin. I notice they didn't say what
kind of work you did."

you broke the strike, but yet doesn't say something like Future Voice does work
for Accord."

I can find out."

one who has done accord salvage?"

and Shule definitely haven't."

than that then."

they're not sure of their position and want a hypercast to get a heading."

level somethin."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Definitley. H7 all the way."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why they were askin for
news the other day. Not so they could hear the news, but 'cause they knew we'd
have to hypercast at 'em to do it and get a headin."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Someone did hypercast at them
though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I did."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Never got an exact headin
'cause I got a late start. Got busy with somethin and couldn't get to the Torus

strong coffee."

[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "That's how it usually goes, Eli."

said though? I'm just asking because both of the trips I was on recently both
asked the same question and were not lost?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No it didn't. They asked bout
a hypercaster, not a beacon."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "You asked the beacon chain."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I gotcha."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Correct, we did ask about the
chain, just for convenience."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hypercaster's used for findin
where they are. Beacon ya gotta know where ya are to need one up pretty much."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hence why I'm askin if they're
lost. 'Cause if they are, somebody might wanna give 'em a hand with a station
and find 'em."

breakfast. Sorry Colton."

double-check which hypercaster top, but I think the Ultra."

no doubt."

think it's 2500 exploration and 2000 command."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I ain't quite sure. We ain't
got firm numbers on them tops. That's why I said increase it from 25."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, we ain't quite sure bout
their headin, so it's gonna take some playin round with the direction."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's what I'm trying this
very second."

hand or a break, just holler."

don't feel like doing much else, so all good, and thanks for the help."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure thing."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "If they were heading back from
Tom Town, they probably did start heading down some, so 60 might be a bit too
high of an elevation."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Last I knew, she gave me 70."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So that already was goin down
some from that. But their plan was also to head southeast outta tom town,
possibly up too. So I ain't sure where they are exactly."

garbled but understandable, H4 is too garbled."

[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Perhaps try power fifty?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's where I am."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Just going through different
headings."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Try swinging the hypercaster in
five degree increments, and hypercast the numbers your pointing at each time you
shift it."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Are the calibrations more help
to them?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's only gotta go 50
light-years. And that top can go quite a bit further than that, just not sure
how far. Just member the higher the power, the closer on the right headin ya
gotta be. It's like a water spigot. Put your finger over part of it and it hits
less stuff but comes out stronger."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not yet."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I mean you could use 'em...but
they won't be able to respond with their hypercaster till they're right up on
ya."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "By that time they'll be well
within comms range."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'd be tempted to try an
elevation of fifty, then swing it from 270 to 360 in five degree increments."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. That and try higher."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Clearest I got 'em tuesday was
at 70 or 75."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Three days ago? They're probably
quite a bit lower elevation now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They'da had to go straight
down to get lower elevation."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What's the highest ya went up
for power?"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's possible they swung too far
rimward, you could try swinging it around from 300 down to 250."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "50, these things go at least
as far as Hall of Pain, so it really shouldn't be more than that."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It is possible, yeah."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also possible they're nearly
directly above us, or even down some. With the lack of crew coverage they've

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Change Johann's hypercast
slot?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I did, but then I put it back
as soon as I heard it start."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Temp hypercaster."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ah."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What'd the elevation end up
bein Ted?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "30."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'd maybe try five degrees either
side and wait for a reply."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wow. They musta hit a good
storm pushed 'em down then."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah, it was totally clear
Emily."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'd leave it go. They said
h2."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "She's got a headin now, and
they're only 50 light-years out."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Mess with their heads."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Can't hurt to send them a few
calibrations now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It wouldn't."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "They probably went too far
up."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Uh, not far enough rather."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, anyone can come back
here if they need more."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Tell them you're a relative of
Famous Pete, and that you're somewhere far Spinward. Tell them to turn around
and set a heading of 234.56 with an elevation of 78."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They shouldn't. If they're as
close as she said with the NDB, they've got all they need."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "78.90. please complete the set."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "In theory, Nicolette ought to
be able to figure it from there."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Fine, just mess with their heads
and be done with it."
[General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Perla
Marion."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "In fact, they've done pretty
much exactly what happened to me when I was trying to line us up in Goss's
carrier that time."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They were comin from
southsoutheast and up. So they've gone pretty far west and down in a couple
days."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Thought they were further east
than they were."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Actually, up and
southsoutheast."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not if you got 'em at 250."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They were closer on 300."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, they thought they wre
further east, so went more west than they needed."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Either that or hit a storm."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Glad I suggested you try knocking
it over rimward a bit, that could have been a wild duck hunt."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I am too, I wasn't far from
looking over there anyway, because I remembered it happening to me."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Over-compensating for not having
a chart, perhaps."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Charters are bloody convenient
to have, and helpful, but the skill of lining up on the NDB is something we
should keep up."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I agree."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Absolutely."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If the person who can read the
chart's in bed, you can at least get it goin good."

[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Shouldn't be long before they
hit the chain either."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. When they told us their
NDB's a couple hours ago, they were 83 on the standard."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "270 is."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Is it called 270?"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "They broke it."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's called something
different, but you can still find them if you look."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "When you put up that
hypercaster it was waypoint X-somethin-or-other."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, I noticed that."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "So they put up a station
and didn't finish."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Rather brilliant."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looked like they put up 2,
Mel. And 270 after it went down but 271 fore it went down."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Then just let the rest be."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Basically wasted two
stations."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Pretty much."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If there were hostiles there
you'd be quite happy for their presence."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "How's it going, Pierre?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "There, see Emily? I can say
somethin more than yep now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Iknow the thing with
constantine last night, was that I had told some of them itwas ok to do Accord
salvage missions. This is because they are bringing in things for research by
the Accord and not bringing in resources for the alliance. But I'm guessing that
I'm wrong about that."
[General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Can someone remind me what I ned
totr gen Can someone remind me what button or command I need to tell the
computer to jump back to chet? I forget the name of the sector of speace its
in."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Even though,  that's
clearly what an Accord mission is."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's in Chetumal orbit."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Not to be confused with Chet's
bar and grill."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I'm not sure about
this whole "most pilots contributing normally" business is about."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, when you've got folks
roid haulin, doin nests, and whatever...it may not bring in physical resources
for the alliance, but it allows 'em to buy whatever they need."
[General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Thanks."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Same with Accord missions."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Accord missions are not
taxable."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Have you chatted with the cadet
orientation officer on Chetumal?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't what we dump at stations
taxable, just not as high taxes?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Our progress goals were
down -213% That's hardly folks doing business as usual."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Excellent work."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also RATS nest are not
an industrial activitiy, so that headline is not about that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wonder how it stacked up to
more than the one conquest period previous."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I ain't talkin bout just the
headline Eli."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Iknow you are talking
strictly about points and credits."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm talkin bout what the AEU
government gets, period."
[Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So who's down for beacons?"
[Tactical Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "I am."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The only people I nkow
of that have been hauling, are folks who are not participating int he strike."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Which are newer folks,
like Dakhal."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually, I'm fairly
certain he's the one who has been doing any resource work at all."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "It is thought
that counts."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Have folks that don't normally
do much industry as it is done anything to get attention?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Long story short, the news will
use whatever it can to further it's agenda. I thought this was already something
we all knew."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, I plan on finding
out more about the Accord missions today. What I had found out before is that
they are not taxable by the government, and according to the source, they
actually lose the alliance money as they are for the Accord, this headline has
gotta be about something else."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Perhaps you have a striker who's
covertly working."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sure to a point but the
alliances must still be getting something."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The income you make is probably
taxed, even if they don't get the debris itself."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If ya want 'em to stand up and
take notice, sometimes ya gotta do things that ain't comfortable. Picket, stop
workin altogether. I'm sure the Accord'd understand."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what I'm saying,
the Union said that they are not taxable."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wonder if the Union's tellin
ya somethin a bit self-servin..."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Credits are credits. They can
be taxed."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm sure they could find a way
if they wanted to."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Ask the Accord if you're in
doubt."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Honestly that don't make no
sense. If I salvage comaprable debris, I'm gonna make the same amount of credits
whether it's for missions or whatever. So it's gotta be taxed."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But yeah, if you really want to
be taken seriously, just stop doing everything completely. No nothing at all.
Only defend your home sectors if they get attacked by outsiders or IFS."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Don't even bother fighting off
pirates."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Unless they attack you or
something."
[General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "What's a good place to do
asteroid mining?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's one of the many
reasons why they want to leave the Accord, and any resources they get would have
to come through the Accord. So if they wish to continue getting those, gotta
stay I the Accord."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Zackery, I sent ya a book. The
best location for the Fringe is listed in there."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I guess I'm gonna
have to bother Shea once again."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't member it off the top
of my head."
[General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Ah, thanks."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Any asteroid hauling station,
Zackery. Barnham's belt, for example."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Thanks."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "And as I said, talk to the cadet
orientation officer too."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I don't think you guys have a
one best place."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They do."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They do?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I was under the impression that
it was all the same for everyone except for Crias which is only accessible by
us."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well then."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh and Zackery, if you're still
interested in beacons, we're in the old earth lounge."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Looks like they only have one
alliance station though. Barnham's Belt. If they mine elsewhere, they get taxed
out their rear ends."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh I see."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "We've got three cause we're
awesome."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or is it four."
[General Communication] Zackery Za transmits, "Beacons sound good, on my way."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We've got three, AEU and
Mutuality have two, EAOS and Fringe have 1."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm also wondering if
this had something to do with transferring to the temp station. I believe Eva
did an Accord mission yesterday and there was no prbolem, but then constantine
did one last night using the temp station and and it was seen as breaking from
the strike."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whereas Eva transfered
hers directly to the Accord."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "90 percent sure we get the
physical debris from those stations. Because the cores are league."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno. Stations pay a bit
more 'cause their taxed slightly less. I'm pretty sure you get taxed takin it to
Accord based on interalliance tax law or somethin."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure it'
distributed on some level, but again that all goes through the Accord."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm actually wondering
if it's what Emily said. Someone working anyways, and saying they're not.
Sometimes folks have a funny idea of what exactly things mean."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Always about
the taxes."

is about the only way I can do that."

have no idea. I haven't been available for awhile so it sure hasn't been me
doing work."

down a ton on our progress goals, so folks aren't doing much for sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
I turned in belt points because I had no information concerning the details of

in belt points but nothing since. Shule nor anyone provided me with anything."
