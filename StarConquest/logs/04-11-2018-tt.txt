-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth
rug, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a white four poster rattan bed.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Molly Grant
She appears to be 23 years old. She is about five feet and seven inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is athletic with muscled hips and strong calves. She has
broad shoulders and very small breasts. Her face is square, lightly-freckled,
and unblemished, with a straight nose and strong chin. Her lips are full and
light pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of cosmetically perfect teeth.
Beneath a set of lightly-colored eyebrows, her eyes are grey and round. Her
shoulder-length, straight hair is blonde and drawn back in a ponytail. She has
oval light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a faded black leather bomber jacket, a long-sleeved brown
fatigue shirt, a pair of loose-fitting brown fatigue pants, and a pair of supple
black flight boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a neon green metachannel FTL
communicator, and a brownish bronze canvas gear bag. Her head, face, both eyes,
neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

system. Though, saying that, it doesn't appear quite large enough for a

the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!

here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

Constantine Stone says, "I assume the navy cleared it."
Constantine Stone takes a sip of a bottle of sparkling water flavored with
natural tangerine juice.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Thanks as I didn't
hear when it cleared."
Constantine Stone says, "So far from the turtle suit."
Constantine Stone says, "Assuming I can get it at all."
The aerial fortress suddenly fires its ascent thrusters, rocketing toward open
space.
Evenia Callseah hugs Constantine Stone. "You'll get there."
Lily Kaise emerges from the lift.
Constantine Stone says, "Weird that you need more points to do the mission than
you do to get a tier 5 suit."
Constantine Stone chuckles.
A quiet beep serves to notify you that the aerial fortress has completed repairs
of all stored equipment.
Lily Kaise says, "Well I didn't kill anybody."
The vibrations of ascent start to ease off slightly as the aerial fortress moves
into open space.
Evenia Callseah grins and nods.
Lily Kaise laughs.

That way is currently blocked for your safety.
Evenia Callseah says, "Nope."
Constantine Stone asks, "How does it work for the Accord, they can do it at any
time, but the mission is just painfully long?"
Evenia Callseah says, "It's a fun suit to tank in."

That way is currently blocked for your safety.
Lily Kaise says, "I just wish I had a little more to attract."

Lily Kaise glides in from the south.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that
bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Thanks all!"
Constantine Stone walks in from the south.
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,

A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the

one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in

the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

 You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans,
and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of
white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain,
a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in
a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer.
You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black
flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large
expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a
golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black

Though New Phoenix's heavy industry still lies mostly in ruins, a few new
warehouses are being built along this section of Soviet Trail, part of the long,
slow recovery process. The north end of the street is blocked by high concrete

New Phoenix's heavy industry was especially hard hit by the bombardment of the
city. Several years ago, factories, research facilities, and industrial parks
populated the area north of here, but it is now closed to the public, and large
signs mounted to high concrete barriers stretching across the north end of the
street warn of various types of deadly hazards. Still, rebuilding is taking
place, evident in the construction of several large warehouses nearby. Among
them is a shiny new store, an elegant sign near the door reading, 'Blazing
Trails.'

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 920" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going,
Casen?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Well enough, thank
you. I have merely been salvaging and listening to the general chatter, so it
has been quiet. And you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah yes, the
general chatter. Well don't take everything they say to heart. I know things
look bad for us here, but it's not like they say."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We tried to do a
lot of things to change our predicament."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Incidentally we
failed repeatedly, and a lot of people like to think that if they were in our
shoes they would have come out on top easily."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Not to worry. I found
most of the criticisms to be rather naive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if we
could put in a bid on something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess probably
not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather had said
once that the corps is worth trillions of credits, but I wonder how much the
individual operations are worth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I bet
exploration could be bought for a song."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Comparitively, I
mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Yes, I suspect that is
the least-valuable of the bids. But I suspect the corporations putting in bids
are willing to put forth sums beyond our capital. I could be wrong, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you're
probably right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "If we had the amount
of money required to place bids, I think that would mean the government itself
would have enough not to entertain the idea of privatization."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's
true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are we the
poorest alliance government?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess we must
be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I believe so, as
jarring as that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's not really
shocking, we basically have the worst stuff."

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving
power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier
Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a

it, and the light clicks off.

midway recharge station or stations, we'll have greater limitations on how far
we can travel."

You nod to Lily Kaise.
"Yeah, I am curious about that eAOS cruiser." Lily Kaise nods. "Before Pierre

alliances."
Lily Kaise says, "But they do have other tech so."
nod
You nod.
Constantine Stone asks, "Couldn't he have rented an AEU cruiser through
invaders?"
Lily Kaise says, "Like the Stealth for the Galleon and other tech which I don't
know much about."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh yeah, I've seen him mention that."
Constantine Stone asks, "What does the stealth do?"
Lily Kaise says, "I think it is like a cloak which may mask the signature of a
starship."
Constantine Stone asks, "Is that the cloaking that that one tracking array can
see through?"
Lily Kaise nods.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its
yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Constantine Stone says, "I've still never progressed to using deep borers and
improved processors."
Constantine Stone says, "I would also have to get the next tier of transmission
tower."
'I use them all the time.
You say, "I use them all the time."
Constantine Stone says, "And build at least 8 more drones."
Constantine Stone says, "It seems like a hefty investment."
'Nah, it helps.
You say, "Nah, it helps."
Constantine Stone says, "But, my sites take 4 hours, so I guess it would make it
faster."
Constantine Stone laughs.
Lily Kaise says, "I use enhanced processors only after just one Basic and 36
drones and up through the third tier everything but I don't go beyond the Deep
Borer for drillers."
'Mine take that long and I use bores and such.
You say, "Mine take that long and I use bores and such."
Constantine Stone says, "You probably have way more metals than I do though, I
imagine."
Constantine Stone asks, "You get more and more as you get more industry, right?"
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I have about 51k for Rocky and 60k to 61k for metal rich
and so on."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh wow, that's twice as much as I get."
Lily Kaise says, "But I've been using this configuration for a long long time."
Lily Kaise says, "Let's see."
Lily Kaise removes a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser from a lavender silk
backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.
Lily Kaise examines a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

-constantine Sometimes, I can't spread out in one direction as much as I'd like
so yeah.
You say to Constantine, "Sometimes, I can't spread out in one direction as much
as I'd like so yeah."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh I see."
Lily Kaise says, "]I don't correct for the placement of the central Coordinator.
It's never that far off so I just pretty much stay with this arrangement but the
rule of thumb, if you want to be a perfectionist is to place the first tier of
weapons 2 away form the coordinator as well as the processors."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Constantine Stone says, "Hm, interesting."
Constantine Stone says, "So I find that the number of metals I lose to poachers
varies really widely."
Constantine Stone says, "Some sites it will be a few hundred, sometimes well
over 1000."
Constantine Stone says, "I guess my turret placement is probably bad."
'I almost never lose more than 100
You say, "I almost never lose more than 100."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh, wow."
'Unless I'm just not paying attention.
You say, "Unless I'm just not paying attention."

Constantine Stone asks, "To keep it under 100, do you have to micromanage the
site during poacher raids?"
'Sometimes.
You say, "Sometimes."
Constantine Stone says, "I basically never look at the site again after I finish
setup."
Constantine Stone says, "Okay."
'I usually stop operations and let them help defend.
You say, "I usually stop operations and let them help defend."
'But that's just me.
You say, "But that's just me."
Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I can see both ways."
Constantine Stone says, "If you want to maximize that's definitely the best way
to do it."
Constantine Stone says, "Sometimes I just like to let it run while I stare at
the wall though."

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking
bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an
individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly
seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and
hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very
well built and maintained station.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

New Announcements:
-----
In an attempt to fix minor inconsistencies, several help files have been
changed.  HELP LEAGUE POLITICS, HELP AEU POLITICS, and HELP FRINGE POLITICS have
all been edited slightly, with HELP LEAGUE PARTIES, HELP AEU PARTIES, and HELP
FRINGE PARTIES adding back a list of the various political entities in those
alliances.  HELP ALLIANCE GOVERNMENTS has been removed, and in its place are
HELP LEAGUE GOVERNMENT, HELP AEU GOVERNMENT, HELP FRINGE GOVERNMENT, HELP EAOS
GOVERNMENT, and HELP MUTUALITY GOVERNMENT.  If anything still remains
inconsistent, appears missing, or does not make sense relating to alliance
governments, political parties, or the various forms of parliament, please let
us know.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We don't need an

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus, honestly,
it was funny when Isaac was absent through an entire term the first time, and
every successive time it gets more and more funny."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The industrial whip
only tends to send comm notices that we generally only pretend to read anyways."
Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Anyways, hopefully my
office holding days will soon be done too. Especially when I send my
rudely-worded letter to those piles of shit who think they're going to try to
control the civilian pilot program with their retarded corporations."

agree."

should say."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Require that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You don't actually
have to be there for the entire transfer process, either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Ah, perfect. So now
that I've begun the procedure I can just head off and it will automate the
