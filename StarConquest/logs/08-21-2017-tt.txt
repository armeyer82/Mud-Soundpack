Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green
leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
/yyq%cwa;7H0H"f?PZyi;+x,1Jc3G4``S|1iUb{b
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "About forks? I
should hope so."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I'd bet about half the people
around know what we're talking about, and the rest have no idea."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't even
know if half do."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs. "I mean about this particular
fork."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "It is a mighty fork."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The mightiest?"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The mightiest."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm. Keegan,
maybe you, me, Nissi, possibly Eli and Johann know about the true power of the
fork. Melinda might've as well. She might've seen it in action."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Possibly
Morris? Who can know!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No clue what y'all're even
talkin bout."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're talking about
your dinner forks, right?"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alas."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd love to hear the story
though."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The mystical
powers of the fork are better demonstrated."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or are you talking
about that wicked looking fork of doom."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Sadly I think I missed the
fork."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That ain't xactly possible at
the moment Ather."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow, that's
disappointing! You were totally around when Joss was, Johann!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm riftin south of Campeche
bout 2 light-years out."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I remember the fork."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You and Brynn."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I was."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wasn't round when this Joss
person was."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I only been here 15 months."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would've been
utterly shocked speechless if you didn't remember the fork, Nissi."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Seems like more and
more pilots are being riled about the situation with the government. Just saw to
pilots going at it in the lounge."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The fork has
been used in recent times, Morris. I just thought you might've seen it used is
all. Not Joss using it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Two pilots, even."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am now intrigued about the
fork."

received 404,850.03 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Progress. Honestly, I'd rather see devisiveness over doing nothing at all and
letting outcord actually happen."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We all are."
[General Communication] Prichard Grant transmits, "Is it more like a pitchfork
or trident? A weapon of sorts?"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is a fork!"
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not a
pitchfork."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe it's like a fork in the
road."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "What."
[General Communication] "I dunno!" Morris Corlew laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Idealy, I'd like to see more and more pilots join in a full strike."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Honestly, one big
reason why I didn't strike is because I already put a lot into this conquest and
I prefer to finish what I start."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The
whole point of a strike like this is to ensure purposely, yes, purposely that
the alliance does not meet its goals."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, you won't see me
contribute for the next conquest, at least."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "We're
supposed to be doing our best to disrupt the flow of resources and credits into
the alliance so that they will reconsider outcord. Once that's done, we can get
back to working in full capacity again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Dakhal Does sort of
have a point on one thing though, we're not the biggest part of the
infrastructure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Remember, don't even volunteer for beacon drops, any ground activities,
or...well, do just about anything else short of fighting in an invasion!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But
we contribute sizeable amounts to it. One thing we all should be doing more, and
I totally would if I had the time, is float over new earth, and encourage
merchants to deliver their trade cargo elsewhere, and to not buy any exports
from New earth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do
that, continue with the strike, and you'll definitely put a nice dent in the
infrastructure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes,
it's true that merchants travel to more than just New Earth in the Union, but
you need to consider that New Earth is the capital. Encourage merchants to turn
away from the capital and you might actually encourage them to turn away from
the entire union until the government stops outcord negotiations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I will begin
to do this myself in just a couple of hours. I hope everyone who wants to will
join me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its true. Trade is the
life blood of any economy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
all also need to consider something else, too. If in the end we are such a small
part of the infrastructure, why are we banned from visiting a majority of AEU
holdings? We have a bigger impact on the alliance's infrastructure than
President Best is willing to admit to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Stand
firm when you're doing this. Even if he sends the navy after you, don't back
down. Don't fire first, heck, don't fire at all. I repeat, do not fire any shot
at our loyal naval crews. This is not their fault, or their fight. If they end
up destroying your ships, it will look worst for the President. They're just
following orders, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "A fair point, I mean,
we're banned from a lot of places becuase a presence of how much wealth we can
earn."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Precisely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't
let the propeganda machine make you believe that you have a smaller impact than
you really do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Stand
firm, stand strong and most importantly of all, stand united. The more people we
have united in this strike the better."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ather, I know your
focused on the strike but we need to d o some looking into the privitization of
our corps. Like I said. It could mean Best himself might have tighter control
over who can and cant be a pilot amoungst us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One
thing at a time, Tara. I agree about privatization. I fucking hate the
possibility that it could happen to us. However, right now, we need to keep
laser focus on the outcord situation. If that fails, then pretty much nothing
Best does will matter anymore, including privatizing the corps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The
privatisastion issue was only recently announced, we have time for that. But
we're creeping up on the end of the Outccord negotiations right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "He
suggested that as a distraction to shift our focus. We need to not let it make
us lose our focus though. We have to concentrate all of our efforts on doing
what we can to ensure that the Union stays in the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Agreed, I
think the strike shoudl continue until the negotiations are stopped and the
government agrees wot work with the opposition to come up with a different
solution than leaveing the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're
trying to shut out any disagreement at all, they will do the same with
privatisation. That's the wall we need to break through."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Anyway, I must dash! If you guys really are going to do the merchant thing, I
wish you the best of luck! I hope to help with that hopefully in the coming
week."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We have to
show them that shutting us all out isn't so easy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I will be
later Ather, even if it just ends up being me."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid
service robot, and Shine the big white glowing felo here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider
chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid
service robot, a small Bari-shaped tidbit, and Shine the big white glowing felo
here.

Minor Change:
A few ground combat changes:
- Spinward suits no longer get gravitics. This made them somewhat too powerful
and took away from the Fringe suit's unique flavour.
- Spinward suits now get blades instead, which are more comparable in damage to
projectiles and rely on swift strikes. Rules of nature!

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

777 I went hundreds of sectors and came home with 8."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the
one-person cargo hauler "Compaq". The organization has earned 102,500.69
credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You have
to kind of get a feel for how many you typically find in a trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "When I
was starting out it made sense to quit after 8-10."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Now I
can pull about 30 from a search of 1000 sectors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of
course, that can take a very long time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So keep
those engines upgraded!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hard to get those
engine upgrades without doing beacons, and I expect beacons will be rare soon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What
makes you say that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, at least
beacons done by our own alliance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You may
be right, but I wouldn't count us out just yet. There are only about 4 people
actively striking, and I know Shule will still do beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Really
only Ather has said he won't do beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I will be striking for
this conquest. I'm just gathering artifacts for my own fun. Not turning them
in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Also
Tara, if it lifts your spirits, I usually average an artifact every 30-50
sectors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Depending on how long I've been searching."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So don't
let it get you down if you go a while without seeing any."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They'll
turn up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Once I
found 30 searching only 770. I think that was my best day ever, but I'd have to
examine all my old notes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Earlier today someone
turned in a hundred artifacts at once from the bubble. Apparently they made a
billion credits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
that sounds about right. I turned in 62 a while back and got over 700,000,000."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll be happy when
I have better engines."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll
get 'em."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Pretty tempted to
have vulcans on the next combat ship I purchase."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How
come?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I like vulcans."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah,
well, you gotta go with what you like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Depending on the ship though, you might be leaving some damage potential
behind. A lot of our ships make better use of lasers than most."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Aye, I'll be sure
to watch for that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Could put them on your
fighter, I mean I don't think the fighters that even cadets can get have systems
that improve the effectiveness of lasers, do they?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nope."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Careful, I might
take that suggestion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Are any
of the fighters unique to the AEU? Can anyone purchase the Hyperion fighters?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
that chains do make some sense on a fighter due to its smaller grid, but I like
lasers since I favor torpedoes on them. Minicannons are a bit grid hungry for
fighters, and I don't like having both weapons rely on ammo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Chains
might make a lot of sense on the 6-turret fighters, since those are really light
on grid, but I've never experimented with that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I'd be
happier to use those fighters if they had a warp drive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "First artifact!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed,
I keep a bastille for when I go artifacting and to try harder beacons, but I
still like my cadet fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I imagine that
heavy fighter is pretty great with vulcans loaded up on it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It even has a
pretty great cargo hold, it's like it had that in mind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
the hold's good for its two launchers as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Someone said I could
find books in the liaison offices? Where at exactly?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They're
in the voice's office."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "To my
knowledge there's only one book in the box currently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But
you're welcome to a copy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Okinaj Sei transmits, "Ah, ok. Guess I'll go
hunting for a ship guide."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
voice's office is the first door on the left."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah,
you should be able to to grab those at the bookstore in the spaceport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The box
only has Morris's industry book."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is
also a great read."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Number two."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone cheers.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Some sort of weird
bubble thing. I think I found one of these on the expedition."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
first artifact I ever found was a Jinu plasma bubble."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wait, that's plasma?!
how come we can safely touch it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That I
don't know. It must be contained within some field, I'd imagine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
considered keeping my first find, but it looked slightly degraded, and I was
worried it might be dangerous to carry around New Earth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "My first find was a
Fringe torpedo. I had the distinct feeling that I didn't want to keep it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Artifacts like that
just stress to me how much we need to make contact with the Jinu again.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Some.. sort of sensor
device? it looks old."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Lot of
old alliance tech out in that field."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "This thing must be
pre-subjugation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
yeah. What is 777, the resting place of the New Earth 40th? Or 44th?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "40th."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
that fleet was wrecked in a pre-subjugation battle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Must have been a
massive fleet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It was.
I went and visited the graveyard of the Telexan 134th some time ago, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We've
lost a lot of ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh! I think the ship I
was on in the expedition passed the 134th on the way home."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "To float in this
sector and sleep, or to turn back. Hm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I have
slept out in uncharted space many times. I don't know that I can really
recommend it, as it is inherently risky."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But you
might be okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey
Eli!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Guys the
headlines, I really do think we need to go full strike on this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I
had been waiting to talk to you about it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But
that's all I need to hear."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm all
in, obviously."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I only didn't strike
last conquest beucase I had already done stuff and I prefer to finish what I
start, Eli."

reviewed the voice terminal notes and the status of accord missions were not
really clear to me from them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wrote
to someone at the accord for clarification, just out of curiosity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But as I
told Ather, I don't need to salvage to eat, so it really doesn't matter to me."

mind coming to the bridge?"

that is beautiful."

prefer to finish what I start and pulling out half way when I've already worked
enough didn't seem right, for last conquest."

just wanted to make sure you knew it wasn't just an inudstry strike anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er an

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
that sounds useful."

when there's like a spreader jumping around and such."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Could you
hear that, constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I read
you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good old
omnidirectional capsule caster."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How were
you doing that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just in
general or making it omnidirectional."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "In
general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh it's the
Hypercaster upgrade, it should be in the book if you have a copy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pretty sure
it's a Farport upgrade. You can send messages very far. It normally has to be
given a headig like the rift drive, but the capsule only has a shorter ranged
one that casts in every direction."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Got that
one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Gotta be
careful though. Ships that you don't intend to pick up your cast can still pick
them up and use the to hone in on your location."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How do
you trace a ping?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well you
can't really trace it exactly, but I'm sure you noticed that it gave a general
direction of where it came from."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay, so they could just start heading that way until they found you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pretty much,
yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Any other time
and it would be busy busy busy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
I'm amazed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Have you
seen any more activity?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not a peep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh,
weird."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've only got
it tuned to the allinace right now, I'm sure they're jumping around in other
places."

good. Try to get others to join you when you do."

do."

food somewhere."

they smelled us coming."

is just not the busy part of the day."

really says a lot in very few words."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So
should we think about setting up message beacons in the three hub sectors?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or will
the message potentially not fire quickly enough to catch a ship in the middle of
a jump sequence."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think
they fire unless they detect that the ship is not jumping again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's not
going to be there long enough, I don't think they work, let me test that real
quick though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Now that's
interesting, the forecast actually went off before I jumped out, so that might
actually work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It might
be worth a shot. I'm sure they will be taken down, but it will certainly make
the news."

might be comfortable."

maybe set them up."

and deploy the first round."

find out right now if the message beacons will still go off."

think so. I don't think traders make their way to the frontier cluster ever, do
they?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "So I noticed that

that?"

kinds of things is it not listing?"

for the message."

it?"

the question is, can Best change it?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In that case, my best
assumption would be that it would be only you and he that could change it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Cause
that would be major egg on our face."

in a bit if you like, to make sure."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey
Lily, I borrowed Herding Cats to put up some protest beacons. I didn't use any
org funds to buy the parts, but if you're not comfortable with me doing this I
can use a module scout in the future."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I only
used it because it's getting late and I thought it would be quicker this way."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I
could get some sleep."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'd
rather you used a module scout for that because it's easy to use modules not
authorized."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay,
that's a good point."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Also what's the purpose of this messsage beacon?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli and
I wanted to try to discourage merchants from trading in AEU ports."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok
and did you go deploy the Asteroid Processor? It's in the Constructor."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I did."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Tr
org thanks so much for that and I just woke up briefly so going back to sleep.
Talk with you later."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No
prob, have a good sleep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay,
I'll use my module scout to replace these if I have to in the future. Lily
raised the good point that I might accidentally attach the wrong part and make
someone an unwitting contributor."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "By
the way since the Constructor is my own personal starship, I'm not so sure that
I support what Eli is wanting to do. So please us your own or Eli's ship if
interfering is what he is after."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I
understand. Sorry Lily."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can give
you a key to my constructor too, I don't keep any spare parts on there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
see your new Providence message Eli. I'll change the Cheyanne and Riverway ones
to that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay,
that would be good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually
yeah, if you like that I'm already in Riverway I can just change this one too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay,
yeah, I like yours better. I'll get the Cheyanne one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I accidently
cleared it and couldn't remember exactly what it said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I
think we're set."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're going
all in on the strike guys. No work at all. Only defending against threats to
humanity. We're in the home stretch every pilot that joins in will help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know
it's not what you envisioned, Dak, but we may be out of the Accord within a week
if nothing changes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I also
encourage you all to politely disuade merchants from trading. We've set up some
message beacons but it's still good for us to be there in person."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of
course it's all voluntary, we can't make anyone do anything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "None of us
will hold it against you if you choose not to, though if you joined it would be
helpfull."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm going to assume
the both of you are talking to me, since nobody else is really around."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

note, as we all know, the current political climate in the Union is troubled at
best. The first thing I'm going to do is check on the status of the Accord
negotiations and report my findings to you. If any of you have any ideas,
comments, or suggestions about, or simply want to discuss our current
predicament, please contact me. My office door will always be open while I'm

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

          Introduction
We have several types of Battlesuits to help us in our ground combat endeavors.
While I am not going to go deep into details of ground combat in this book, I
will touch on a few things. I will also talk a little bit about the various
functions, module uses and drawbacks of these battlesuits.
The information given in this book is from my experience with ground combat
work. I, in no way, am stating this to be absolute fact.
I hope that you will find something in the following pages that is of help to
you.

          AEU Suit
This suit is your repair suit on most ground activities. You can get loads of
repair abilities once you purchase the Minidrones module. They range from minor
to major in the single and group categories as you gain access to higher tier
suits. Regeneration and Squad Restoration are also among these abilities. These
two abilities will repair in small doses over time.
If you are operating this suit, your primary goal is to repair. It is not to be
firing the lasers while your crew leader is climbing steadily to high
percentages of damage. If you begin repairs early, you may be able to prevent
high amounts of damage to your leader. Doing this may also keep you from having
to use the moderate or major repairs, which can cause opponents to look your way
more often. In the event that you do need to use something higher than single
person minor repairs, be careful. It's all about timing between the League and
AEU suit operators in getting this down without having the AEU suit getting
thumped. The logic of repairing early is very simple because maintaining a
steady flow of repairs is better than having to play catch up and do big burst
repairing in the middle of a fight.
The Sonics module is used heavily with this suit. You have many abilities to
choose from. If a battle gets rough, you can knock out an opponent until you are
ready to take it on, however, use this one wisely. There are also abilities that
deal damage such as Reverb. Pulse is a good one for stunning and interrupting
your target. Learning how and when to use these and other abilities such as
Sonic Wave may or may not take some time. Pace yourself and learn what works
best with the various opponents you will encounter. You can use the Sonics
abilities to help in various ways of battle but don't forget your main
objective. This is to keep the damage to a minimum.

[Starship "Misty Justice"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the
nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside
landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the one-person
cargo hauler "Comet Ray".
Lexie Amarras says, "I hear you. I've been on at times when it's been like
that."
Ted Warburton asks, "What even is one of those?"

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in space.
