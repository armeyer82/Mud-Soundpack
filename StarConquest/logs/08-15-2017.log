00:53:01 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:53:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:55:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well there's some actual truth to Chasing Turtles."

00:56:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

00:56:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As in you know that Ifs one where you need to use a Gem to take a pair of battlesuits into it to kill the inside."

00:56:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Constantine, if you want this one, come to Old Earth. It may be all growed up for I see Eva next."

00:56:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's a Turtle!"

00:57:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I might ask if it's grown up later on. I'm busy at the moment, unfortunately."

00:57:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm gettin ready to go to bed and ain't really got a place to put it."

00:58:24 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If it's a kitten it in theory shouldn't nest. You could pop him on your tug. And I can grab him for Constantine later. Morris."

00:58:38 [General Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Do not pop kittens."

00:58:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

00:58:45 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hmm? I think I missed something."

00:58:47 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

00:59:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Fine. You could place the kitten on your tug, and I can scoop him up for constantine later."

00:59:36 [General Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "The inside, the inside of the tug."

00:59:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Alright. It's likely the only yella one on there."

00:59:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli, shatup."

01:00:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sure thing. I'll track him down."

01:05:52 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles!

01:06:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So my understanding is that the Tandem Pact is what we think of as the Mutuality."

01:06:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that correct?"

01:06:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na."

01:06:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

01:06:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Tandem pact is a larger group of spacers that the Mutuality is a part of."

01:06:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli, I said hi to crawly for ya."

01:06:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

01:06:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have the other upgrades to put on but I just wanted to get the Torus ones installed."

01:07:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good kid/ Eli?"

01:07:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hmm."

01:07:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, I am a good kid."

01:07:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's probably better to think of the tandem pact as the unreg version of the Accord; gathering a bunch of unreg factions into a sort of group that achieves whatever goals they're shooting for."

01:07:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

01:08:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well the reason I asked is that I was wondering if we have to worry about anything we might give to the Mutuality in exchange for QSA access being made available to pirates."

01:08:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't know."

01:08:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I mean, the QSA is going to be available for the pirates whether we like it or not."

01:08:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not sure what you mean? We don't control the QSA and pirates have always had access."

01:09:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "So, I'm not sure what you mean."

01:09:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not really talking about access to the qsa."

01:09:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm talking about the deal we strike with the mutuality."

01:09:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Then what are you talking about?"

01:09:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I don't know what you mean either?"

01:09:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll presumably have to give them something for access."

01:09:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Will that thing be available to pirates?"

01:09:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm trying to fix that. Yeah."

01:09:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It always has."

01:09:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't know, they can fly our ships."

01:09:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I'm not talking about availability of the QSA."

01:10:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I suppose that depends. Evangeline, flying our ships has nothing to do with this whatsoever. They're fucking pirates. They fucking stole them."

01:10:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm talking about avaiability of whatever we give them, for our own access."

01:10:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not that, I mean they can in essence fly our ships."

01:10:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know that."

01:10:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Constantine, as for what we give them, you could always stipulate in your terms that what we give is for the -Mutuality- only."

01:10:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But handle that on a case-by-case basis. See what they want first."

01:10:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right."

01:11:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh yes I see what Constantine is getting at. Good point and I agree with Ather."

01:11:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I guess the question would be can we trust them to stick to that."

01:11:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Probably not."

01:11:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, personally I'd be uncomfortable trading away any kind of military tech now."

01:12:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "As I'm sure the government would."

01:12:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "We will not trade away any military tech to the Mutuality regardless."

01:12:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well 1 right."

01:12:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's a very raw deal for us."

01:12:45 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:12:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

01:12:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli are you around?"

01:13:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I'm not even sure what is on the table. Maybe Vernos needs to ask what the terms of the deal were last time."

01:13:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:13:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No QSA access is worth giving them military technology. Is that what they were wanting for QSA access in the last negotiation?"

01:13:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:13:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No they just wanted the AEU not to Attack them."

01:13:31 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned 1,088,148.16 credits.

01:13:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:13:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They were not asking for any tech and we did bring it up."

01:13:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, we can give assurances of not attacking them when it comes to civilian pilots, but not sure what we could do regarding the navy at this time."

01:13:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not a bad roid."

01:14:03 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."

01:14:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why the fuck would you offer them technology?"

01:14:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know what we would or wouldn't offer them."

01:14:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wrote an apology to the council at any rate and a letter to andre lambeth asking a question I hope will be considered."

01:14:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli had said they were interested in the revo or the jackrabbit, but also noted that the government would never allow that."

01:14:37 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hi."

01:14:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:14:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes I agree but we can firmly request that our Navy not attack under non-aggressive times."

01:14:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't think they will listen."

01:15:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:15:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli, when I brought up Tech, they said they weren't asking for tech."

01:15:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't offer them technology, for sure. Lily, you can firmly request that they change the name of the color blue to green. However, at this time, that request will probably get filed into the same deep dark location which never gets looked at."

01:15:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:15:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh for real."

01:15:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah? Hmm."

01:15:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But don't ever consider offerring them technolgoy. That is a very veyr stupid move."

01:15:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:15:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Still we have to follow through rather than take a limp-wristed approach."

01:16:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Didn't we used to allow them access to the REvo? I know that was a long time ago but..."

01:16:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:16:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:16:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "In the very least, we are affirming to the 9th that we don't support actions of hostility on the part of the aEU Navy towards them."

01:17:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That was when we had a non-aggression pact. Everyone is able to buy the revo and the jackrabbit at non-aggression pact levels. We are not negotiating for a Non-aggression pact, though. We are negotiating for QSA access. Don't forget, it was -them- who dissolved the non-aggression pact. The QSA access is a completely separate entity, not to be confused with it."

01:17:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay, that clears things up. So this is far lower level than any kind of deal that would affect availability of technology."

01:18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes. Technolgoy is completely off the table for this negotiation. Don't bring it up."

01:19:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:19:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We'd only ever consider Tech only if there was a better relationship going forward and nothing less."

01:19:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do what you can with that moron Vernos about trying to coordinate with the government to receive assurances that the AEU won't create any hostile situations against the Mutuality without provication, but don't bring up anything even remotely related to tech-sharing."

01:19:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You just said you foferred a technology trade, Lily."

01:19:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'll ask him about it."

01:19:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "For jus tQSA access. That's nothing to do with our relationship to them."

01:20:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I only brought it up because I wanted to get their reaction but I knew it's not what our government would ever consider at this point. We just need to get the QSA access restored."

01:20:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, don't make such a stupid move again."

01:20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't even mention technology."

01:21:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

01:21:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "What about assisting to defend their space? That's something I heard they were interested in."

01:21:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:21:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:22:16 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:22:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's a much better and more reasonable offer. However, due to current situations with the provication of the current administration, I don't know how they'd take that at this time."

01:22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They're argument was that opening the skims would also give easier access to the AEU Navy as well."

01:22:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, there we go. See?"

01:23:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "They can't just set it for civilian pilots only? Surely there's a difference in transponders."

01:23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I hvae a solution to that, but no one will like it, and the government won't agree to it, so it's probably irrelevant."

01:23:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah it was so either way it's pirates who already have access so I'm not clear on what Constantine was referring to."

01:24:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As far as Iknow, Pirates alrady have their own FTL network."

01:24:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They said that they could not set it just for civilian pilots or civilian ships."

01:24:54 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:25:15 You say to Lily, "Well, the pirates have now been admitted into the Tandem pact."

01:25:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's the solution, Atherton?"

01:25:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah sorry."

01:25:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ather."

01:25:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I bought a second Gem for myself I named it Starfish I probably should have let hte org have that one."

01:25:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:25:45 You chuckle.

01:25:47 You grin.

01:25:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not something I'd be comfortable discussing on an open channel."

01:26:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But is Chasing Turtles ok? I think it's rather humorous."

01:26:15 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Sounds great."

01:26:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

01:26:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli put your number in the directory."

01:27:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "It should be in there."

01:27:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Seriously?"

01:27:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa sighs.

01:27:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Never mind, I'll see you in person. Come to celtic."

01:27:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway, I just feel I should have a backup if my other gem gets blown and I might just actually use Starfish to transport battlesuits and keep Seventh Star in the garage until we can go through the Skim again."

01:27:32 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:27:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "It's not in the directtory? I've had folks getting my number."

01:27:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's fine."

01:27:57 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:28:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ather, since the Allied Pirates are now part of the Tandem Pact, does that mean we can't attack them without receiving the wrath of the Mutuality?"

01:29:00 [General Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "Oh."

01:29:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It most certainly does not. If they provoke you anywhere in AEU space, or unclaimed space, or even in the space of the fringe, EAOS or League, since they have not signed treaties with them, you are able to do whatever you choose to them."

01:29:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Obviously, you are to not attack them in Mutuality space unless fired upon first."

01:30:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, fair enough."

01:30:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "Gimmy a minute and I'll be on my way."

01:30:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hang on, I'm going to the torus for something."

01:31:56 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

01:32:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Good Kid Eli Grey transmits, "I'll meet you over there Eva, just to save time."

01:37:25 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

01:42:17 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:42:24 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:53:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

01:53:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.
You grin.

01:53:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You're being kidnapped."

01:53:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:53:14 You laugh.

01:53:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:53:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:53:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:53:32 You say, "Well, being kidnapped by the most wonderful woman in the universe is fine with me."

01:53:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:53:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:53:38 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:53:38 You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:53:39 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:53:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

01:53:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:53:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:53:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:53:45 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:53:46 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:53:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:53:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:53:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:53:50 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:53:53 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

01:54:09 Lily says to you, "And I jsut love kidnapping the most wonderful and the Handsomest man in the Universe!"

01:54:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:54:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

01:54:18 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

01:54:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:54:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "At least it allowed you to nominate yourself."

01:54:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:54:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:54:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:54:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:55:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:55:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Be right back."

01:55:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

01:55:07 You nod.

01:55:07 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:55:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

01:55:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:55:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

01:55:12 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:55:12 I don't understand that.

01:55:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned 804,798.97 credits and 1 megacredit.

01:56:15 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:56:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

01:56:19 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:56:22 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:56:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh I kicked his sutpid scout."

01:56:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Stupid."

01:56:34 You grin.

01:56:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm glsd to see Dakhal running for Whip."

01:56:52 You nod.

01:57:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So should we invite Dakhal into seas? He is a little slower but he does try."

01:57:24 You nod.

01:57:34 You say, "Sure. Ask Constantine, but I'll vote him in."

01:57:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:57:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine what are your thoughts concerning Dakhal and inviting him to join SEAS?"

01:58:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd be happy to have him."

01:58:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm glad you guys are considering him."

01:59:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:59:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awesome! Would you like to extend the invite since you seem to get on with him fairly well? Of course he would have to wait until he is a pilot for a month but if he is eligible, then you can do the honors."

01:59:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "He seems a decent enough guy to me. He definitely worked hard at running rats out of our has."

01:59:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

01:59:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:59:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Our space, sorry."

01:59:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, will do."

02:00:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident cheers.

02:00:19 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:00:28 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:00:28 Nominations for the next civilian liaison term will continue for another 24 hours! If you would like to nominate yourself for a position, please do so within the next day by visiting your alliance's conference room. [00:00 15 August 2317 GST]

02:00:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:00:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah and the other morning, he did listnen when we asked him to get out of the 777 sector and he managed to get out with no sensors, no weapons, no FTL and all failsafes were blown That was one dead Transport but we managed to save it."

02:01:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:01:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh that could have been a legitimate destruction of an industrial ship."

02:02:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:02:08 You laugh.

02:02:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

02:02:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey, you guys up for beacons?"

02:03:19 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps down from a dark purple leather captain's chair.

02:03:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure."

02:03:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:03:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure!"

02:03:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I definitely want to do a bunch in a few hours, but I can't really right now."

02:04:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:04:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah ok."

02:04:42 I don't understand that.

02:04:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:04:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I put some nice furniture into ourCruiser and pulsar. I am sure glad that shule and I made it to nQ before the QSA was shut down."

02:04:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm less than 800 evasions from my next goal."

02:05:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:05:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident whistles.

02:05:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And me too."

02:05:43 You ask, "Should I ask over tactical?"

02:05:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Sure!"

02:05:54 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Beacons?"

02:06:19 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:06:52 You say, "Or not."

02:06:57 You chuckle.

02:06:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah seems that way."

02:06:59 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:07:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:07:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:07:19 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

02:08:04 [Starship "Blueberry"; Control Room]

02:08:05 A floor lamp is casting a bright halo of light here.  The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows partially obscured by sheer gold curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an AutoVector navigation unit, an oriental rug, a lavender tapestry sectional sofa, a glass coffee table, a small trash can, a Galactic map unit, a sector debris scanner, a starship simulator, a Galactic anomaly recording unit, a Galactic navigation unit, a silver espresso machine, a planetary system surveying unit, a temporary structure launcher, a bottle of fine white wine, a bottle of fine white wine, a large beanbag chair, a floor lamp, Higgins the droid, Daizey the droid, an advanced FTL drive tracer, an internal stun turret, and a plastic cooler here.
You can go southwest and down.
(You are sitting on a lavender tapestry sectional sofa.)

02:08:28 Lily says to you, "You probably won't be happy but I did put a sofa in the Control Room of the Cruiser. As long as others don't bother with the controls, they can sit in there as bystanders."

02:08:43 You say, "Ah, ok. That's fine."

02:08:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, OOCly, "They changed that up."

02:08:59 You say, OOCly, "Yeah, I saw that."

02:09:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:09:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I didn't bolt anything down yet but we'll need to get captains chairs and then we'll bolt things down."

02:09:37 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:09:40 You nod and smile.

02:09:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

02:09:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I did bolt the other rooms chairs down though."

02:09:57 You grin.

02:10:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It looks so pretty."

02:10:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:10:13 You say, "Yeah, I walked through it yesterday."

02:10:17 You smile.

02:10:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Aww."

02:10:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How's the plant in your cruiser doing?"

02:10:34 You say, "Well, the cruiser anyway."

02:10:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:10:51 You say, "It's going really well. Not yet fully grown, but certainly getting there."

02:10:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:10:59 You say, "131 percent."

02:11:02 You say, "So far."

02:11:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:11:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok guys I didn't really get a chance to comment but I guess you noticed I took a backup cutting of our plant. I don't think I will backup all plants but that one is probably our most prized plant to own."

02:12:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I did notice."

02:12:19 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:12:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Obviously there's a couple more and as we gain more slots, we'll back up all of the good ones."

02:12:30 You nod and smile.

02:13:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have a couple of projects for the org once we get a couple more members."

02:13:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

02:13:23 You grin.

02:13:26 You ask, "What is that?"

02:13:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We need to work on our purpose and things."

02:13:37 You grin.

02:13:41 You say, "Very true."

02:13:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And I would like to get other's input."

02:13:59 You say, "That's a good idea."

02:14:19 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

02:14:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm into having us work as a team to be who we are and I believe that builds the climate of the organization and promotes itsspirit. I don't want to dictate things."

02:14:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's spirit that is."

02:15:00 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:15:02 You nod.

02:15:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:16:18 You say, "Our purpose is for all of us to become rich and famous."

02:16:23 You chuckle.

02:16:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers.

02:16:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well.."

02:16:33 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Sunrunner". The organization has earned 250,323.82 credits.

02:16:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I'm rich but I'm sure as hell not very famous!"

02:16:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:16:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:16:46 You laugh.

02:17:20 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:18:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well although I want to promot Exploration, I also want to be an organization who takes pride in helping other pilots who are interested in achieving their best to attain that goal. I believe that our experience can help them."

02:18:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:18:29 You say, "For sure. Me too."

02:18:33 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:22:38 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Bucephalus". The organization has earned 920,497.94 credits.

02:23:19 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:24:19 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

02:30:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Aww nooo. He'd never hurt them. He cuddles up with my sweethearts all the time. He's never ever hurt another felo."

02:31:14 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wait so he's not mean?"

02:31:20 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:31:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sure, if you pet him. But mean felo pets aren't mean to one another. Just like my maned felo never hurts my other pets. Wild ones will attack one another, pets will not."

02:59:53 [Starship "Blueberry"; Control Room]
A floor lamp is casting a bright halo of light here.  The scent of strawberry suffuses the atmosphere of the ship, spread from somewhere in the heart of the ventilation system.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the rose-tinted windows partially obscured by sheer gold curtains, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see an AutoVector navigation unit, an oriental rug, a lavender tapestry sectional sofa, a glass coffee table, a small trash can, a Galactic map unit, a sector debris scanner, a starship simulator, a Galactic anomaly recording unit, a Galactic navigation unit, a silver espresso machine, a planetary system surveying unit, a temporary structure launcher, a bottle of fine white wine, a bottle of fine white wine, a large beanbag chair, a floor lamp, Higgins the droid, Daizey the droid, an advanced FTL drive tracer, an internal stun turret, and a plastic cooler here.
You can go southwest and down.

04:23:39 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So what's happening is that AEU won't contribute any more stuff, but if it comes down to it, the Accord will defend them just like they would League and Fringe. So they're going to freeload now."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

18:21:35 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo!"

18:21:38 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:21:38 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

18:21:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Critical Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

18:21:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:21:45 Katina Faye dances in from the south.

18:21:46 Katina Faye dances out.

18:21:50 Ali Candan strides in from the south.

18:21:51 Ali Candan strides out.

18:21:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:21:54 You are credited with 5,718,531.44 EAOS credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.
Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Laters."

18:21:55 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

18:21:57 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

18:21:59 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:22:06 Mike Breedlove walks in from the south.

18:22:07 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

18:22:08 Mike Breedlove walks out.

18:22:15 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Thanks!"

18:22:17 You wave.

18:22:18 Constantine Stone walks out.

18:22:19 You say, "Wait."

18:22:19 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

18:22:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Constantine, you have my tools."

18:22:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah."

18:22:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

18:22:36 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

18:22:36 You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:22:37 You exit the ship.

18:22:37 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The one-person cargo hauler "Raging Blast", the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 889", and the five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

18:22:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

18:22:57 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

18:23:06 The vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

18:23:08 Constantine Stone exits from the vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk".

18:23:11 Constantine Stone gives you a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

18:23:13 Constantine Stone opens a sturdy dark green canvas backpack.

18:23:14 You say, "Thanks."

18:23:15 Constantine Stone removes a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets from a sturdy dark green canvas backpack.

18:23:18 Constantine Stone puts on a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

18:23:19 You put on a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.

18:23:20 Constantine Stone exclaims, "Yep!"

18:23:21 Constantine Stone closes a sturdy dark green canvas backpack.

18:23:22 You wave.

18:23:24 Some lights on the vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk" flash as Constantine Stone boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

18:23:26 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

18:23:26 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

18:23:26 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

18:23:27 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

18:23:28 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:23:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:24:00 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

18:24:07 There appear to be about 14 pilots recently active.

18:24:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure he was having it."

18:24:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess we'll see."

18:25:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok."

18:27:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What are you up to, Dak?"

18:27:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Want to collect artifacts?"

18:28:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Just doing some light shopping before I become busy. I can do artifacts in about nine hours, though?"

18:29:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I may be asleep by then, but if I'm around, then sure."

18:32:48 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

18:51:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Were you able to tell those folks the news they were lookin for, Morris?"

18:51:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You didn't run out of breath, did you?"

18:51:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gonna hypercast at 'em from the Torus at 2300."

18:51:32 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, right on."

18:52:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "They said they'd be listenin and told me where to start. I was not buildin a station and was not in the mood to look for 'em when I hadn't slept."

19:02:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do exploration grade sensors do?"

19:02:10 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 396,935.17 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

19:13:18 [General Communication] Eli sings as he transmits, "When you're rising from your bed, keep just one thing in your head... No one wants to hear that yawn, get your finger off that comm!"

19:13:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone yawns.

19:15:15 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Hi lexy."

19:16:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I did that for real to Tara the other day. I was all welcoming her back and whatnot."

19:32:49 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

19:34:00 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Anyone feel up to building an artifact detector?"

19:34:53 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 2,300,390.62 credits from a xenology submission.

19:43:47 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Mornin... morning? Afternoon? whatever."

19:44:02 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Hey."

19:44:08 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good daytime."

19:44:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And a good personal timeframe to you, as well."

19:44:15 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "How're you both?"

20:08:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When will I stop getting 3 points for bubble artifacts?"

20:09:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I dunno."

20:14:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not sure, though I want to say it's like 2000?"

20:23:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How can you tell if something has exploration grade sensors?"

20:24:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It'll be in the status."

20:24:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh okay, this long-range detection array?"

20:25:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm, I think so yeah. I wanna say it's somewhere else too. I can't remember if it shows up unless you have the rfit drive installed or not."

20:25:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The rift drive."

20:25:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It shows up if you have a rift drive installed in the status."

20:26:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And what does that do?"

20:26:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Without the rift drive, it won't show up."

20:26:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that what gives me notifications about locations?"

20:26:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It allows you to pick up points of interest and beacons and such, from further away."

20:26:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No, it just increases the range of your sensors. Get the scientific sensor reading."

20:27:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So all it does is increase detection range, basically?"

20:27:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah."

20:27:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And maybe allows certain other upgrades, if I'm interpreting Ather's book correctly."

20:28:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Which can make a difference."

20:28:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It looks like a few things can't be installed on ships that don't have it."

20:28:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That too."

20:28:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And putting three sightseers on a tactical platform gives the platform the long-rage array?"

20:29:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It gives it exploration grade sensors."

20:29:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I could be wrong on this one, but exploration ships should inform you when you find things. I think other ships need the notification component to do that."

20:30:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Explorations ships inform you? I got the autostop upgrade just in case."

20:30:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think they do too, but it's still good to get the scientific sensor reading thing. It increases range of your sensors and also helps ensure you'll be notified of points of interrest."

20:30:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Of course... ugh."

20:30:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought it was th elow-level rift notification thign that did that?"

20:30:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Probably yes."

20:31:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's for ships that don't have exploration grade sensors. The low level notification ensures you get notified of points of interests."

20:31:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And sightseers give the platform battery life, too, right?"

20:31:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes."

20:31:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not a full 20 hours for each one, right?"

20:32:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's not, but it's quite a bit. I'd have to go look."

20:32:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No need, just curious."

20:32:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't even know if they'll give us the rift drive after this mess."

20:32:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, I used to put hte scientific sensor rigging on my ships when it didn' thave much use, just because it made my ships look all scienced up. They were also super cheap back then though."

20:32:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And convert cyclic time to planetary time."

20:33:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was pleased to discover that the platform can fit in a carrier."

20:33:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, whoa I didn't know it did that part. How convenient."

20:33:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's still god to do that. Like I said, it also increases the range of your sensors. Good, that is."

20:33:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know why I thought it was too big."

20:33:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I might still be able to get farport upgrades."

20:33:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I just found this out recently too. That it could dock."

20:34:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's not that big, and yeeah, gert someone to bring your ship over there in a carrier and you'll be set."

20:34:21 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

20:34:21 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

20:34:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still need 20 beacons for my platform."

20:34:23 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

20:34:23 You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:34:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And got knows how many artifacts."

20:34:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "God."

20:34:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm wondering, I thought we couldn't buy upgrades over there? We aren't getting the show."

20:34:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For the rest of the stuff."

20:34:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think we're restricted from buying anything."

20:34:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We just can't use the skim."

20:35:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We can still buy upgrades over ther eEva. We just can't use the skims."

20:35:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh... how odd..."

20:35:13 You exit the ship.

20:35:13 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

20:35:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're not banned from their space or anything."

20:35:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, well that is... slightly inconvenient, but that's all right?"

20:35:19 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

20:35:19 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

20:35:20 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

20:35:21 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.
You can go south and out.

20:35:33 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

20:36:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You know, the AEU channel used to be so quiet. It's really nice to see people talking over it more and to have more chatter on it."

20:37:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think so too."

20:37:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I enjoy even just seeing more folks on the comms, even when we're quiet."
