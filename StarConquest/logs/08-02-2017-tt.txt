Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

help sight-commands
-----------------------
Help on: Sight-commands
-----------------------
In recent months, a large number of visually impaired players have joined Star
Conquest, and in order to make the game more comfortable and accessible for
them, we have added a few very helpful commands that many other players may also
find extremely useful.
SIGHT (S I G H T): The SIGHT command has actually been a part of the game for a
couple of years. Basically this command removes the 'visual' element from
starmaps, screening out a lot of the gibberish that serves only to annoy and
distract visually impaired players while their screen readers frantically recite
dozens of dashes. It also does things like remove all but the ships you have
keys to from the TRANSPORT menu in garages so that screen readers aren't
scrambling to recite five million ship names. Most recently, this command also
adjusts damage reports in starships to only list the damaged components,
eliminating unnecessary extra spam. Overall, this is a very handy command.
BRIEF (B R I E F):  The BRIEF command makes it so that when you're walking
around, room descriptions will not be displayed unless you specifically request
to see it by using the LOOK command.
FOCUS (F O C U S): The FOCUS command is a combat command which allows you to
focus on a single ship during combat instead of getting a huge list of ships to
sort through. You'll be given a list of ships to choose from, and your weapons
room will focus on that ship until you either use the FOCUS command again, or
until the ship has been destroyed.
QUIET (Q U I E T): Finally, the QUIET command, though not specifically intended
for blind players, is very helpful in cutting out starship spam. This command
will only work in the starship you're currently in, and only in the control
room. The starship will stay in quiet mode until you change it.
We hope these commands are helpful to our visually impaired players. We ask that
our other players be understanding. If you come across a player who spells
things very oddly, it's likely not their fault as they can't see the letters and
can only hear how the words sound. Helping them in private with spelling can be
very beneficial to everyone, as long as you do it nicely.

Help on: Sight-commands
-----------------------
In recent months, a large number of visually impaired players have joined Star
Conquest, and in order to make the game more comfortable and accessible for
them, we have added a few very helpful commands that many other players may also
find extremely useful.
SIGHT (S I G H T): The SIGHT command has actually been a part of the game for a
couple of years. Basically this command removes the 'visual' element from
starmaps, screening out a lot of the gibberish that serves only to annoy and
distract visually impaired players while their screen readers frantically recite
dozens of dashes. It also does things like remove all but the ships you have
keys to from the TRANSPORT menu in garages so that screen readers aren't
scrambling to recite five million ship names. Most recently, this command also
adjusts damage reports in starships to only list the damaged components,
eliminating unnecessary extra spam. Overall, this is a very handy command.
BRIEF (B R I E F):  The BRIEF command makes it so that when you're walking
around, room descriptions will not be displayed unless you specifically request
to see it by using the LOOK command.
FOCUS (F O C U S): The FOCUS command is a combat command which allows you to
focus on a single ship during combat instead of getting a huge list of ships to
sort through. You'll be given a list of ships to choose from, and your weapons
room will focus on that ship until you either use the FOCUS command again, or
until the ship has been destroyed.
QUIET (Q U I E T): Finally, the QUIET command, though not specifically intended
for blind players, is very helpful in cutting out starship spam. This command
will only work in the starship you're currently in, and only in the control
room. The starship will stay in quiet mode until you change it.
We hope these commands are helpful to our visually impaired players. We ask that
our other players be understanding. If you come across a player who spells
things very oddly, it's likely not their fault as they can't see the letters and
can only hear how the words sound. Helping them in private with spelling can be
very beneficial to everyone, as long as you do it nicely.
A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.
You hear a low hum as the ship's weapons are powered up.
The floor trembles under your feet.
You hear the sound of metal tearing violently.

Help on: Units
--------------
     The storage unit, often referred to simply as 'unit,' is a mathematically-d
erived measurement of both mass and volume, which developed over many years in
the steadily-growing aerospace industry.  Nowadays, it is ubiquitous in all
forms of space transport, where both mass and volume are large factors.
     The nature of the unit is such that either a high mass or a high volume
results in a high unit measurement.  Conversely, a low mass and a low volume
make for a low unit measurement.
