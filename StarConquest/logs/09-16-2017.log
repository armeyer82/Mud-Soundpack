03:17:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "What've I missed as of late?"

03:17:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nothing much. There's a pizza party with alcohol over at the Old Earth lounge, and a guy got stabbed on Hyperion."

03:17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Though, we're not sure on the whole story of that, just yet."

03:18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh boy. THat's not fun. And nom. Pizza."

03:18:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I need to make a little more cash so I can get a roid hauler. To make more cash. To get more ships, to make more cash...etc."

03:18:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I think they all succesfully read a full book, so they won a pizza party."

03:19:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh wow."

03:20:32 Open what?

03:20:34 You open the door.

03:20:35 You grab the door handle as you leave.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

03:20:46 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Now, I do want to tell you something, Jacob. In telling you, I'm not expecting you to participate, just understand the mindset of the pilots in the corps at present. Most of us are on a full strike; we will not do anything except defend alliance space from enemy invasions. I would encourage you to be on that strike with us, but ultimately, the decision is yours. I understand how empowering it feels to have your full pilot license and all."

03:21:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The reason for the strike is to stop President Best's attempts to remove the alliance from the Accord."

03:22:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I understand. And I think I might just join you on that strike. Even though I've always been told to be productive in some way. I feel kinda weird if I don't do at least some form of work, even if it's a small job."

03:22:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we're not even on the board! Let's do some piloting!"

03:23:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No one actually -wants- to be on this strike. However, if it does manage to change the President's mind, then we can all return to full productivity in no time."

03:23:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm psotively itching to do something. I'ts funny, because the alliance is probably going to have quite a payday when this is all over."

03:24:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know what you mean. I do hope that he changes his mind."

03:24:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They'll be wodnering why they didn't just do it earlier."

03:24:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Right?"

03:35:25 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Later."

03:35:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Chippy Chips are the best. When it comes to simulated potato chips, accept no substitutes."

03:35:51 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah cheers.

03:36:26 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:36:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

03:36:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

03:36:41 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:36:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sorry was talking with Jacob and gave him a bit of startup funds."

03:36:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:36:57 You grin. "No problem."

03:37:01 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:37:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I finally picked up Evenia's nonsense."

03:37:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stomps on the ground!

03:37:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So."

03:37:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:37:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts down a letter.

03:37:40 --
You're assuming quite a bit here Lily.
For the first thing, like I said, Ather asked the orgs to remove Seas. You can go ahead and ask anyone you like.
We are an org, and so we did what he asked.
It was me who physically removed the parts from your warehouse, sure, but that again, was going along with what Ather wanted.
Just because I physically removed the parts, doesn't mean I should get the blame for this situation at all.
And do you honestly think after all the time and effort I've put into 777 that I'd be putting it aside? Well you didn't ask, you just assumed, so let me clarify.
I definitely plan to continue building, but I have managed to convince cats to join this.
So if your concern is newer pilots, well it's going to be even better for them now, because of the better speed getting there etcetera.
But you didn't think to ask, you just abused me and lost your patience.
Sometimes asking questions gets you much further.
Like I said, I have no drama at all with you as a person, or with the members of your org.
So you can say I'm stabbing you in the back all you want, but that's not the case.
I know that you clearly need to get your facts straight, and again, I'd be happy to help you do that.
But name-calling doesn't get you anywhere.
I haven't called you one nasty thing after all you've said, and I could have. But unlike what you seem to think, I don't have a problem with you.
But hell, if you thinking th
03:37:41 at makes your life easier, go ahead.
The fact is I'm trying to better 777.
But of course you didn't give me the chance to explain that.

03:38:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't have my paper dispenser but I'd share what I wrote back."

03:38:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I will."

03:38:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I almost posted it to sEAS."

03:39:30 Shule reads the letter and says, "wow."

03:39:39 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Would anyone remember how many industry points I need to get the asteroid hauler?"

03:39:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "At a guess...75?"

03:39:59 [General Communication] Cadet Anny Rain transmits, "About 75."

03:40:16 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not that drunk."

03:40:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I let that sit in the mailbox for what I guess a week as I simply didn't want to take on her drama."

03:40:57 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Okay. Thanks for that! Guess i'll need to wait a little longer before I can get one. Ah well."

03:41:07 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:41:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So how stupid do you think they think we are?"

03:41:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:41:30 You laugh.

03:41:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Do you have a paper dispenser Love?"

03:42:41 You say, "There you go."

03:42:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cheers.

03:42:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident examines a silver plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

03:42:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident makes a selection on a silver plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of white paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into her waiting hand.

03:42:48 [General Communication] Rogue Romano giggles.

03:44:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives you a sheet of white paper.

03:44:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

03:44:20 --
Evenia,
All of the excuses for which you didn't bother to present justifications prior to the current issues will buy you nothing. I raised issues in plenty of time for you to justify caving into ather Jammoa who has lost a tremendous amount of credibility and you also allowed him to back-stab me and SEAS. So how do you consider that to be very supportive of someone you ... uh considered to be a friend. None of what you claim has any credible sensibilities. So how did you think I was to be able to put up the Transmitter, the Recharging Station, The Watchtower in 777? Oh yeah, we can certainly afford the modules but LIBS and SEAS agreed to work together and very little out there yields much income so what you are trying to use as a poor excuse has no basis whatsoever. So when LIBS quits, then good riddance. We won't have a Rift Inserter but we shall survive without you being the two-faced and dishonest person you are. No thanks!
As for Cats, Melinda blows with the wind. If she thinks it's ok with the bullshitters out there, she's cool with it. As you are now. Otherwise, it's not so I don't trust her as far as I can toss this pull tab that I have in my backpack for some silly reason!
Yeah now you've cozyed up to Melinda you will say anything and it's not surprising.
You have lost all of my respect Evenia. I sure did admire you when you stuck up for what was right rather than what someone like Ather Jammoa wanted because he
03:44:20  is excessively jealous of me for reasons that I would rather not relate right now but mostly because of reasons of his own undoing. So it's this game of I've fallen, so I'll pull down anyone who seems to possess anything akin to what I once had. So it's been nice knowing you Evenia. Ifever SEAS is able to participate with stations again, I won't give you access to anything we own. You've already betrayed us. You are not trustworthy. If seas must put up their own income-producing Temporary Space Stations, we shall and we've been planning to do so.
Lily Kaise

03:48:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No I haven't achieved everything Ather has and I'll never claim to but I know he is a very very threathreatened man now."

03:49:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Threattened."

03:49:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."

03:49:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:49:11 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You've got an engineer whenever."

03:49:27 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:49:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Yeah, u nless they're at GMG or something like that."

03:49:32 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I like gunning in Clippers."

03:49:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But that is not how you regain your stature or redeem yourself."

03:49:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've only flown a Clipper a handful of times."

03:49:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hey. If&you were gonna dust her off% I'd make sur" I were around. Even though I still say t$at so is not the right name for a cruiser."

03:50:43 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I've got a picture of an AEU cruiser with the heavy lasers now, my god, the grid, but the power."

03:50:46 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So I want him to so I can gun my ass off."

04:12:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles and nods to you.

04:12:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure."

04:13:44 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:13:44 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:13:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:13:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:13:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:14:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:14:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:14:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:14:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:14:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:14:27 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

Melinda, you apparently missed my prior post. Sometimes we can't be in more than one place. I am just not able to work as much as I used to and if I'm here during the early mornings at times at all, it's for a very short time. Last week was one of those weeks when I was available on Monday, not long on Tuesday and then not until the weekend. So below is what I said.
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.
Unfortunately, i was unable to be on hand last week with the exception that I was available on September 4th when eli said that this protest would begin that day.
i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference.
i'm adding that Johann has called me before when I wasn't available to put up a station. He denies that he was annoyed but that's not how his tone sounded so that's just how it was.
I most definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety of AEU citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.
I certainly will continue to fight the fight to debunk Outccord when I am able to. I will have time off and on over the weekend so if anything in the way of new protest activities are organized, I'll be there!
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there last week.
i have done as much as I can to oppose Outccord. I have sponsored signs in Providence and in Riverway. I have attended Eli's broadcasts whenever I could and I have chased away Merchants when I could and will continue to do so. If another protest occurs, if I am available, I will be there. If not,then just as many other AEU pilots weren't on hand for their own reasons, then this is how it is.
I apologize again but I but you also jumptd to a hasty conclusion based upon what Ather said without knowing what i was really doing regarding opposition to Outccord. Eli spoke up for me as well. So I know you will do what you will do regardless of what I say.
If SEAS is never allowed on stations again, we shall build our own and yes move on. We are qualified to obtain sufficient modules to build all of the income-producing stations including Xenology. We would prefer to work with others but when we have stopped Outccord, then if you all don't want to be reasonable, then we'll manage. So in order to prevent the competition that you all don't like, then common sense says we ought to work together.

14:56:00 You say, "Yeah, she does."

14:56:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Also our pitch to aEU pilots is that they can earn AEU credits too when they have had to earn League all the time."

14:57:33 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yeah, it's because the League insist on putting their cores on many stations."

14:58:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep and it's what they claim to satisfy Aisling who is really the only one most of the time who does any work. Anfisa will engineer for some at times but rarely works."

15:07:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm sure I shocked Melinda and I know I'm repeating myself. I would be willing to bet that she didn't think we would do what I sais SEAS will do and grovel."

15:07:42 You say, "Yeah, you probably did."

15:09:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't care if League or Fringe never use them either. As I say from AEU I believe we'll have enough to support our needs. We might not keep them up non stop bu we'll see how they produce for us."

15:47:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

15:47:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:47:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "286 so that's west of orion?"

15:47:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:47:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:47:10 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: P<:w1Jq2PO04r91sne1_fHtD52i^qR/8_?a|33_A

16:31:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh you lyer Melinda. Yeah one person, Ather Jamo."

16:31:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Eli took up for me and I wasn't pointing at him."

16:31:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

16:32:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

16:32:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

16:32:03 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

16:34:07 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

16:34:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

16:35:57 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

16:36:02 You scramble to your feet.

16:36:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:36:03 You exit the ship.

16:36:03 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

16:36:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

16:36:07 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:36:10 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

16:36:10 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

16:36:13 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident.

Apparently you missed the point. A simple apology goes a long way. You didn't have to point fingers at Johann, Ather and Eli. I understand stuff happens so go with it and stop putting blame on others. Anyway, no one person made this decision. Since this issue had to do with the AEU, I am going to let the AEU pilots make the call as to when work with you is continued.

Lily, I think the point you're missing here is that we all want you to just take responsibility. Stop pawning it off on Eve (who had literaly nothing to do with it and doesn't deserve your vitriol), Johann, Melinda, Ather, and whoever else. All it would have taken was, "I messed up, I'm sorry." When I was a boy I was taught about something called natural consquences. When we do something there are always consequences. Some kids get whooped, but my parents believed in what we do making its own consequences. What's happening now is exactly that. We're not punishing you. You did this to yourself. And if you can own up to what you did instead of blaming everyone else, it'll go a long way. You may not have sent me one of your nastygrams, but I got to read it and read what was on the board. Take some responsibility. Stop trying to spread the shit around and just admit you screwed up. It would go a lot farther than maybe you think. Everything we do has consequences, and you can't blame the word for what happens. Learn from your mistakes. You'll be a lot happier that way.

Lily, I have never been annoied because a station wasn't put up on time. If I ever ask it's to just make sure that it's being covered, and if not, then I am happy to do so. In that regard, this protest was a relatively important thing for everyone, but especially the AEU. I think anyone would have understood a late station in this instance.
We would have loved to see you at the protest, and hopefully you are able to make any future activities regarding Outccord.

Evenia is my assistant coordinator. We will be working together to keep stations running as smoothly as possible and with as little issues as possible. She will handle things when I am away and if both of us are away, you all will survive.

As always, if you have any station issues, gripes or changes you would like to see made, shoot me a letter and we'll see what we can do to sort it out.

Hey there,

I just wanted to explain this station thing for Lily. I chose to make this public because she took her rant public.

Lily, while most everyone was at the protest, something important for your alliance, you were building stations. Some of us even took rock shots in the heads by your all's crazy antipeople groups. So, while I don't care and don't need to hear the why for's, you just weren't there, it's done.

An apology would have worked out nicely rather than trying to place blame on others, which seems to be your pattern. Ather was very let down and upset by your not being as at the protest, were we all. He threw it out there for you not to be on stations and we all agreed. So, if you want back in on stations, this is how I feel it works, put a real apology up on the public boards and we'll talk to Ather. Yes, that's me making a demand but I don't think I am asking much.

And one more thing, stop blaming everybody for what went wrong, it happened, you didn't make it, suck it up and try to move on.

Melinda

Melinda, you apparently missed my prior post. Sometimes we can't be in more than one place. I am just not able to work as much as I used to and if I'm here during the early mornings at times at all, it's for a very short time. Last week was one of those weeks when I was available on Monday, not long on Tuesday and then not until the weekend. So below is what I said.
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.
Unfortunately, i was unable to be on hand last week with the exception that I was available on September 4th when eli said that this protest would begin that day.
i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference.
i'm adding that Johann has called me before when I wasn't available to put up a station. He denies that he was annoyed but that's not how his tone sounded so that's just how it was.
I most definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety of AEU citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.
I certainly will continue to fight the fight to debunk Outccord when I am able to. I will have time off and on over the weekend so if anything in the way of new protest activities are organized, I'll be there!
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there last week.
i have done as much as I can to oppose Outccord. I have sponsored signs in Providence and in Riverway. I have attended Eli's broadcasts whenever I could and I have chased away Merchants when I could and will continue to do so. If another protest occurs, if I am available, I will be there. If not,then just as many other AEU pilots weren't on hand for their own reasons, then this is how it is.
I apologize again but I but you also jumptd to a hasty conclusion based upon what Ather said without knowing what i was really doing regarding opposition to Outccord. Eli spoke up for me as well. So I know you will do what you will do regardless of what I say.
If SEAS is never allowed on stations again, we s
16:55:01 hall build our own and yes move on. We are qualified to obtain sufficient modules to build all of the income-producing stations including Xenology. We would prefer to work with others but when we have stopped Outccord, then if you all don't want to be reasonable, then we'll manage. So in order to prevent the competition that you all don't like, then common sense says we ought to work together.

Citizens of humanity, Outccord is currently on hold but it must be stopped completely
If the Union pulls out of the Accord, it will weaken our best fighting chance against the alien threats that want to destroy us
President Best wants people to think that the Union doesn't need the rest of humanity, he even wants to kick folks out just for being born in other alliances
the Union pilots have been trying, but the one thing we haven't done is asked the rest of humanity for help, or to show that they want the Union to stay in the Accord
so, today starting at 20:00 we will begin protesting outside of the old AEU headquarters, straight north from the New Phoenix spaceport
this is your chance, as members of other alliances, to come out and show the citizens that you don't want the Accord to lose the support of the Union
Please come and join us, help show the people of the Union that we all stand together
i will likely be staying at the site for a couple of days, I do not however expect anyone else to do so. 
We can end this madness together if we try

The trip is delayed for a couple of days, maybe more. I will post again Friday with more details. Sometimes we just have to put our personal work related things away and stand up for humanity.

Subject: assistant temp station coordinator
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 07:16  8 September 2317 GST

So, keeping all these temp stations and builders together might seem easy but at times it can be a bit of a job.

I am looking for an assistant coordinator. Their job would be as follows:

1. stand in coordinator in the event of my absence for any reason. This would entail both long and short absences from work.
2. Have the ability to discuss decisions that need to be made with me so that I don't miss a possible solution.

3. Be willing to put personal views of others aside for the continued station building work relationship of the organizations.

If you are interested, send me a letter by September 12th. Please explain why you are interested and your station building experience whether it be none, minimal, mid-range or extensive.

One final note, I do not usually just make big decisions on my own. Getting a feel for what other organizations think is how I have decided to run the show. You must also be willing to do that.

Thanks in advance,
Melinda

I have been informed that the op should be good to go. So, I will be leaving to build this afternoon. People can decide whether to go out tomorrow or later tonight. For me, it will probably be tomorrow. Or well after midnight at least. Those who need a lift, holler. If people can't salvage that debris grade, which is 80, they can go haul some roids, defend the ops and hang out in the lounge.

Note that we will be setting up broadcasters in case we are needed or people just want to talk to us from home.

thanks to everyone who showed up to show their support for the Union staying in the Accord.
I hope that we at least got through to some folks on the ground. We showed people that the pilots of humanity stand together no matter what alliance we are from
we also raised 14.5 billion credits to help get creche access to citizens of the Union that don't have them. this was not part of the protest, however it was a subject that came up during the course of it, and pilots of all alliances jumped at the chance to help their fellow humans
I am filled with hope by the number of you that not only showed up, but stayed so long to show their support. do not give up, Outccord still has not happened and yet and we must do whatever we can to try to stop it.
we've all come to know each other a little better over the last few days and I hope that we all continue to do so.
for now though, the protest is over. thank you all once again for coming out
May you all find peace and joy in your lives

I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.
Unfortunately, i was unable to be on hand this week with the exception that I was available on September 4th when eli said that this protest would begin that day.
i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference as I most definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety of AEU citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.
I certainly will continue to fight the fight to debunk Outccord when I am able to. I will have time off and on over the weekend so if anything in the way of new protest activities are organized, I'll be there!

Lily, I have never been annoied because a station wasn't put up on time. If I ever ask it's to just make sure that it's being covered, and if not, then I am happy to do so. In that regard, this protest was a relatively important thing for everyone, but especially the AEU. I think anyone would have understood a late station in this instance.
We would have loved to see you at the protest, and hopefully you are able to make any future activities regarding Outccord.

Evenia is my assistant coordinator. We will be working together to keep stations running as smoothly as possible and with as little issues as possible. She will handle things when I am away and if both of us are away, you all will survive.

As always, if you have any station issues, gripes or changes you would like to see made, shoot me a letter and we'll see what we can do to sort it out.

Hey there,

I just wanted to explain this station thing for Lily. I chose to make this public because she took her rant public.

Lily, while most everyone was at the protest, something important for your alliance, you were building stations. Some of us even took rock shots in the heads by your all's crazy antipeople groups. So, while I don't care and don't need to hear the why for's, you just weren't there, it's done.

An apology would have worked out nicely rather than trying to place blame on others, which seems to be your pattern. Ather was very let down and upset by your not being as at the protest, were we all. He threw it out there for you not to be on stations and we all agreed. So, if you want back in on stations, this is how I feel it works, put a real apology up on the public boards and we'll talk to Ather. Yes, that's me making a demand but I don't think I am asking much.

And one more thing, stop blaming everybody for what went wrong, it happened, you didn't make it, suck it up and try to move on.

Melinda

Melinda, you apparently missed my prior post. Sometimes we can't be in more than one place. I am just not able to work as much as I used to and if I'm here during the early mornings at times at all, it's for a very short time. Last week was one of those weeks when I was available on Monday, not long on Tuesday and then not until the weekend. So below is what I said.
I'm proud of you all and appreciate everyone's support and efforts to pressure the AEU Government and in our opposition to Outccord. The average AEU citizen needs to become more aware and this is what it takes! Sadly, due to circumstances beyond my control, i couldn't be there.

i apologize for putting up the Beacon in 777 but i was concerned that Johann would be annoyed and it has nothing to do with personal preference.
i'm adding that Johann has called me before when I wasn't available to put up a station. He denies that he was annoyed but that's not how his tone sounded so that's just how it was.
I most definitely abhor what the WORST administration is doing to the entirety of AEU citizens and especially to those who are from other Worlds and Territories.
i was caught in the middle of wanting to be there for others and especially less experienced pilots which was the original intent of Artifact Alpha 777 I only had a little time and I couldn't be in both places at one time.

i have done as much as I can to oppose Outccord. I have sponsored signs in Providence and in Riverway. I have attended Eli's broadcasts whenever I could and I have chased away Merchants when I could and will continue to do so. If another protest occurs, if I am available, I will be there. If not,then just as many other AEU pilots weren't on hand for their own reasons, then this is how it is.
I apologize again but I but you also jumptd to a hasty conclusion based upon what Ather said without knowing what i was really doing regarding opposition to Outccord. Eli spoke up for me as well. So I know you will do what you will do regardless of what I say.
If SEAS is never allowed on stations again, we s
16:59:25 hall build our own and yes move on. We are qualified to obtain sufficient modules to build all of the income-producing stations including Xenology. We would prefer to work with others but when we have stopped Outccord, then if you all don't want to be reasonable, then we'll manage. So in order to prevent the competition that you all don't like, then common sense says we ought to work together.

Apparently you missed the point. A simple apology goes a long way. You didn't have to point fingers at Johann, Ather and Eli. I understand stuff happens so go with it and stop putting blame on others. Anyway, no one person made this decision. Since this issue had to do with the AEU, I am going to let the AEU pilots make the call as to when work with you is continued.

Lily, I think the point you're missing here is that we all want you to just take responsibility. Stop pawning it off on Eve (who had literaly nothing to do with it and doesn't deserve your vitriol), Johann, Melinda, Ather, and whoever else. All it would have taken was, "I messed up, I'm sorry." When I was a boy I was taught about something called natural consquences. When we do something there are always consequences. Some kids get whooped, but my parents believed in what we do making its own consequences. What's happening now is exactly that. We're not punishing you. You did this to yourself. And if you can own up to what you did instead of blaming everyone else, it'll go a long way. You may not have sent me one of your nastygrams, but I got to read it and read what was on the board. Take some responsibility. Stop trying to spread the shit around and just admit you screwed up. It would go a lot farther than maybe you think. Everything we do has consequences, and you can't blame the word for what happens. Learn from your mistakes. You'll be a lot happier that way.

Lily.
I am going to be quite blunt. the letters you sent to Evenia crossed a major line. We are professionals, not junior high school students. Decisions made in professional situations are not indicative of personal feelings towards individuals. If you want to be angry at me, Evenia told me what she did on Ather's behest, and I approved it. You can send me all the hate mail you want because after I see the first one isn't worth reading, I'll just go camping and roast marshmallows with the rest.
Regardless of future involvement by anybody, 777 will remain up for new pilots to salvage and artifact, and Allied Libertarians will always be involved. If you wish to go your own way, you are of course free to do so, but if Seas ever wishes to work with Lib again, there will be an appology made to my station coordinator, and a promise to at least be able to conduct civil discourse.
all the Best,
Johann Schraft, Allied Libertarians Founder

Morris,
You fail to recognize that theres a difference between natural consequences and peoples choice in the way they react to something. I am sorry for feeling the urgency that there was a beacon that had expired. It's a natural reaction to feel the urgency that others depend on a beacon or otherwise and to rush into action.
I don't know how else I can express that I'm sorry for making this choice. You all do have your own agenda though as you would have recognized this in lieu of my other very dedicated efforts to oppose Outccord and to express my outrage towards the violence towards non-citizens of the AEU.
I apologize for chosing to do what I did but I felt caught in the middle of feeling responsible for both situations. I didn't even know that there was a protest going on as well until eli spoke to me over the AEU channel and I was already en route. Yes I could have turned around as well.

Wow! What did I come back to? As AEU pilots hopefully knew, I have not been able to be very active for about a week and a half. I understand that misunderstandings happen and apparently, some drama took place while I was unable to be at work consistently.
From my understanding, a multi-day protest against Outcoord took place on New Earth sometime around the 4th in which civilian pilots from more than one alliance participated. I applaud those who were available and took the time to take a stand against such a terrible thing. Had I been available, I would have enthusiastically joined those in the protest.
I would like to emphasize that from the very beginning of all of this, going as far back as the first broadcast, taking a stand against Outccord has been a highly encouraged, but ultimately volunteer affair. I have chosen to stand with my fellow pilots and have attended every event that I could, including going so far as to self-destruct my transport over New Earth. Since then, I have honored the strike and continued to join Eli and other fellow pilots in broadcasts and alike. I am deeply sorry that I was unable to attend the protest.
Now, I was not there during the protest and therefore am unable to give a firsthand account as to who did what. However, it seems that Lily, being short on time, made a choice to go put up a beacon out at 777. This choice, triggered a string of events that Morris calls "natural consequences."
And here is where I would like to share my two credits if I may. First of all, there is a difference between "natural consequences" and the choice that people make in reacting to a situation. For example, if one touches a hot stove, obviously getting hurt is a "natural consequence". However, how people choose to react around you is their choice and only theirs. For example, the AEU has been on strike now for over a month. Is it a "natural consequence" that the AEU government has not really responded to our demands? No, I say that it is their choice.
Despite common belief, when someone is asked to do something, ultimately it is the person's choice to agree to their request or not. We are all sentient beings with the ability to make choices. It is the ability to choose that we fought for against the outsiders and cherish daily. When Eli asked me to stand with him during broadcasts, it was ultimately my choice to join him or not. Think about that any time anyone asks you to do something. Whether or not you take the action that they requested is solely your responsibility. We are all ultimately responsible for our own individual actions. Saying that someone asked me to do it and failing to take responsibility for following through with that person's request does not relieve you of that responsibility.
I understand that Ather was very upset that Lily was unable or in the opinion of the people, chose not to attend the protest. I'm not saying he was wrong to feel that way. I understand that it was an important event. However, Lily did offer an explanation and did express that she wishes she could have been there. However, not allowing SEAS to participate in stations, not only punishes Lily, but also punishes all of the rest of the members of SEAS. People who have been very supportive of the AEU's actions to take a stand against Outccord. While I understand that many of you were upset that Lily didn't attend the protest, how you react is still your choice to make and for now, it seems your choice is to punish all of SEAS, including me. This went from a personal issue and became an org issue. Seems rather unfair to me.
I have always been as helpful as I can be to all of you and though I have been angered by some of the actions people have taken in the past, I have always strived to be understanding towards all of you. We all make mistakes and I'm sure all of us can do a better job apologizing when we offend people, but as someone once told me, the only way someone can offend you is if you let them. 
Having said all of that, let's just drop this issue and quit beating a dead horse into the ground. Believe me, there have been times in the past when I could have created just as much drama over something that someone did to me, but again, my choice not to and I accept that choice. So, how you all respond is up to 
18:12:00 you and only you. Take care all of you and fly safe.

Subject: Death and Avarice is calling all pilots. Preliminary post
Author: Johann Schraft
Posted: 15:23 16 September 2317 GST
--
Hello all! allied Libertarians is planning an artifacting trip out to a virgin field called Death and Avarice. Departure date is still up in the air, but plan on in the next couple weeks.
Here's what we know so far.

the field is out down Feng Wo way, and is most likely alien artifacts. Nissi is kindly providing Future Crimes for ship transport, and Lib will be setting up the beacon, watchtower, and recharger. We will be artifacting close to two weeks, plus travel time add on a possible week for a total of three weeks gone.

Procedures are as follows.

Those who can, bring your smallest artifacting ship. If you have siteseers or runabouts those are preferred. On the watchtower, if you encounter qi clan ships, don't fire at them unless they lock on you or another pilot.
It's possible some people won't have the requirements for a ship out there, so if you are willing to take someone, please do so.
AEU people, you are welcome to come if you so desire, although we know you are striking, and if you feel it violates the spirit of the strike, you should by all means stay back.

If you are interested in going, please either send me a letter, or reply to this post because I'll probably forget it if you tell me verbally.

If I am forgetting anyth
18:15:41 ing, please use common sense, don't ping, and I will update you as we finalize the departure date and any other things to expect.

thanks,
The Allied Libertarians Team

18:25:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Do you mind flying us to New earth please so I can reinstate you? I can't launch this I don't htink even with you being here."

18:25:46 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anyone interested in an op? Need at a couple salvagers and four defenders preferably."

18:25:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:25:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:25:54 You say, "Sure."

18:25:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:25:56 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Me."

18:26:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:26:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:26:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:26:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:26:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:26:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

18:26:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:26:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:26:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:26:18 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

18:26:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:26:21 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

18:26:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:26:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:26:23 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.

20:41:15 [The Torus; The Arboretum]

20:41:15 Between the windows on each side of this section of corridor are two arches perhaps twenty feet high, each one containing a small green tree with lacy leaves. The trees grow from beneath the floor, their slender, dark brown trunks emerging from decorative circular grates. While most of the illumination here is provided by the lighted walls, tiny star-like lights twinkle from the boughs of the trees. Three doorways on the outer side of the corridor lead to small shops, one selling souvenirs, the second identified by a brightly lit twinkling sign as 'Holiday Ornamentation,' and the third named 'The Ontological Felo,' which has articles of oddly shaped clothing in a small display window next to the doorway.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also mentioned that he should let me know if you can't come, Lily, and that I haven't yet decided if I should go due to the time it would take out of the term."

20:41:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Stay put."

20:41:36 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Beta.
You see a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, Meow the little calico CatBot, and a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.

20:41:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

20:41:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I said that regardless of whether Lily or I could go, the rest of the org might want to go. Is that true?"

20:41:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't sent it yet."

20:41:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like would you still go Shule?"

20:41:59 You laugh.

20:42:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Tara's not around, but I'm sure she would enjoy going."

20:42:23 You say, "Ok, I'll stay put."

20:42:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok life support is still nominal with us two."

20:42:33 You nod.

20:42:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So a ocuple more probably won't kill us heh."

20:42:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But."

20:42:43 You chuckle.

20:42:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sochuckle."

20:42:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

20:42:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So see if you can launch it with me here?"

20:43:05 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:43:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:43:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:43:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:43:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:43:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Happy, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:43:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:43:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh good."

20:43:17 You exclaim, "Woo!"

20:43:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:43:24 You struggle to see around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident as you work with a nearby control panel.

Shuttles:
One-person runabout (gotten from SSN)
Point requirements: none.
Weapons: two turrets
Stock cargo: 10000 units.
Stock charge: 8 hours.
While this ship is findable on SSN, you can if you're so inclined check to see if other pilots might have tickets that they might be willing to part with, saving you from needing to watch SSn until tickets redemable for the ship come up on sale! That is one of the reasons I didn't put a price for this ship down, though expect to pay a minimum of 170 million EAOS credits for it. More if you get your ticket from another pilot. Once you have your ticket, just redeem it at any ship store. This ship is attachable to a tactical platform like other shuttles. However, the bonuses it gives to the tactical platform are presently unknown. It also does seem to get a minor max drive velocity bonus.

One-Person Interplanetary Shuttle 5,000,000.00 (Old Earth in the city of Cherise)
U-1A UNITED FREIGHT D'INTSEC INTERPLANETARY SHUTTLE
Class: Shuttle
Requirements: 100 industry points
Model number: U-1a                      Designation: Interplanetary Shuttle
Turret hardpoints: 0                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 17500        Standard battery hours: 6
Docking bay size required: 23
This ship is mainly useful for intermediate levels of trading. You cannot salvage with it, but you can attach it to a tactical platform if you're so inclined. Note: this ship does not have an FTL drive.

One-Person Luxury Sightseer 105,000,000.00 (any hermes branch)
H-07 HERMES COMMUNICATIONS TWO PASSENGER LUXURY SIGHTSEER
Class: Shuttle
Requirements: 2000 industry points      1750 exploration points
Model number: H-07                      Designation: Luxury Sightseer
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 2500         Standard battery hours: 18
Docking bay size required: 5
You might be asking yourselves, "Why didn't Ather leave this in the passenger ships section?" Wel, this ship is only capable of delivering two passengers, so it really isn't in a specific tier level because of that, and because of the number of required points. However, it is equipped with exploration-grade sensors, which would make it a fairly useful ship for exploration, especially if one wishes to install an impeller on the thing. Even better, it can be hooked up to a tactical platform, adding benefits to that particular ship in its own ways. So, this ship has uses that would probably be geared towards anything other than delivering passengers. However, if you want to use it to deliver passengers, well, it can deliver passengers. Enjoy.

One-Person Long-Range Sightseer (approval required) (any Hermes branch)
H-07B HERMES COMMUNICATIONS TWO PASSENGER LUXURY LONG-RANGE SIGHTSEER
Class: Shuttle
Requirements: 2500 industry points      2500 exploration points
21:02:55 
Model number: H-07b                     Designation: Long-Range Sightseer
Turret hardpoints: 2                    Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 2500         Standard battery hours: 20
Docking bay size required: 5
This ship has a living quarters, and can be attached to a tactical platform. It is a passenger ship like the above-listed ship, so you can use it to deliver passengers if you really want to. However, with its twenty-hour battery life it would probably be more suited for the bonuses it has to offer the tactical platform like the other sightseer.

21:06:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If you read the message, he was requesting sightseers and/or runabouts and then idiots like Goss chime in wanting to take scouts and the League scout is larger."

21:06:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So if those are 15 units, well there you go."

21:07:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in an overstuffed dark green chair and goes to sleep.

Sorry, the phone was acting up. Here's the update.

We will be departing on Friday, September 22, at 23:59. Please respond if you are going at least twelve hours before departure so we can organize who's going in the carrier and who is going with me in the transport.
Thanks,

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. 
22:32:02 If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeti
22:32:02 ng should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 21 August 2317 GST. Time remaining: 15 days, 3 hours, 31 minutes, and 38 seconds

Lily:

The blame for this doesn't belong with Evenia or Johann or even really with the person who asked us all to leave your org off stations after that incident during the protest. That was just the final straw. Many had been kicking around the idea of making others responsible for your stations for days before that. And that is completely because you've made it as difficult as possible for certain other people also involved in station building to work with you. If you're going to blame something, blame that.

You know I have always trusted you on my expedition crews and so on, that I've never had any serious issue with you or been much for the bashing of you that goes on sometimes. So I hope you can trust me when I say that given what needs to happen with stations on a regular basis, this will just work out better for everyone. I'm sure things can return to normal once you show you can set aside differences to work with people professionally, but your posts here aren't the way to do that. Until then this is the best way to keep stationbuilding going smoothly. That's it. There's no conspiracy against you.

23:14:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's fine, we'll build our own. They won't lose anybody's business but ours so it won't really matter to them but if it does, perhaps they will rethink their hardened stance."

23:14:44 You nod.

23:19:34 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Exploration.

23:19:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok I have mail."

23:19:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Be back unless you want to fly over to New Earth?"

23:20:07 You say, "Oh, ok."

23:20:08 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:20:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:20:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:20:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:20:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:20:15 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 384" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

23:20:17 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 384" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:20:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:20:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:20:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:20:26 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:20:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:20:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:20:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:20:32 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:20:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:20:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:20:35 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

23:20:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:20:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:20:37 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:20:39 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

23:20:40 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

23:20:40 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

23:20:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:20:53 You're already sitting.

23:21:05 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

23:21:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

23:21:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:21:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:21:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

23:21:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:21:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:21:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

23:21:25 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

23:21:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:21:28 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

23:21:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

23:21:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:21:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:21:31 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:21:32 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:22:01 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:22:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yay Johann says we cna go."

23:38:18 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sure. I could engineer them. It's been ages."

23:38:20 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:38:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

23:38:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "Give me a few to finish this letter if it's ok Love?"

23:38:39 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Need 3 more for the only ships I got use of right now."
