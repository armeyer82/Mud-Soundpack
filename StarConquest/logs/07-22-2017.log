00:22:37 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

00:25:19 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Slender threads glitter in diffuse light that filters from an indistinct source, woven together into elaborate webs that stretch across everything. The walls of the starship are obscured by the curtains of silk, a twisting infinity of webs draped over rock visible through the windows. The air is cool and moist, smelling of rock and decay. The silence is occasionally broken by a brief gust of wind or the sound of numerous legs skittering across a rock surface. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Endless waves ripple off into the distance beyond this wooden ship's railings. Thick timbers rest underfoot, creaking steadily as the craft bobs up and down. Large white sails billow overhead, propelling the ship across the sea's surface at a steady pace. Puffy white clouds float through the sky placidly while a bright yellow star beats down with merciless heat. Salt spray fills the air intermittently when the ship crashes through a wave, and the rope rigging creaks loudly with each gust. A few gulls circle lazily overhead, although no land is in sight. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic fe

05:08:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon

06:21:47 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:21:47 Peeking through the nebula is a quite large space station shaped oddly like a fleur-de-lys. The ship's sensors crackle to life, as a cheerful mix of Esperanto and Quebecois begins playing over the audio channels.

06:21:52 You grin.

06:21:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Woo finally."

The straight sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller, somewhat less crowded plazas.

20:58:11 [Nouveau Quebec; Au Joyeux Caribou]

20:58:11 This cheerful establishment is decorated like an old-fashioned neighborhood bar. Small square wooden tables with padded red stools pulled up around them are randomly arranged across the floor, which is laid with faux wooden planks. Small colored lights shine over the scarred wooden counter at the back of the bar, and the walls are decorated with murals of wintry scenes where herds of brown and white caribou cross the wind-swept snow. The kitchen behind the bar is little more than several grills, a deep fat frier, a chopping block, and a refrigerator.
You see a battered recycling bin here.

21:44:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine, if you get a moment or aren't headed to Foxtrot to meet the Space Buss to here, could you please check the Range office for the Transmitter in 777? I'm curious to know how much time is remaining on that station?"

21:44:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course."

21:45:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:45:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thanks much! For some reason, Johann thought it was down. It doesn't have much range after you leave the area but it's there."

21:49:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident chuckles. "Not familiar with that one, thought you meant the SDC one, but you're not here it seems."

21:49:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's in the org office, way at the end of the hallway and off to the right."

21:50:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be there in one second."

21:50:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh ok."

21:50:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry."

21:51:36 You whisper to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:51:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident beams at you.

21:52:23 Several girls enter, order caribous, and leave with their drinks, chattering all the while in rapid French.

21:52:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Guess i'll phone Johann."

21:57:23 The cook and the bartender share a laugh and then get back to work, speaking quietly to each other in French.

21:57:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident touches the screen of a metallic gold touch einrophone, then swipes her finger across it to lock it.

21:59:23 Two girls at a table in the corner get up and leave hand in hand.

22:02:23 The bartender comes out from behind the bar and clears a few empty tables.

22:03:23 Soft tinny jazz plays in the background.

22:04:23 Several women at a nearby table begin a song in French then laugh and down their drinks, immediately calling for more.

22:04:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry about the delay -- what's the scooping station called?"

22:06:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, don't know how I missed it. Just under 2 days left."

22:07:23 Soft tinny jazz plays in the background.

22:08:23 Soft tinny jazz plays in the background.

22:09:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No."

22:10:15 You say, "He wishes though."

22:10:24 You hear a loud sizzle as a portion of spicy meat hits the grill behind the bar, sending up a cloud of steam.

22:10:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am admittedly lost."

22:10:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where are you lost?"

22:10:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Somewhere near A-36."

22:11:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unlike a good SDC, I don't have a scanner to look for you."

22:11:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I was going to ask if he was lost in his office."

22:11:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But she was with you the other night, right? After the broadcast?"

22:12:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not really any of my business I guess. Just curious."

22:14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Are you guys together though? It's kinda hard to tel."

22:14:23 The tinny jazz stops for a moment then continues with a new song.

22:15:23 Two girls at a table in the corner get up and leave hand in hand.

22:19:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No."

22:19:24 A man in syrup-splattered blue coveralls gets up from his table and stumbles outside.

22:19:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh ok. Kinda seemed like you might be for a while. Well, I suppose that clarifies that rumor."

22:20:23 The cook and the bartender share a laugh and then get back to work, speaking quietly to each other in French.

22:20:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm with Lily, if that clarifies that rumor too."

22:21:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know. Shocking huh? Never would have guessed it would you have?"

22:22:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I just thought you two were like.. you know.. kissing buddies."

22:22:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What the."

22:27:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah."

22:28:24 Several men suddenly start singing the Nouveau Quebec national anthem, their words slurred. After only a few bars they stop and pound the table, laughing uproariously.

22:28:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And constantine, check your reports, check the sectors on your terminal and do beacons. That is at least a good foundation I figure for being Space Defense Captain."

22:29:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just checked the home sectors and we're looking good."

22:29:24 You hear a loud sizzle as a portion of spicy meat hits the grill behind the bar, sending up a cloud of steam.

22:29:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "How do I look at battle reports, Shule?"

22:30:00 You ask, "Huh, what do you know of being SDC, Vernos?"

22:30:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just the reports on your desk."

22:30:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."

22:30:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

22:31:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No problem. When you're done reading them, stamp them."

22:31:24 A man in syrup-splattered blue coveralls gets up from his table and stumbles outside.

22:31:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And it's more the job of the SDC to encourage combat, not do all of the combat for the alliance."

22:32:24 A man in syrup-splattered blue coveralls gets up from his table and stumbles outside.

22:32:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that makes sense."

22:32:36 You hear Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.

22:32:41 You hear Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.

22:32:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll need to start organizing our own defenses more seriously."

22:33:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:33:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hi johann, sorry about that message."

22:33:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:33:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:33:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Yeah and then some right?"

22:33:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "In order to do that, we'll need to improve our skills in space combat."

22:33:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true."

22:33:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:33:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh weird you know what I guess we didn't use a part form you all."

22:33:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking I would do missions every day and encourage people to come along."

22:33:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Which, I had a plan for, until I was removed."

22:33:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah you did."

22:34:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know there weren't a lot of people participating, but I think doing all those fighter beacons made me a much better pilot."

22:34:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So that was good."

22:34:24 Several men suddenly start singing the Nouveau Quebec national anthem, their words slurred. After only a few bars they stop and pound the table, laughing uproariously.

22:34:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:34:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Missions are hard to get people to come along on. It's possible, but people want to do the high strength. Which are tough."

22:34:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:34:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'yeah it's pretty simple as it has transmitter, core and battery and I guess we used one of Nicolette's. I'c recommend we use a core from you all in the future or a battery."

22:35:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:35:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah as there's no income realized so it wouldn't benefit Nicolette."

22:35:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, Eva actually did a beacon in her fighter. Something I haven't seen in a very very long time."

22:35:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:35:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Right."

22:35:24 The bartender takes a cloth from his shoulder and quietly cleans the wooden bar.

22:35:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So, you know what? In my mind, it was going to be a success."

22:35:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah!"

22:35:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:35:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'yep I provided the Transmitter from SEAS and I think I just bought the battery for that one."

22:36:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I could still honor the terms of the contest."

22:36:23 The cook and the bartender share a laugh and then get back to work, speaking quietly to each other in French.

22:36:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That way Eva would be in the lead with 1, and maybe people would feel like doing 1 or 2 to try to win."

22:36:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:36:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok then also ifever you need modules from us, do call upon Constantine."

22:36:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her metallic gold touch einrophone:

22:36:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is if we're not around."

22:36:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's up to you now. It's your office now."

22:47:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If it's that letter, I already got it from elsewhere."

Subject: Temporary Scooping Station - Olivia's Pearl
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 20:59 22 July 2317 GST
--
Hello everyone,
I will start posting Temporary Stations Parts lists for the Temporary Space Stations which we either maintain or rotate to maintain.
The first Temporary Station is our Scooping Station in Olivia's Pearl. We are very close to that next level of Scoop which is the Advanced Passive Hydrogen Scoop . however it requires 1000 Command and we're not quite there. I'm certain that we will achieve this goal by the time the next Scooping station goes offline.
The Scoop is a valuable resource to SEAS as it typically yields 8 or more Command plus the current improved Scoop yields 3 Megacredits per day. So after 16 days, we earn 48 Megacredits and at least 8 Command. The cost of modules to build the Scooping station is currently 13 Megacredits and the next one, depending upon which ejecter is purchased, will cost up to 16 Megacredits. I have been using the Storage Container Unmanned Pickup which does not deliver Command or Megacredits until the station goes offline I think. It's hard to determine this as Command seems to accrue when you least expect it as we have a number of sources of Command and Megacredit income.
At 1000 Command, we will be eligible to obtain the Storage Container Daily Pickup which yields daily pickup of the Storage Module so instead of receiving our Command and Megacredits in one sum at the demise of the station, we would receive 4 Megacredits per day or depending upon the level of the Scoop, more than 4 Megacredits per day and some portion of a command point. Since we have a fairly good balance of Megacredits, there really is no current need to spend 3 Megacredits on the Daily pickup ejecter versus the Unmanned pickup but if you all prefer different, then we can go for the Daily pickup.
The Scooping station is solar powered and is placed in Olivia's Pearl. It typically has a life span of approximately 16 days so once a Scooping station is up, we would want to check the Range office in a couple of weeks to ascertain when it will be going offline.
I typically build the Scooping and the majority of Temporary Space Stations in the Constructor which belongs to me. I will likely obtain one for SEAS at some point within six months and will be obtaining some extra modules as well.
The parts list for the Scooping station in Olivia's Peral is as follows --
Top - Basic Control Center (cost is 1 Megacredit)
Core - Core (cost is 1 Megacredit)
Scoop- Improved Passive Hydrogen Scoop (cost is 4 Megacredits)
Ejecter - Storage Container Unmanned Pickup (cost is 1 Megacredit)
Power Plant - Solar Panel Array (cost is 6 Megacredits)
Note - the Solar Panel Array costs 6 Megacredits versus a Large precharged Battery which costs 8 Megacredits.
Special Notes -
23:01:59  we can't replace the current Scooping station until the current one goes offline as only one Scoop per organization is allowed to be in operation at one time.
concerning how to construct this particular Temporary Space Station or anything concerning construction of Temporary Space Stations in general, please seekout either myself or Shule.
