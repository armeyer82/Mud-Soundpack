Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!
This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However,
we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make
sure everyone gets a gift!
First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within
the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and
celebration a little closer to the holiday!
Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes
for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that
already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action
figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos, custom hair styles, small "plastic
surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest
selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details
for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much,
please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to
add additional lines of text!
Thank you!
   Announced 2 days, 20 hours, and 43 minutes ago

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and
an insulated red sleeping bag here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on an insulated red sleeping bag.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
