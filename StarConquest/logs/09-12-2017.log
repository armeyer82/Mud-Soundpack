00:04:19 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:04:19 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

00:28:14 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we're not even on the board! Let's do some piloting!"

00:28:20 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's so quiet. It's almost like everyone is far away from here, working in a super lucrative op. It sure is a shame that the Union president doesn't want to address things so his pilots could be out there working in it."

00:29:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh well, it's not like it's going to bring in billions and billions of credits."

00:29:45 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Not everybody's out there."

00:30:02 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I know. But a lot of folks are."

00:30:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Indeed."

00:30:22 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You'd think that Best would want to put an end to this so his pilots would be out there too."

00:30:24 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I usually miss most of the ops, so I thought I was better staying here."

00:30:37 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Who knows what that guy wants."

00:31:05 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "He probably doesn't want the ore because it's been too close to unregs."

00:31:18 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Unreg cooties?"

00:31:19 [General Communication] Damien Alexander chuckles.

00:33:49 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wow.. I just remembered."

00:34:36 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Er, the, waht? That sounds all kinds of wrong."

00:34:37 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Meatdog man, meatdogs!"

00:35:01 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "A fantastic unreg version of a hotdog."

00:35:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I know what they are, they are awesome, but, the hook up?"

00:35:21 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

00:35:27 [General Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

00:35:29 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "They sell those at Andy's, an'... Farport?"

00:35:38 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs. "I put them on our menu so that union folks could enjoy them."

00:35:46 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think she said her org put them on her mess hall menu."

00:35:47 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nice."

00:35:52 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, but I can't go get them from those places."

00:36:25 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Talking of meat dog hook ups, let me get this grapple working."

00:36:33 [General Communication] Eli Grey laughs.

00:37:20 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh man, they've got meat dog with mustard filling and meatdog wrapped in another meatdog. Excellent."

00:39:05 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I mean really.. the mustard is inside the meat dog. How are you not excited about this."

00:39:10 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Damn, 12 metres seems a bit short these days."

00:39:13 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's glorious, isn't it?"

00:39:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Um."

00:39:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chortles.

00:39:56 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh good, these are 16 at least."

00:40:00 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You having a size complex, ted?"

00:40:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

00:40:18 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Whoa, you found the 16 meter meatdogs?"

00:40:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

00:40:40 [General Communication] Angel Martin giggles.

00:40:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nobody could eat that much."

00:41:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I was about to say fuck me, there's an Angel, then I realised how that would go with the current conversation."

00:41:22 [General Communication] Eli Grey chuckles.

00:41:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's Angel! Hello Angel."

01:00:11 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not sure it's having much effect, but then again, I haven't been around much for the last week or so."

01:03:48 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think they think if they ingore it,  that we'll give up. But there's no way that they're not noticing the lack of us at those ops out there."

01:06:06 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles. "It's amusing getting double rift weather at the moment."

01:06:18 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Wait what?"

01:06:28 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "There's two weather stations."

01:54:47 You exclaim, "Hi my love!"

01:55:10 "Hi love!" Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

01:55:25 You're already sitting.

01:55:47 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in a dark green leather captain's chair and goes to sleep.

02:27:32 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:27:34 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:28:02 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I am spending most of my energy and creative powers striving to be as lazy as possible."

02:28:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "No one is doing anything? Someone must have an idea!"

02:33:07 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:36:56 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Nonfringies."

02:37:22 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Lexies."

02:37:31 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Greetings."

02:38:43 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Sup."

02:38:55 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Not a lot just being friendly."

02:50:23 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "That was a really long interview."

02:50:35 [General Communication] Eli Grey laughs.

02:50:53 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes, it was. I've heard bits of it, but I didn't have the concentration for the whole thing."

02:51:07 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I only barely did."

02:51:16 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "The Iliad? Beowulf? Or Eli's recitation of the ills of the universe?"

02:51:29 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I like how Ather keeps going like, "yes, yes, I'm getting to that""

02:51:41 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "He was pushy, man."

02:51:48 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well.... He will get to it."

02:52:07 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I eventually did! There was not a single question he asked that I didn't answer."

02:52:58 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I love watching newscasters twist words and push in certain directions."

02:53:16 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "That at least, hasn't changed in over 300 years."

02:53:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, we can't really expect less. News casters, like anyone else have the same predjudices against civilian pilots. Angus was reasonably decent though."

02:53:40 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "And what do you mean by the media twists things? Are you insinuating that the media tries to manipulate public perception of pseudofactual events for the profit of the power elite?"

02:54:05 [General Communication] "How could anyone do that?" Eli Grey gasps.

02:54:14 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "That was too intelligently said. I got nothing."

02:54:19 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right?"

02:54:31 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm just saying, the media has their interests, they always have. And ather, you're right. He was better than other newscasters."

02:54:52 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I honestly expected to get trounced."

02:55:15 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Knowing how the media treats us, I was expecting the same."

02:55:29 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Translation for the masses. The media make shit up, manipulate the public's perception of it, to serve those in power and with vested interests in said event."

02:55:42 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "He was relatively subtle, at least after the whole felo thing, and chose his moments carefully."

02:55:43 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Or, to serve themselves."

02:56:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Since they are part of the power elite. Yes."

02:56:24 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, the whole felo thing. And people still don't understand why I dislike them so much after what happened on New Earth."

02:56:45 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "What are these merry band ships doing?"

02:56:56 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably something nefarious."

02:56:57 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Stuff we'd rather they didn't."

02:56:59 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They're more likely planning their next theft."

02:57:22 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Feel free to open fire, as long as you're not within Mutuality borders. In fact, I encourage it!"

02:57:31 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Unless they're in Mutuality space, then they're probably just patrolling."

02:57:31 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "But Ather, the felo are so cute and cuddly! Especially when they've latched onto your arm!"

02:57:42 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fucking adorable."

02:57:47 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I heard they were pirates, so i've been paying special attention when I see them on flight control. Any ideas on what sector they could've jumped to from the museum? It's been one of their favorites recently."

02:57:47 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If you're not comfortable doing that. At least warn them out of the sector."

02:58:16 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "One of the league salvaging spots."

02:58:19 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably Clarkson's Push, or Masterson's Bend, or one of the adjacent beacons."

02:58:31 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Probably salvaging along the league's corridors along where they said."

02:58:56 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "They've been hitting the Tesla corridor a lot too."

02:59:19 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Any idea where I could go to learn more about intersector geography. I know relatively little, even after my training."

02:59:21 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's a shame we can't fine-tune our interdiction technology to keep the medium transports in the sector so we can destroy them, too."

02:59:33 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Beacons book. Space market."

02:59:36 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There is a beacon handbook on the market, I believe."

02:59:44 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Thanks."

03:00:47 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Go get 'em James. Be advised though. I fyou fire on a transport it will jump out and call in backup."

03:01:12 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "There not in the two places that were mentioned over general. They either jumped out, or went somewhere else."

03:01:19 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yeah, be ready to run like hell if you're not careful."

03:01:34 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Check your jump destinations, there should be a couple of numbered beacons around there."

03:01:41 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There's a whole string of beacons along that line. Go get that book that's my suggestion."

03:01:41 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'll keep that in mind."

03:02:45 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm going to get that beacon book, and read it to."

03:02:53 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Do both."

03:03:10 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "If you ever want to go after the pirates, I'd be happy to join you."

03:03:58 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I always see them when I'm not in a good ship to pursue it. I usually warn them off unless I'm in something where I have control of my weapons from the control room. I'm not acrobatic or talented enough to run between two rooms and fire and fly and engineer all at the same times."

03:04:20 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I know what you mean. I've practiced with the cruiser simulator on AFW Command."

03:04:25 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "This is grandly useful skill to possess."

03:04:25 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Thinking about Kelsey gives me headaches."

03:04:45 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, I wouldn't necessarily recomend doing it on a cruiser."

03:05:23 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well, I didn't know better, and it did give me a feeling for what that would be like, and why it isn't wise to do something like that in a cruiser."

03:16:40 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I can head over myself. What're you in?"

03:16:47 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Fringe 1.5."

03:16:56 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm also in fringe, tier 1."

03:16:58 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Hmmm."

03:17:11 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yeah, not ideal."

03:20:36 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "You bet they're headed to deal with pirates?"

03:20:55 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Remind me, other people who know better. Is tier 1 to 2 Tesla doable without a League?"

03:21:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

03:21:14 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Depends on what suits you're taking."

03:21:33 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It is but it hurts like a mother. I did it with a fringe 1.5 and a AEU 1 but we popped and it took us two runs to do the squad leader."

03:21:48 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Pirate transport in orion."

03:22:00 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Understood. Shoulder, or belt?"

03:22:07 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Belt."

03:22:08 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Current outline would be Fringe 1, Fringe 1.5, and Rental 2."

03:22:22 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Iffy but possible."

03:22:24 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "On the way."

11:52:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

11:52:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:52:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine."

11:53:04 The ship is already moving.

11:53:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:53:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:53:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:53:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

11:53:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:53:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:53:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:53:13 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

11:57:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

11:57:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:57:52 The ship is already moving.

11:57:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:58:01 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:58:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:58:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:58:04 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

13:16:22 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:16:22 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

13:28:15 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

13:28:16 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:28:16 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

13:28:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:28:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:28:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:28:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:28:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:28:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:28:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Providence Gate. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:28:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:28:36 There appear to be about 4 pilots recently active.

13:28:36 The communicator network detects:
Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident  (A) [m]

13:28:37 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

13:28:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:28:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:28:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:28:43 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Providence Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

13:28:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

13:29:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:29:27 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:29:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

13:29:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:29:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:29:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:29:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

14:03:14 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

14:03:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

17:42:09 Tanny Hill does not seem to have an active communicator.

17:42:31  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a stormy pair of trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

17:42:31 You are carrying nothing.

21:45:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Do we need reactors?"

21:45:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Cool. I think we do. And I didn't see any autonav sides. Only tops."

21:46:00 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay."

21:46:06 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I'll go back then."

21:46:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I might have just not seen them, but I only saw tops."

21:46:59 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It'll mean double charge stations out there for a while, but I think it's worth it to get this watchtower up. It'll all even out in the end."

21:48:25 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Two reactors."

21:48:51 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That'll be fine for now. Now give me autonav sides, mighty Mel."

21:50:41 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Done, cats got those."

21:51:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks Mel. I will build this later today."

21:51:23 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I need to see if I've anything going down."

21:51:52 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Morris took care of quite a few things."

21:52:28 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "%/[m<)ut)]>u)ti_*we land, [e:#`(' /TA is>3)}(>nu}es?"

21:55:25 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Doesthe felo place on hyperion take pets?"

21:55:43 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Getting rid of your pets?"

21:56:15 [General Communication] "It seems so." Evenia Callseah sighs. "I can't figure out what's going on. I'm leaving it to Johann."

21:56:33 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Going to be gone more then the caretaking task can handle."

21:56:58 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Everything all right Sean?"

21:57:51 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "Things will be fine."

21:58:34 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth Orbit flight control, this is New Earth, an AEU shuttle is about to land."

21:59:12 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Are you still going out to Andy's?"

21:59:20 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "No."

22:02:59 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'm sure there are people out there who wouldn't mind a second-hand pet."

22:03:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'd take his pets if he really didn't want them. Well at least one of them."

22:04:44 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles. "If I took more than one my ship would probably attack me in protest."

22:06:26 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'd give them to new pilots who want one but can't necessarily afford them on their own."

22:06:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Maybe. But then if something happened to that pet because they went away...yeah."

22:07:30 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "True."

22:10:13 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I should be back to put this Orion accelerator up but it's all set up on my transport if not."

22:10:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sure thing Mel. I'll handle it if you aren't."

22:10:57 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Capital beacon on it, right?"

22:11:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah giggles.

22:11:04 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

22:11:33 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Hello, for now. Missed anything good over the last few days?"

22:12:13 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah. Nothing amazing."

22:12:51 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nothing much, except that humanity joined the IFS and we finaly defeated the Outsiders with our combined might."

22:12:59 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "As if."

22:13:00 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Also, we all read minds now."

22:13:07 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Hooray!"

22:13:22 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "My conversation with the IFS must have paid off the other day."

22:13:36 [Hyperwave Relay] Unknown Contact 224524683 at South and Very Slightly Up from the Torus relay transmits, "This is Morris, just checking in to see if folks have made it back yet and are ok."

22:13:36 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Sadly the AEU sided with the Outsiders and was nearly destroyed."

22:13:46 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Maybe that's why we had some really pissed off outsiders visit us."

22:13:54 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "We're making a movie about it, it's gonna be great."

22:13:58 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Glad I'm not the only one that tries to talk to IFs, though I haven't don eit a while."

22:14:18 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I had an aeries sitting on me last time I went to build 002."

22:14:18 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I've done it before."

22:14:41 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anybody need anything else?"

22:14:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sitting on you? That's a bit cuddly, isn't it?"

22:14:57 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It sure would be a boon if we could convince them that we're not thralls anymore."

22:15:23 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I don't think so Mel. But thanks again. I'll do a great job. Spread the word!"

22:15:24 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I told them Outsiders suck and they were lying to them, but who knows."

22:18:04 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Ather and Eli are also definitely making a movie."

22:18:07 [Hyperwave Relay] Damien Goss transmits, "We're almost home Morris. Sorry about your ship."

22:19:27 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I think you have to do that from the relay station. I can do it though, I'm already there."

22:19:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Goss...I don't think we put a relay on that station, so you'll have to go yell at him from the hypercaster."

22:20:00 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Or it would go through if the Torus was activated, hence why I tried cause I didn't know if it was rented for this time period."

22:20:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Valid point. I forgot the obvious."

22:20:28 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Message relayed."

22:20:35 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Thanks."

22:21:07 [Hyperwave Relay] Unknown Contact 224524683 at South and Very Slightly Up from the Torus relay transmits, "Tell him don't worry about it. Warships are meant to be there to defend other ships. Too bad they couldn't save his transport. So far no one here is wanting to go home. Wendy says she'll stay."

22:22:33 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 205,023.55 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

22:23:47 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Are any of you planning to go back?"

22:23:51 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes."

22:23:57 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Yes."

22:24:09 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Yep."

22:24:12 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Just to retrieve my ships."

22:24:16 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've heard about the salvage opp."

22:25:58 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Should I tell them when they should expect y'all back?"

22:26:12 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Five hours give or take."

22:26:24 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Probably 90 minutes for me."

22:27:50 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Did you all see any allied pirates out there?"

22:28:17 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "I have not, but I haven't been out there much."

22:28:49 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Pretty sure we saw some Lambdas once at least."

22:28:58 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean the merry band people."

22:29:07 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Oh, no, not that I saw."

22:29:56 [Hyperwave Relay] Unknown Contact 224524683 at South and Very Slightly Up from the Torus relay transmits, "Ok. Is Mel bringin the other folks back or Goss?"

22:29:58 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I have a political question about the merry band. Are they officially protected by the mutuality? And if so, does the league's alliance with the mutuality council effect our policy towards these pirates?"

22:30:16 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Tanny, if you are still there, let them know Goss is bringing us back."

22:30:20 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Tanny, it's gonna take Goss 5 hours to get out there."

22:30:26 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Not that he is leaving in 5."

22:31:10 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I don't think protection is what you'd call it."

22:31:39 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Then, what's the more appropriate term for the relationship between the mutuality council and the merry band?"

22:31:42 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "They said they'd abide by the free port doctrine and the mutuality said okay good."

22:31:43 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Oh I see."

22:32:14 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Isn't Kelsey part of the Tandem Pact now?"

22:32:16 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Mutuality is just part of the Tandem Pact. Mutuality isn't the boss of everything."

22:32:35 Not much to see out there.

22:32:39 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Not that I'd mind it."

22:33:10 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Not what I meant in my question, it's just that yesterday someone said they were fare game to shoot at unless they were in mutuality space."

22:33:38 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "If that's your relations with them, then whatever."

22:34:01 [Hyperwave Relay] Unknown Contact 224524683 at South and Very Slightly Up from the Torus relay transmits, "Got it. Thanks. Things ok back home?"

22:34:50 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "And yeah don't shoot them if they're in our space, that's bad because they belong there and a lot of other people would get mad."

22:35:29 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Understood. I just wouldn't want to do anything to jeopardize my alliance's alliances."

22:35:52 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean, I'm not telling you what to do but incidents like that can get bad."

22:36:48 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "But anyway, if somebody shoots at you, you have the right to defend yourself."

22:37:06 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I've seen them jumping around in League space, and even warned them away from orion once yesterday. They seem to like salvaging."

22:37:17 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Yeah they do that."

22:37:24 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Even pirates need resources."

22:37:36 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Salvaging isn't bad."

22:37:59 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I mean it's not aggressive."

22:38:00 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Nah it isn't, but I'm always curious when I see known pirates jumping around through my alliance's space."

22:38:20 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "They do it everywhere."

22:38:25 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Pretty cocky."

22:38:55 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So this is probably not as funny as I thought it was, but one time Ijumped into Farport and the guys were like "We're under attack!" And it was just a pirate transport breaking up a chunk."

22:38:57 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Well, you know what I meant, I'm not claiming the presidency or anything. I've just noticed them more on flight control in league space than anywhere else."

22:39:19 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "You would if you have your scanner tuned to your alliance only."

22:39:20 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Hey Eli, I heard something like that on the scanner once."

22:39:23 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yeah they're fucking taunting us."

22:39:59 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "My scanner picks up everything, from fringe to league to eaos to aeu, and still when I have it on, I mainly notice the merry band in league space. I guess I never have it on at the right times."

22:40:07 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Well transports aren't aggressive, that's all I can say, they're just doing some work."

22:40:23 You scramble to your feet.

You can go north, south, west, and down.

22:40:28 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

22:40:28 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

22:40:34 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods north.

22:40:35 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

22:41:15 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Besides I know you all have a fighty relationship with the allied pirates, but they actually have helped the alliances at times. I mean it's complicated."

22:41:15 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:41:18 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

22:42:19 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yeah, but they're clearly rubbing their tandem pact status in our face."

22:43:35 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Hello? Anyone there?"

22:43:54 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Seems kinda like it, like whenever I go to an AEU planet I think okay, who am I gonna piss off over here, but I go anyway."

22:44:05 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Or I did until Aisling got attacked over there."

22:45:01 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "That was a load of shit."

22:45:29 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I bet they wouldn't have a go at her if it was one on one."

22:45:39 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They were doing htat before the Tandem pact thing though."

22:45:45 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The pirates, I mean."

22:45:56 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Yeah."

22:47:08 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And no, they would not have likely gone one on one with Aisling, not if they knew what was good for 'em anyways. That's why they just stood back and threw rocks like cowards."

22:47:31 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Eli, how's it going?"

22:47:44 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Hey Eli did you get my credit chip?"

22:47:52 [General Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "Going as well as can be expected."

22:47:56 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes I did."

22:48:13 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And on behalf of the citizens of the Union, I thank you as well as all who donated."

22:48:21 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Welcome."

22:49:21 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What did they donate for?"

22:50:59 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "So, maybe a stupid question, but can someone tell me the difference between hyperwave broadcasters and quantum linked entanglement communicators?"

22:51:25 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Not stupid, one is text based, the Quantum link one is, it can go further than a hyperwave broadcast can."

22:52:09 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "The Hyperwave has a limited range, but can go pretty far, the QED can go anywhere without needing to be directed, it just,  works, the hyperwave communication need to be boosted and directed where to go, or the ywon't reach the target."

22:53:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Think of the qe as like...The way to make contact with a ship anywhere. the hyperwave is a bit of a convenience, because you can talk directly to ships or stations if they're close enough. A qe message takes ages, because each character takes a while to send."

22:54:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "For example: sending even the code H4, takes like 2 minutes."

22:54:58 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "The QE takes forever as well, so messages need to be shortened down as much as possible. Th Hyperwave lets you communicate past communications range and pretty far, but it can be intercepted by anyone with the tech to recieve them too, but it's more or less instant, so no need to shorten messages."

22:56:05 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "What would you say the tr g I know about the intercepted part, I can hear moris's side of his comms from the salvage opp, I think just on my ftl comm without trying."

22:57:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That's because what you're hearing, is being bounced back by the torus hypercaster. It's the big mama hypercaster that can reach further than anything we can build."

22:58:00 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "How does someone use it?"

22:58:43 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The one on the torus can only be used when it's being rented by an org. Or at least. Aimed at that time. But when it's being used. Anything you say over your comms hyperwave frequency will be heard."

22:59:42 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "And the stuff i'm not hearing? Is that hypercasters from ships or temp stations?"

23:00:09 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "The stuff you aren't hearing is from the Hyperwave station aimed away from the relay, likely."

23:00:28 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Right now, you're only hearing one side of the conversation because they're using a temp station hypercaster."

23:03:47 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sorry for the slow response Cheri, I couldn't get to my communicator. While folks were out protesting they heard about a problem with less fortunate citizens not having access to medical creches. They spontaneously busted out into a fit of donations to help."

23:04:29 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Haha, nice."

23:04:29 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Stuff like that gives me hope for humanity."

23:05:12 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It was like a donation flood. We all started tossing credits at Eli."

23:05:45 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Has it increased at all since yesterday's update Eli?"

23:05:54 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's like get these people some creches, shit."

23:06:11 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We've got miracle healing beds, let folks use 'em."

23:06:42 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That was kinda how it went. We had people running to machines to exchange credits, and donations flying."

23:10:41 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And of course the Patriots have only made it more expensive by reducing the government subsidies."

23:11:27 [General Communication] Eli transmits sarcastically "You know, because they care about the citizens oh so much."

23:11:48 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Reformers live in houses just as big as they can afford."

23:12:17 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yeh, sounds like just as big as they can afford with public funds."

23:18:26 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:18:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small hot coffee dispenser here.

23:18:35 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:18:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:28:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:28:00 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:28:02 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:28:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:28:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

Enter your selection:

23:28:22 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:28:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:28:23 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:28:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:28:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:28:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:28:29 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
