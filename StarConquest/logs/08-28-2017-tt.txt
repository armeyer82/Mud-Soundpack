Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.

the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.

Dear Mr. Elemmire,
Recently, you applied to Telex Defense Incorporated's Special Orders Department
seeking permission to purchase and operate a T6-09 Telex Defense Inc.
Pincer-Class Forward Assault Frigate. Your application was analyzed by our
finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your service as a
pilot.
Unfortunately, at the conclusion of this process, we reached the decision that
we could not accept your application at this time.
You are welcome to re-apply at the beginning of the next six week civilian
liaison term. If you choose to do so, we will take your new application
responses into account along with any new additions to your pilot record that
have occurred in the intervening time.
Until then, please accept our condolences and find enclosed one coupon for a
free small Rickety Rick's Spacey Cheesey Fries.
Sincerely,
Telex Defense Incorporated's Special Orders Department

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, he knows
about the ship for sure. He was talking to me about it earlier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I wont lie
that im curious about what kind of ship it is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He didn't
claim it, because he was pretty mad at what they were implying."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I would be
too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's
apparently a fighter called,  of course, the Patriot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That's..
kind of amusing. I'd be even more amused if it was only for those deigned to be
patriots."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It was
awarded to him specifically for his supposed tips about lambeth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Apparently
they are pushing Lambeth out, I have no idea who his replacement is supposed to
be yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They are
shifting the blame for tensions with the Mutuality for Lambeth and the QSA
thing. They claim the flotilla has nothing to do with it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Politics annoy
me, even though its one of the things I studied a lot growing up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Their quite
frustrating. I honestly didn't know much before any of this. I've had a bit of a
crash course over the last few months."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You seem to be
doing well despite that."

hear you say that, I've made quite a few mistakes, so it's good to hear that
folks still think i'm doign alright."

Constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Now I'm
worried they'll do more than just fire Mr. Lambeth."

mess."

back to the flock."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey
Tara."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It'll be
alright constantine."

help, I'll do what I can, Con."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hm,
okay, actually I was thinking that we three patriots should be the ones to
retrieve the proposal results."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys
can witness it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just so
that they don't suspect tampering."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "By
'unpatriotic' elements."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you
guys are amenable to that idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I'm cool with
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Tough
I'd like to do it later today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone coughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay,
great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It needs to
be up for 24 hours anyways, I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You might want
to check the terminal for tampering though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Since if there
was headline about things on your terminal.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No,
there's no tampering there. I'm afraid they just used some statements I made to
serve their own ends, in this case."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though
which ones, I'm not entirely sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're very
good at that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
think I've ever discussed unregs on the terminal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd be glad
to be there if I'm available."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well you
discussed Mutuality and they're unregs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're a
recognized alliance, but they're also still considered unregs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
but I didn't really connect them to Lambeth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess
I did say the meeting he presided over didn't provide any satisfactory results."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And the
meeting was about unregs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I
guess in a sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Dots
could be connected."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That wasn't
his fault either though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I
meant our meeting discussing it with him, not the actual meeting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I believe it,
I once saw the news twist someone praising the navy into them saying we could do
without them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They said
somethin glike "We could not have done it without the navy, and the news just
took out certain words so that it said "We could do without the navy""

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They'll
take what they want to get their message out, I guess."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess
there's probably no harm in checking out that fighter, since it's already in the
news anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You're call
though, bud."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah,
I'll take a look at it in a bit."

official for being a dirty unregistered sympathizer, glorious patriot Stone?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He's a pretty nice
guy."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "If he is kind to
unregistered people I would assume so."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So who was it?"
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Our former
liaison."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I suppose it was only a
matter of time for him based on what I was told."

Main according to him."

Vernos."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, like the
government Liaison."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Andrew Lambeth."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Huh, nice guy."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Well, just proof that if you
are friendly to unregistered people in the AEU, you get punished."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "As if there was any
questions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'd love to see it
some time or did you blow it up to spit in his face?"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "He was also quite responsive
during the slave trading business, so he's obviously a decent guy."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Be proud, glorious patriots
of the AEU. Be proud."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
haven't blown it up, I haven't looked at it yet either."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Which goes to show what sort of
people his opposition is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll
find you next time I see you on comms and you can have a look."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Be sure to
put a plaque on it, displaying how you truly feel for Best and then continue to
turn away merchants and picket in it. Or just blow it up. Or do whatever."

credit for it's debris after you blow it up."

nightmare about once."

[General Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Somebody once taught
me, an appropriate response for this is "No, really?"."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Or twice, or a bunch of times.

hiding?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Holy shit you're alive."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I was going to ask you
kindly. If you could put a BAS on joyride for me. I thought there might be one
on cats spare parts. But alas. No stupid rush. But the BAS goes down in like a
day or so."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Sounds like a person who
disappears for months at a time and leaves ships full of felo to die, stinking
up the old Earth garage in the process."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I oh hell. Oh, just oh hell.
Well, I've pretty much convinced myself that I may never have another creature
again except maybe fish, maybe, because I've been traumatized by them dying one
too many times."

forgot to get the bas. I guarantee you she'll be fine with it. Cats always
provides the...well, BAS for the bas. But I don't see one anywhere."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "So I wound up leaving because I
convinced myself that I was too irresponsible to be good for anything, went in
to this really horrible self destructive spiral that I'll spare you the details
of, wound up in counseling because I went to turn in my license and I think I
put somethign really embarrassing as the reason why, and... though I'm not
necessarily convinced I'm all right, I've been convinced to try living again.
And living, for me, had involved flying for years."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "No worries, I'll be heading over
that way in a little while and will put one on there."

goes having best twist your every word?"
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "The erratic? Unpredictable?
Erm..."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Nicolette believe me. I've beat
myself up about everything for over a year. I tried to walk off a cliff at some
point over New Year's. I'm pretty sure someone who does that as a reaction to
their own irresponsibility knows how bad they are, or can be. Though I'm not
asking for any sympathy over that believe me, it was pretty ridiculous, now I'm
just trying to figure out where I fit and what I can be trusted to do again and
hopefully, something good will come of it."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Though, I'm in no position to do
anything like that again, thankfully."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm...Ur, not quite sure of
the history here. But I'm going to guess you starved a bunch of beautiful
animals to death?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I also don't know you. Just,
going on the current topic of conversation."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Let's be honest, half of
everyone's forgotten to feed felo at some point."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Forgetting to feed felo
doesn't include just walking away from them for months."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "On multiple occasions."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Knowing full well what
would happen to them."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Totally forgetting and then
fixing the situation as soon as you can is one thing Keegan, but...walking away
from them? that's starvation, last I checked."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Sounds like you're holding onto
some bitterness, which is just fine, but she's been gone for awhile and
immediately jumping on shit that happened probably close to a year ago at this
point doesn't help anyone."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "She's been gone for a
while, and the felo that died due to it are still dead. Sounds to me like
they're still holding on to it too."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm not jumping on anyone
for the record. I'm simply trying to understand."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Sounds like a missed
opportunity for some lovely Felo Meat Hamburgers."

felo."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Don't worry Scherzo, I do not
intend to cook you. You have a name."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There's the BAS module aboard."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks Emily. I promise if
Mel didn't intend us to have a BAS and I turn out being wrong about the module,
I will offer myself up for the slaughter."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Great, I'll sharpen the knives in
preparation."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm sure she just forgot
though, so it'll be fine."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It also gives me an excuse to
sign up for my salvage missions while I'm here, it's not bad motivation really."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Mmm. Salvage."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Quick. Cover your ears
Keegan. Turn down the communicator. We said salvage."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Only two loads a day, any more is
just decadence."

about making felo meat hamburgers."

merchants again?"
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "That don't sound appetizin'."

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No...No, it does not."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Next he'll start talking
about top of the line, spider meat pies."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Hmm, they've sent the letter H. I
wonder what it could all mean."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Sanity. That's...Just no."
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "He best stay away from my
spidies."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "The beacons
are still up, and the merchants don't have to listen to what we say. It was
never a matter of allowing them or not."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Spider meat pies?"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Spiders weave webs of intrigue."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "More like."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Spider Web Sammiches."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I say 'we',
but I wasn't involved. But that's the situation all the same."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's gonna say
either...hello, or hi."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "The Arachnopals had the right
idea, they produce some de-li-cious web."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "We also need some Brain of
Tardick Lizard."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "A delicacy."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I am no longer hungry. And
very tempted to throw up. You nasty. Nasty person."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "He's clearly doing it for effect,
and it worked."
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yup."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yes, hi."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Emily's got the right idea."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh no doubt. But if one of
us didn't let him think it was working, he wouldn't stop."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I have become predictable in my
old age."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz sighs.
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "That's okay Keegan, we still love
you."
[General Communication] Emily Ford coughs.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll help scrape the rust
from your hair sometime."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I use the word love in the most
generic and loosest possible way."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz chortles.
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "So much so that it's hard to tell
if it had any real meaning or significance in that sentence at all."
[General Communication] Emily Ford giggles.
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I like this job as communications
clerk, I get to sit on my rear end with a slice of toast and a cup of tea,
waiting for messages to finish coming in."

[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "They're saying hi to Rayne. I
guess I can leave now."

[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I drink the good old British
stuff from the lounge, though this tea from the Accord galley is pretty good.
It's strong enough that you just know it's tea."
Shine the big white glowing felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker.
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Unintentionally. I had things set
up so they'd be fed while I was gone for a week or so. I don't know what
happened while I was gone, either I miscalculated what would be needed, or I
gave a robot commands that inadvertently canceled its task, or the people I
asked didn't have keys I thought I'd gave them. The latter I could have asked
about, but when I started finding them dead I don't... something just
emotionally broke, I left the spaceport and wlaked blindly in the same direction
until I couldn't anymore. And after that, the rest is just too embarrassing to
recount. Though I've been though enough tests for people to be sure I'm not
going to do something crazy reckless and endanger me and others indirectly
because of emotional residue."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There's a message coming in for
you Rayne."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I ah... not to sound melodramatic
or anything but didn't figure anyone would want to say hi to me."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "My guess is, Mel's sending it."
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I don't know you. But hi."

tea from the coffee shop."

say on balance."

him twist my words is..."

to moderately bad."

feel bad for Mr. Lambeth."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I don't think I know you either,
but hi to you too."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But,
what I try to remember is that they're going to do what they want regardless,
and just find whatever justification they can wherever they can find it."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I'm the notorious and much hated
but also loved by some so it's confusing Rayne."
[General Communication] Rayne Song chuckles.

name."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Thanks."

toast."

on Accord."

[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I don't like starving felo
either, but don't take em too serious Rayne. There's actually two people guilty
of mass felo starvation in that conversation, but it's just one of em we're
supposed to forget about apparently."
[General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I don't think I could take care
of another creature for a while, I'd be so anxious the whole time. I think I'm
reacting more to being reminded of that anxiety than the thing doing the
reminding, honestly."

back?"

say in it."

about the bari vent cleaning."

I guess that would be covered by the strike."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
haven't even thought about it because mining is anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd argue
it's defense of home space against the bari."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green
leather captain's chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a dark green leather captain's chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark purple tee appliqued with small neon purple
flowers, a pair of navy blue jeans, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She
is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple
flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard
snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her
shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "What exactly do you
mean by that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I didn't
mean anything bad. The way you said kindly after you said thank you just
reminded me of the way some of the folks on the planet Telex talk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"Hyperion Rules."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah, I understand.
Well, as a matter of fact, since you put it that way, I was born there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, Hyperion
does rule Dakhal. But when you've stayed up way too late drinking Hyperion ale,
a good cup of Telexan coffee is a good way to shake the hangover."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Day
two of my binge shopping begins now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Eli!who vernos."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, I just meant, hi
Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Coffee is awesome. I

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think I may need
coffee too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But then again, I
think making money is a bit more important at present. I still have that loan to

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess ou

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, at the
risk of sounding like a woman here, shopping actualy is quite fun."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually, I
enjoy it more now than I did before I was a pilot. Something about only being
allowed in certain places gives shopping for things a sort of scavenger hunt
type quality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm gonna

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"When people talk of scooping, I get immensely sad."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can really get a
sense for the speed when you are down in an atmosphere like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We'll get you
a scoop soon Dakhal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "One
of my favorite activities that I won't be able to do for likely a very long
time."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "It's not bad, just takes
forever to fill up the hold. It's at least abreak from asteroid hauling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm just over here
salvaging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well if
you've done it before, doesn't that mean you already have a scoop?"
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I probably batter this
thing more than it needs to be, I go down as far as I can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It
was on my old cargo hauler and it was a really ineffective scoop. It got sold
when I turned the ship in."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what she said."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne chuckles.
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I just realized that before
you said it."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Considering the best Ican
filter is 1.44% and my overall load is 1.39 percent so far..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, that
sucks Dakhal. Maybe once folks realize what poor choices Best has amde, they'll
press for a proper delegation to be sent. Instead of leaving it up to us
civilians."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not that we
can't pull something like that off, but it's kinda hard when what they really
want is assurance from our government, not us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"Indeed. Mutuality is really pissed with the government though, so short of the
AEU selling themselves completely short, which won't happen with Best in charge,
I just don't see it happening."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"Also were you aware that the Hermes Star Liner has a docking bay?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, that's
just it, all the Mutuality really wants is an assurance that we won't attack.
They shouldn't have to offer much to make it happen."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And no, I was
not aware of that, how big is the bay?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ash
was just saying the other day what they wanted was something material. Of
course, they want assurances that the AEU won't attack, but they want more than
just that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"It's a 15 sizer. So it can fit a couple fighters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, but Ash
was wrong about that from the first meeting as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"Could put three of those awesome Hyperion fighters in the liner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She said they
would want technology, and yet the council specifically told the delegation that
they didn't want technology, they just want us not to attack them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The problem
is that even with civilian pilots sayinng they won't attack, we don't speak for
the whole government or the military, so they wouldn't accept those
reassurances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyways,
we'll figure it out soon enough."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Eli, you ever find your
coat yet?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Yes, it was mysteriously
returned to me."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The coat-thief must
have had a change of heart."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Well, that's good."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, thanks for asking.
It's my special coat that fills the wearer with all the powers of a coat."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "So warmth and comfort then.

[General Communication] Joel Kringle snickers.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green
leather captain's chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a dark green leather captain's chair.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, a
robotic chef named Nellie, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and a small red insulated cooler here.

[Public Access Studio]
You see a cream-colored chair, a cream-colored sofa, a small wooden end table, a
tridimensional holocamera, a cream-colored speakerphone, a sign reading "Call-in
Number: 1111-47612", and a backdrop projector here.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey, Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin, Patriot Constantine Stone,
and Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident are standing here.
You can go out.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey switches a backdrop projector to "AEU phoenix symbol."
Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin sits down on a cream-colored sofa.

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey stands before an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and looks into
the camera with a grim expression. He says, "Greetings once again fellow
citizens of the Union and to the rest of humanity that may be tuned in."
who cesar
I can't find someone with the name 'cesar'.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, ""We're here once again to talk to you about the
strike against Outccord, and the recent events surrounding it. As has been
stated over and over on these broadcasts, Outccord is a danger to the continued
existance of humanity. This alone is a good enough reason to bring the
negotiations to a full end.""
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "It's not, however the only reason. Citizens of the
Union, we seem to now have a leader who thinks he can do whatever he wants with
our alliance and it's people. He's continued to punish us and cast us aside for
simply disagreeing and offering alternatives. If the way the pilot corps has
been treated is any indicator for how the rest of the population is being
treated, then I truly pray for us all."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ather and I were rogued, for simply speaking our
opinion and assisting in the rescue of several innocent unreg families. Our
liaisons were removed from office and had their names dragged through the mud.
Other pilots were given commendations and praised in the presf, twisting their
words to make it seem like they support Best, in an attempt to turn us against
each other. Not once has a reasonable attempt at diplomacy been made by the
government to address these issues. Only attacks and misdirection. Much of this
could have been avoided had the government just acknowledged our concerns and
attempted to explain their sideing and offering alternatives. If the way the
pilot corps has been tr."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "The pilot corps have not been the only ones handled
this way. Senators Donovan and Bates of Hyperion are under investigation for
terrorism, for simply wanting to avoid future conflicts on the world they
represent. I believe representing their citizens is the very definition of their
job, something Best clearly doesn't know anything about. I wonder who will get
accused of terrorism next for saying something the president doesn't like?"
Eli's eyes flash angrily, "now they have even removed our beloved liaison Andrew
Lambeth from office. A fine example of a man who has always been there for the
corps. whether offering helpful advice, or a stern matter-of-fact warning,
mister Lambeth has always done an excellent job at guiding the corps in the
right direction. None of what has happened is Andrew lambeth's fault. Best is
using him as a scapegoat to hide the facts. they claim that it was the pilot
delegation sent to negotiate the QSA who have caused the recent tensions between
the Union and the Mutuality. so they're removing Lambeth to make some kind of
example out of him."on of their job, someth.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I think anyone who has been following the news knows
the real reason that tensions are so high. The Union flotilla that skirted the
Mutuality border has a lot to do with it. There was no one held accountable for
an entire flotilla being somewhere that it wasn't supposed to be. Combine that
with Best's current attempt to get out of the Accord, which restricts naval
movements to prevent such things, is enough to make anyone tense. A QSA meeting
that didn't come to a deal is pale by comparison. Perhaps if the QSA was so
important to Best he should have sent someone to begin with,  like the other
alliances did. No matter how you look at it, Best is the one to blame for the
tensions, plain an dsimple.on of their job, someth."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "These wreckless, selfish decisions must be stopped,
before they come down on all of our heads! The recent E. Danikin scandal only
proves this. He sent a man who was all ready to jump in his escape pod once
things went bad to negotiate for our future. It's been very apparent how
important Outccord is to president Best, often it seems as though it's all he
cares about. Yet this is who he sends to do it? Either Best knew about that
escape plan, or he didn't. Either one of those is unacceptable. Apparently he
couldn't be bothered to do some simple research on a man he was sending to pull
us out of humanity's only chance for salvation against our alien enemies. Unless
of course, it's the more sinister option. I won't speculate on those details,
what matters is this... How can we trust a president that seems to do whatever
he wants, no matter how hapazard it may be? especially when he insists on
ignoring and condemning any disagreement with his actions?on of their job,
someth."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The negotiations have only been put on hold because
of this. On hold. Best's only response to this has been to say that he would
find the greatest negotiator to make the greatest deal. Is this not what the
criteria for Danikin was as well? And will this new negotiator simply step in
and continue with what Danikin has already started? Something that Danikin
himself clearly thought was a bad enough idea to have planned a way out? This
madness has to end now!on of their job, someth."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Even if you don't care about Outccord at all, this
still concerns you. If we let this man get this foothold, he'll know that he can
do whatever he wants and that all he has to do is ignore any debate that
contradicts him. Don't wait until it's your turn to be ignored or made an
example out of. Best's wreckless decision making is going to bring disaster on
all of us. Don't let him take our union for himself, from right under our
noses."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "The strike will continue until Best is stopped. We
will continue to dissuade merchants from trading and will not bring any money
for the Union until Outccord is called off entirely. We have no confidence in
Best's decision making. Best's competency should be called into question. His
decisions should be reevaluated by all members of government. We simply can't
let him make such a dangerous choice for the Union. Simply put, Best does not
know best."
Eli takes a deep breath before continueing, "the pilot corps can see reason
however, despite our presidents unwillingness or inability to do so. Even with
this longer list of glaring complaints, we will end the strike if Outccord is
called off. Abandoning Outccord and agreeing to work with all members of
government to find a solution that does not involve leaving the Accord will end
the strike. That being said, I hope that members of all political parties have
taken notice of his actions during Outccord and have seen the kind of man, and
leader, that he really is."s.
The ripples on Eli's skin slow to their normal pace, having grown erratic during
the course of him speaking, "We have no more trust in Best at all. He wants to
pull our resources out of the Accord at a time when threats loom over every
horizon. the Accord is our only chance of staying safe from Outsiders, IFS, and
replicators. Just the other day a monitored swarm reached over two billion
units. Does the Union really not want to assist in protecting us all from such
threats? Outcord must be stopped. Best must be stopped."s.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "People watching out there, you're the the only ones
who can stop this. Whether you are against Outccord,  or you're for it, one
thing we can all agree on is that none of us asked for the Union to become one
man's plaything. Demand accountability, demand an end to Outccord. Help us all
find our way back to normalcy."
Eli glances over the other pilots, "do any of you have anything you would like
to add?
Patriot Constantine Stone clears his throat.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Patriot Constantine Stone.
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Merchant pilots, please don't do business in
Union ports."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Every credit spent or load of goods brought in
is more money in Best's pocket."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "And more fuel to the fire he's burning our
alliance down with."
Patriot Constantine Stone nods.
Eli nods solemnly to Constantine.
: nods solemnly.
Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident nods solemnly.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well unless anyone has anything else, I think we've
said what we came here to say."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Everyone out there watching, I hope you have heeded
these words. Do what you can to make your voices heard. May you all find peace
and joy in your lives..."
-shule, Lily, Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin, and Constantine come to stand next
to Eli, In unison, they thrust their fists into the air and exclaim, "for the
Union, the Accord, and humanity!"
Eli and the other pilots leave the studio, leaving an AEU phoenix symbol

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

thing that's gonna clear that station for good, is a plasma flood, which is very
expesnive and involves evactuating the station."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"That's comparable to saying that the RATS in space are only temporarily out of
the way, and we shouldn't worry about them due to that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "But
I'll respect your decision."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yup."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We are but
sEAS at least will continue to support temporary stations. After all, we're paid
in eAOS not aEU."

Lily."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "At least in
terms of Organization's income not personal income."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Erik this does
not concern you directly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can see why
you would see it that way, but this comes from professionals. The station was
dealing with the bari issue for a very long time without even the ability for us
to clean the vents. During that time we were assured that they were preventing
the bari from spreading."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm just pointing it out
because it seems you missed a memo."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, y'all all need to decide
if ya want your government benefittin from these stations. If so, then
contribute normally. If not, then don't. But Seas needs to sit down with Seekers
bout it...and it's somethin I ain't got no part in no more."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So shut the fuck up idiot."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He really irrittes me."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Irrittes."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Irritates."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Lily we can still provide
parts, but as it stands, the strike is still active."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

this with Melinda and thank you all for your input."

communicator with a click.
'I think Tara about hates his guts.
You say, "I think Tara about hates his guts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"That doesn't convince me that it's still not a concern. The Bari are a threat
no matter how "in control" they are, just as a legion of RATS is a threat as it
approaches our belts to reduce them to dust."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "As for what
Starseekers will do, I can't answr for them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I just said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "We will still
provide parts, but there is still a strike in effect."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah he is a jerk as is warbutt."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lily, y'all and Seekers need
to sit down and make a decision. I'm just tryin to get y'all together 'cause I
ain't the middle-man no more's all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh I agree

so as I say I will settle this with Mel and that's the only person I care to
discuss it with and she already knows what we're willing to contribute."
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Hello shule. How are you?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mel ain't in the AEU."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not at
all saying that we shouldn't worry about bari, or RATs, I'm just going off of
what the specialist on Frontier cluster told us in letters years ago."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "The f... ser... Do you not
listen?"
[General Communication] Angel Martin transmits, "Mel also isn't in seekers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wish I

it's work Eli and I am not doing work for now and for probably a long long
time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hopefully not
much longer."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It

A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins jerks his limbs, springing
into the air briefly.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright, so...
Here's the scoop. We will buy parts, but only after the strike ends. I don't
wnat to contribute to something that the government can get a hold of, Ok? Does
that work for you ma'am?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No
but you can do what you wish. The government can't get ahold of anything that is
aboard other ships."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Our
refusing to contribute only creates issues with relationships with other
alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You
could just try calling for a crew to clear the vents, whoever is interested in
that. I feel like I woke up and heard half a conversation."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But
if Kim told you to do this, then fine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Some
people don't mind doing it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Kim didn't say a
damn word, Lily."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Gah jus gfor fucks sakes this is her reason
and how lame is that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I was thrown
into this today like I was thrown into everything else. Kim didn't say one word.
I'm the only trustee who is here now. I rule till she decides to show. If you
really want, you can write her a letter. I don't care."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not
necessarily, they seem perfectly fine with goign without AEU parts for now. I
leave that up to temp station folks though. I've just been concentrating on
getting the pilots to join, not whole orgs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I'm
perfectly fine with the vents beign cleared, I just don' tthink any of the
strikers should do it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's
fine Evangeline. SEAS will contribute power plants to keep up a good faith
effort to support others then. We qualify for them so we'll be more than happy
to contribute to the benefit of other humanity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'm not going to
clear any vent till the strike is over. Hell I'm not doing any work till it is
over, so please, if you want to do what you want, then that's fine. Me? I'm
staying out of this bullshit. As for the parts, write Kim or do what I suggested
and stay out of it for now. I don't think the other alliances organizations,
rather, give a fuck what we do as long as we are still on strike."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There haha hope I put that snippy bitch in
her place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Do what you want
Lily. I'm working alone at the moment. When Kim comes around, I'll talk to her."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Wowzers,
okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not
telling anyone they have to clean the vents."
A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, I
mean and contributing to stations that don't make money shouldn't even be a
question. I think it's only credit making stations are in question at this
point."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was
just saying, it sounded like somebody wanted to, and you can probably get three
non AEU pilots to hepl."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
I refuse to lead a crew at this time. If you all do so, it's up to you but I
won't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes, we can
contribute to stations that don't make money, but nothing else. That sounds fair
enough, but I need a solid basis."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
contribute millions to stations which earn little or no money but money, althugh
I know how to earn it very well, doesn't control why I choose to help others."
tra 1 What it sounds like to me is that Starseekers is going to do what they
want and SEAS is not necessarily going to do the same thing. Let's just agree to
disagree. We have the right to choose what each of our respective orgs will or

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,

starseekers and sEAS."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's just a tolerance thing and it may

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It is so tempting."

Subject: AEU orgs and stations. Especially builders, please read.
Author: Melinda Michaels
Posted: 02:42 30 August 2317 GST
--
Until further notice from the orgs, Starseekers will not be participating in any
station that generates income. They will contribute to any station that does not
generate income such as the bubble.
However, Seas is willing to go ahead and purchase the batteries for any and all
income generating stations.
I have not yet received word from Invaders.
Please respect the choices of the orgs and take care to get the correct
batteries when you are building stations.
Thanks,
Melinda

atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One of the EMMs

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Star Conquest Help: Siege the Card Game
--
Two militarized outposts stand at opposite ends of a sector cluster. Each one
launches a tremendous fleet and goes forth to conquer. Which side will defeat
the other fleet and besiege the enemy outpost? Will the outpost then repel the
siege and manage to win the day, or will they be defeated? The object of Siege
is to find out.
Siege is played with a deck of cards, each card representing a participant in
the battle. Close range combatants, ranged combatants, tech users, siege
weapons, and various defenses are all represented. Each card has a specific
ability to attack, and also to defend against each kind of combatant. In play,
these abilities are used in a random roll of the dice to determine which card
wins the battle.
The game follows a specific sequence. First, each player draws 20 cards each,
and each player chooses 5 cards to defend his or her outpost. These cards cannot
be taken out again except at great expense. The first player then chooses a card
from his or her army to attack, and the second player chooses a card to defend.
Whoever wins this battle takes the next turn.
The game follows these basic rules for battles:
* Close range combatants (Outsiders) are effective against tech users.
* Ranged combatants (IFS) are effective against close range combatants.
* Tech users (Jinu) are effective against ranged combatants.
Siege cards are useful for attacking outposts because no one defends against
them well, but they can't be used in the open battle portion of the game.
Armor cards defend equally well against every sort of attack, but can't be used
to initiate battle.
Cards in the outpost can be taken out and played against the attacking fleet,
but this card will be at half effectiveness, and will also never again be
available to defend the outpost, even if it wins.
Once one fleet is defeated, the remaining fleet is besieging the enemy outpost.
If all of the cards in the outpost are defeated, then the defender loses. If, on
the other hand, the defenders in the outpost are successful in defeating the
besieging fleet, then the defender wins.
Defenders in an outpost get a bonus to all of their defense rolls.
Commands:
SIEGE to start a game.
JOIN for an opponent to join the game.
DRAW to draw a card; used each round.
STOP to end a game early.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
