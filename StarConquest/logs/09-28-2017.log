01:35:49 --

01:35:50 Lily:

This letter is an example of uncooperative behavior. So is the example you named. So are the issues Morris and Evenia and Melinda have communicated to me which I'm sure you're familiar with. But here's what it comes down to.

I don't report to you. No one except the people in your own org need to report to you. We're supposed to be in this together. This attitude you guys are stewing in has to change or you will continue to find yourselves isolated. Get out of the bubble you're in, talk to people, and clear the air. Otherwise nothing is going to change and I'll just wish you good luck with your solo endeavors.

01:35:59 Lily:

If you want to deal, let's set up a time to meet about it. I'll bring Melinda and you bring Shule or whoever. Going back and forth over mail isn't very practical.

01:36:37 You say, "Wow."

01:36:55 You say, "No idea why she's suddenly got a vendeta against us."

01:43:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly southeast.

01:50:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident scrambles to her feet.

01:50:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

01:50:25 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:53:55 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:53:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

01:54:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:54:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tugs a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes onto her feet.

01:55:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "I suppose we should go on over to Old Earth."

01:55:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We didn't specify where we would meet."

01:55:35 You say, "Oh, ok."

01:55:38 You nod.

01:55:45 There appear to be 18 pilots recently active.

01:56:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok it's about 5 minutes until midnight."

01:56:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:56:16 You nod.

01:56:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:56:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:56:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:56:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:56:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:56:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:56:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

01:56:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:56:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:56:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:56:41 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:56:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

01:56:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:56:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:56:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What direction is it from here to there?"

01:56:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:56:49 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

01:56:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I am not at liberty to say at the current time."

01:57:09 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:57:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Er.. good point."

01:57:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:57:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:57:23 You join Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's group.

01:57:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:57:29 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:57:29 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:57:30 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:57:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

01:57:45 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:57:46 I don't understand that.

01:57:49 You scramble to your feet.

01:57:49 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:57:51 You exit the ship.

01:57:51 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person medium transport "Procrastination" and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

01:57:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just went into the doorway to the pilot lounge.

01:57:59 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

01:58:01 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:58:01 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]
You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Melinda Michaels, Morris Corlew, Nissi Valdaire, Cheri Lindbergh, and Damien Goss are sitting on a cushy booth seat. Erik Goodwin is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair. Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go out.

01:58:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

01:58:09 Erik Goodwin nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:58:16 You wave.

01:58:23 Cheri Lindbergh waves to you.

01:58:23 Erik Goodwin says into his blue metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "So?"

01:58:26 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Hey."

01:58:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves and smiles at Cheri Lindbergh.

01:58:35 You wave and smile at Cheri Lindbergh.

01:58:38 Erik Goodwin says into his blue metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "But um."

01:58:43 Erik Goodwin says into his blue metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Actually never mind."

01:58:44 Morris Corlew stands up from a cushy booth seat.

01:59:01 Morris Corlew says, "Y'all enjoy the lounge. Wouldn't wanna start a war or nothin."

01:59:03 Morris Corlew just went into the stairway to the garage.

01:59:07 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Morris."

01:59:11 Cheri Lindbergh smirks.

01:59:15 A group a table over have a conversation about pilots from other alliances while rolling their eyes and shaking their heads.

01:59:30 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "First of all, stop that crap. Second, get back in here and sit down."

01:59:49 Erik Goodwin says into his blue metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Pretty sure you're already doing that."

02:00:01 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

02:00:02 Katina Faye just arrived.

02:00:04 Katina Faye sits down on a cushy booth seat.

02:00:07 Erik Goodwin waves to Katina Faye.

02:00:22 Katina Faye waves to Erik Goodwin.

02:00:26 Melinda Michaels sighs.

02:00:30 You wave to Katina Faye.

02:00:32 [MTTS] atherj: Oh my gosh I just saw the asteroid mining changes. That's totally awesome.

02:00:33 Melinda says to Nissi, "Where we doing this thing?"

02:00:34 Katina Faye waves to you.

02:00:38 Erik Goodwin says into his blue metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Maybe, say that instead, next time?"

02:00:49 [MTTS] kaite: It sure is!

02:00:56 [MTTS] muhala: Aren't they?

02:01:00 Melinda Michaels glances down at her tyrian purple wrist-mounted chronometer momentarily.

02:01:03 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person medium transport "Procrastination" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

02:01:04 [MTTS] something: Coolest thing.

02:01:10 Cheri Lindbergh sighs. "Fucking private meetings, why oh why."

02:01:14 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, I can't wait to try it out. I'm used to building bigger buildings anyways so it should be cool to have options.

02:01:16 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes a recent find in deep space.

02:01:18 Melinda Michaels nods to Cheri Lindbergh. "It happens."

02:01:19 Erik says to Cheri, "The buty of spy drones."

02:01:21 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

02:01:24 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I like griping."

02:01:24 Melinda Michaels stands up from a cushy booth seat.

02:01:34 Katina smiles after Melinda.

02:01:35 Erik Goodwin says, "Oh I said that out loud."

02:01:37 Erik Goodwin says, "Whoops."

02:01:38 Cheri wails, "WHYYYYY!"

02:01:39 [MTTS] atherj: Now all we need is for the mining to be dependent on asteroids that are brought in! So we can try to encourage non-temporary asteroid processor hauling.

02:01:40 Melinda taps Cheri on the nose. "I know," she grins.

02:02:06 [MTTS] atherj: And yeah, I'm generally use to building bigger buildings too.

02:02:21 [MTTS] Ulias: Yeah that would be sweet, especially with this new thing. You could like, go haul in a radioactive one and then mine it.

02:02:26 [MTTS] kaite: I sure appreciate the variety.

02:03:16 A group of pilots is holding an intense meeting on the other side of the room.

02:03:18 Cheri says to Melinda, "Good luck."

02:03:22 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Give peace a chance."

02:03:36 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Uhhh, trying to think of more old sayings."

02:03:47 Katina says to Melinda, "You don't need me right?"

02:03:51 Melinda Michaels grins at Cheri Lindbergh. "I actually like that one."

02:04:00 Melinda says to Katina, "Na."

02:04:05 Katina smiles softly and nods.

02:04:10 Erik Goodwin says, "That sounds like it could be a pretty sweet song."

02:04:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Then there is make love not war."

02:04:13 Nissi Valdaire says, "There's Lily and Shule. We're supposed to discuss the station thing."

02:04:15 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Love makes the galaxy turn."

02:04:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:04:28 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Wait, love makes the galaxy go 'round."

02:04:32 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

02:04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "It should!"

02:04:41 You grin.

02:04:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "Oh, they are in this room with me."

02:04:55 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's convenient."

02:04:57 Erik Goodwin laughs at Nissi Valdaire.

02:04:57 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Yeah, make love not war!"

02:04:58 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes it is."

02:04:59 You grin.

02:05:04 Erik Goodwin grins.

02:05:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "I'm awake, I swear."

02:05:12 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Where are we doing this?"

02:05:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:05:14 Melinda Michaels grins at Nissi Valdaire.

02:05:14 Damien Goss says, "I always preferred Don't waste bullets, unless you buy in bulk."

02:05:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm not sure I am."

02:05:21 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Damien Goss.

02:05:24 Melinda says to Nissi, "We doing this here or elsewhere?"

02:05:25 Erik says to Damien, "Where did you come from."

02:05:28 Katina Faye laughs at Erik Goodwin.

02:05:39 Damien says to Erik, "I've been sitting here the whole time."

02:05:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well we have a conference room somewhere."

02:05:49 "Over there?" You point vaguely off into space.

02:05:49 Nissi Valdaire stands up from a cushy booth seat.

02:05:52 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:05:55 Erik Goodwin says, "I didn't see you there."

02:06:04 Nissi Valdaire takes Melinda Michaels into her group.

02:06:05 Nissi Valdaire takes Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident into her group.

02:06:07 Nissi Valdaire takes you into her group.

02:06:15 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "No punching!"

02:06:19 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Or killing."

02:06:22 You grin.

02:06:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

02:06:29 Nissi Valdaire nods.

02:06:33 You say, "I don't plan to do either."

You can go out.

02:06:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "I found it."

02:06:57 Melinda Michaels sits down on a faux wood padded chair.

02:06:58 You smile.

02:07:01 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a faux wood padded chair.

02:07:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a faux wood padded chair.

02:07:05 You sit down on a faux wood padded chair.

02:07:53 Nissi Valdaire says, "So where to start..."

02:08:01 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:08:07 Nissi Valdaire says, "Lily, your last letter was pretty focused on the protest incident."

02:08:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:08:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "Which wasn't good, and that's what caused Ather to ask us not to include SEAS. But that was just one reason."

02:08:40 Shule sits on the edge of his chair and leaning forward, listens intently.

02:09:04 Nissi Valdaire says, "Before that I'd gotten several complaints about how it wasn't easy for others to work with you or have their ideas considered."

02:09:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "And now, well, there's this thing with Shule threatening my alliance with open hostilities, that's kind of a big one."

02:09:31 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:09:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks.

02:09:50 Melinda Michaels says, "Um."

02:10:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Wait how did Shule threaten with open hostilities?"

02:10:12 Nissi Valdaire says, "About the complaints we got, Melinda probably has a better handle on the details than I do."

02:10:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was there and he certainly did not."

02:10:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh yes he did."

02:10:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well he did in the letter he sent me."

02:10:58 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Beacons anyone?"

02:11:07 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I shall do this."

02:11:24 [Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sure."

02:11:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "Afterwards I learned Constantine didn't know anything of it and it sounds like nobody else did either, so I'm not worried it'll come to anything. But being officially threatened like that kinda sets some things in motion."

02:11:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at you thoughtfully.

02:11:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "I had to notify our government, allies, all that stuff."

02:11:44 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "May I have 2 more for beacons?"

02:12:03 Melinda Michaels turns off a tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator.

02:13:03 Lily says to you, "I certainly didn't interpret that letter which you sent me a copy of as threatening anything. But you did point out that Morris's behavior was not in keeping with what one would expect amongst us who are from different alliances particularly when we do have a NAP."

02:13:36 Melinda Michaels says, "There was a flat out threat in that letter."

02:13:45 Melinda Michaels says, "There is no way of ignoring it."

02:13:48 You say, "Well, perhaps neither of us interpreted it as a threat, but it seems they did."

02:13:50 Lily says to you, "Did you intend that to be a threat?"

02:14:00 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well as I explained in my reply, friendly fire incidents are almost always the fault of the victim, if you consider them the fault of anybody."

02:14:13 Nissi Valdaire says, "To pretend it was an intentional act is very disingenuous."

02:14:17 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Earth lounge please."

02:14:27 Nissi Valdaire says, "The ship that accidentally hits a friendly usually couldn't have done anything to avoid it."

02:14:36 You say, "I understand that. It wasn't the act of the friendly fire that I was concerned about, but the response afterwords."

02:14:41 Nissi Valdaire says, "So to say that open hostilities will exist if another incident like that takes place... yeah, that's a threat."

02:15:08 Melinda Michaels asks, "You're gonna threaten like that because somebody shoots off at the mouth?"

02:15:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:15:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is true and all that I ever said was 'please watch your fire. I said nothing hostile but Morris got on his high-horse and responded very rudely. If it were someone from a ship I was flying, I would say we're sorry and i'll ask my crew to be more careful."

02:16:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Just common courtessy you kow?"

02:16:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Lnow?"

02:16:34 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.

02:17:02 Melinda Michaels says, "Morris did run his mouth and it wasn't necessary. But to threaten ending our pact because somebody is being stupid, is quite a bit overboard."

02:17:04 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well I mean, 'watch your fire' is a useless statement. Anybody experienced at flying in invasions gets annoyed at that because friendly fire is almost always the victim's fault."

02:17:11 Nissi Valdaire says, "It doesn't matter how careful the crew is."

02:17:21 Nissi Valdaire says, "If anybody shoulda been more careful, it was the pilot of your ship."

02:17:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "But realistically you can't track the position of every enemy so it's really useless to blame anybody."

02:18:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it was Shule's ship nit mine but anyway. 'it's not about blaming here though but how Morris behaved as h though he didn't care."

02:18:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, OOCly, "Have an issue here give me a couple moments please."

02:18:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "Fine, Morris can be a jerk. I'm not sure threatening open hostilities if Morris is a jerk again is really a good position to take either."

02:18:32 You say, "I understand and my apologies for being a bit overboard. I have heard many times though, of people asking other ships to watch their fire. Yeah, it's a pretty useless statment as we do try really hard to watch where we are tracking."

02:18:34 Nissi Valdaire says, "Either way it was a threat and we had to react to it."

02:18:43 Melinda Michaels says, "You can't put all this on Morris. Yes he was in the wrong but so was Shule. This is part of the problem. You don't seem to shoulder any blame when it is shared."

02:18:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in a faux wood padded chair and goes to sleep.

02:19:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "I'm not sure you're getting it. People do watch their fire. Friendly fire almost always happens when an enemy moves and a friendly moves into their coordinates. The shooting ship is tracking the correct target but the victim got in the way."

02:19:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "People who insist that everybody 'watch their fire' don't understand what's happening."

02:20:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "And yeah, that's what all this always comes down to. You guys point the finger everywhere but at yourselves. You can't clear the air about a situation when some of the people in it won't accept any responsibility."

02:20:55 "I do understand it." You nod. "I know I've hit my own navy on occasion accientally."

02:21:01 Nissi Valdaire nods.

02:21:28 You say, "I'd be willing to write you a letter to pass on to the government apologizing for my over reaction."

02:21:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

02:21:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:21:59 Lily says to you, "Did you really intend this to be a threat though?"

02:22:18 Melinda Michaels says, "Saying we'll get the pact ended or view something as an act of war is a threat."

02:22:35 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Last call, one more for a beacon?"

02:22:41 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes."

02:22:52 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Earth lounge."

02:22:59 You say to Lily, "No, I already said that I never intended it as a threat, but they obviously reacted to it as though they felt threatened. Therefore, I should at least write a letter apologizing for the threat."

02:23:17 Melinda says to you, "Explain how you meant it?"

02:23:31 Nissi Valdaire removes a small black leather portfolio from a small chaingun-shaped black vinyl shoulder-slung bag for a moment.

02:23:32 Nissi Valdaire removes a sheet of yellow paper from a small black leather portfolio.
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "New or Old Earth?"

02:23:48 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "The sexy one."

02:24:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "'However, he should be warned that if this type of incident happens again and he responds in a like manner, we may not consider it accidental and more than likely consider it a violation of the NAP between the AEU and the League.'"

02:24:10 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm at manhattan spaceport presently."

02:24:16 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Right on."

02:24:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's what's written."

02:24:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well our reaction was though that Morris wanted to be hostile especiall yby his tone so he really didn't give us much choice but to interpret his intentions as hostile though. Still I don't think that Shule wanted to threaten anyone except to express that we've agreed to get along under the current agreement and I didn't have the impresion that Morris intended to."

02:24:50 Melinda Michaels asks, "So anytime somebody gets stupid and runs their mouth, are we to worry about you guys wanting to cut off the agreement?"

02:25:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "No but common courtessy certainly goes a long way don't you think?"

02:25:15 Nissi Valdaire removes a small black leather portfolio from a small chaingun-shaped black vinyl shoulder-slung bag for a moment.

02:25:15 Nissi Valdaire puts a sheet of yellow paper in a small black leather portfolio.

02:25:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "Common courtesy goes both ways."

02:25:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Certainly accidental htings occur and and we agree on that point."

02:25:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "This event didn't happen in a vacuum. I mean... it literally did, but you know what I mean."

02:25:54 You nod to Nissi Valdaire.

02:26:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Wanting to end our agreement because somebody is rude is flat out stupid. I am sorry but it is. Did you guys really believe Morris was going to start a damn war because he was being mouthy? People are mouthy all the time."

02:26:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I don't want to deviate from this but I sure would like to hear how I've not been willing to listen or receive ideas. I've often felt I was on my own without any input form others except when they thought they were left out."

02:28:06 Melinda Michaels says, "Refusing to bend and change where your parts come from. Apparently refusing to change things up in 777. That one is second hand."

02:28:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wait."

02:29:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd like to know the more about that. I have always tried to accomodate LIBS and put parts where they wanted also, it was Johann who specified who setup the stations and I agreed with him."

02:29:42 Melinda Michaels says, "When Morris started up his org, you had to argue with me because you were refusing to use his core over rift surfers. This is probably because you and Morris don't get along. But, we had to argue over it for a few letters before you finally agreed to work with it."

02:30:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As for where parts come from? Nobody ever volunteered anything. In fact, I had to write out everything for evenia and she would forget things often. I certainly would have appreciated other ideas."

02:32:29 Melinda Michaels says, "I dunno, she doesn't seem to have issues when she builds for me."

02:32:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So this is really news to me. I even asked them repeatedly if certain parts were ok for them. She wanted to use the top charger though perhaps that's why she was upset."
Melinda Michaels says, "And while we are on this, I am going to clear something up."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So we gave into her."

02:32:50 Melinda Michaels says, "I do not just lower the gavel and make these station decisions on my own. Votes are taken. And as far as new org participation goes, you did have a problem using parts from Morris at first. Till I pointed out how I let SEAS in when nobody wanted me to do it."

02:33:05 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:35:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Huh wait I didn't really care so I think you have it the other way around. I was just scrambling to accomodate both Morris and Joel. I did want to get along and you are the one Melinda who told me you didn't want morris on the Asteroid processor."

02:35:19 Melinda Michaels says, "I did not."

02:35:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'I still have the letter melinda."

02:35:38 Melinda Michaels says, "I told you that if you could not find a part from Morris, you could use a part from somebody else."

02:35:57 Melinda Michaels says, "And if he was going to be nasty about it and fight with you, then do as you wish."

02:35:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a small black leather portfolio from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:36:28 Melinda Michaels says, "So yes, I said if you guys couldn't sort it out."

02:36:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a small black leather portfolio.

02:36:53 Melinda Michaels asks, "Was this when you two were fighting?"

02:36:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a letter in a small black leather portfolio.

02:36:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a small black leather portfolio.

02:37:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a letter in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

02:37:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a small black leather portfolio.

02:37:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a letter in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

02:37:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a small black leather portfolio.

02:37:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a letter in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

02:38:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Melinda you specifically asked me not to include Morris because he wasn't qualified yet. So I only set out to honor your request but Morris pressured and I honestly didn't mind whose core and it has nothing to do with whether or not I like Morris or not."

02:38:39 Melinda Michaels says, "Oh no no, yes then I did."

02:38:47 Melinda Michaels says, "But once he qualified."

02:38:54 Melinda Michaels says, "You did not want to use his core."

02:39:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Huh that's not so."

02:39:04 Melinda Michaels says, "Because you wanted to use Surfers."

02:39:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes because that was all I oculd get from them at the time."

02:39:23 Melinda Michaels says, "That's what you told me."

02:39:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And it had nothing to do with him and no I didn't realize morris was actually qualified by then."

02:39:53 Melinda Michaels says, "I tried to explain to you that we need to make room for new orgs, especially those who wish to vassalize."

02:40:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course and I totally agree."

02:40:11 Melinda Michaels says, "So let surfers and journey take turns."

02:40:25 Nissi Valdaire says, "Let me ask you this..."

02:40:32 Melinda Michaels says, "But you argued the point before we finally got it settled."

02:40:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok well I never got that about let them take turns but I seill would have gone out of my way to accomodate both."

02:40:39 Nissi says to Lily, "Is there anything you feel you did wrong in this discussion about Morris and his org you had with Melinda?"

02:41:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Mis-understood what Melinda wanted."

02:41:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I honestly didn't care one way or the other who the orgs were and I was trying to accomodate everyone."

02:42:13 Melinda Michaels says, "You specifically told me you would use surfers cores. It was during the time you and Morris were going on about something."

02:42:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And regardless of Morris's attitude, I still wouldn't care. It's a business arrangement."

02:42:53 Melinda Michaels says, "Then, after some time, you finally agreed. I dunno whether it was because you didn't read the letters correctly or what."

02:43:05 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.

02:43:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I supose that's it but it was mostly that I thought you didn't want me to put morris on at all and I never got it that he was finally qualified or their taking turns which would have been fine."

02:44:04 Melinda Michaels says, "I specificly remember pointing out to you that, even when you and I argued, I did not kick you out of the stations. Then you went with the decision."

02:44:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or if I had parts from both that would fit, I'd accomodate them. So that is what I did."

02:44:42 Melinda Michaels asks, "Okay, what other problems have you got?"

02:45:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "None really except we'd still appreciate the opportunity to work with you all."

02:45:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Because this is going to be a she said she said thing and you've got to read letters twice if you need to do so. It'll help negate confusion and arguing."

02:45:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure thing and I shall do that."

02:45:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

02:45:59 Melinda Michaels says, "Well, I have some issues."

02:46:35 Melinda Michaels says, "Why are you not willing to just say you're sorry for things and move on instead of sitting and blaming everything on everybody else."

02:47:32 Melinda Michaels says, "Because I am gonna be frank here. Everybody is tired of having fingers pointed at them at every turn and people just don't want to work with somebody who isn't willing to compromise and shoulder some of the blame for things that go wrong."

02:48:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well i'm not blaming others as you see it though."

02:48:08 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah that's kinda the essence of it. Every incident we talk about mostly results from a grudge held from some other incident before that."

02:48:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes, you kinda are."

02:48:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was just ointing out facts not point blame."

02:48:21 Nissi Valdaire says, "I've got a theory about it."

02:48:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pointing blame."

02:48:28 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:48:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "I think you believe others can't tell when you're acting in bad faith."

02:49:00 Nissi Valdaire says, "But we can. So this stuff about misreading this and not hearing that, it just pisses people off, because it never rings true."

02:49:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I believe others make a lot of assumptions too which are unfounded."

02:49:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Without first asking any quesitons."

02:49:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Yes, you believe I make assumptions for one."

02:49:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "And you're doing it again. You're saying none of it is ever your fault."

02:49:31 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:49:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No i'm not."

02:49:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It was my fault for not showing up at the protest."

02:50:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It wasn't that I didn't want ot be there though and this is how you all want to interpret it."

02:50:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Then why didn't you just say sorry that happened and be done. Rather than saying, Johann this, Eli that."

02:50:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because I did feel torn between how Johann has treated me in the past when I didn't get something done."

02:50:49 Melinda Michaels says, "Can you prove how he has treated you? He says he hasn't."

02:50:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We've discussed it and I think he knows where I was coming from now."

02:51:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hi."

02:51:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Have either of you felt that you wanted to please more than one aprty and couldn't?"

02:51:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "One party that is?"

02:51:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Greetings Tara."

02:51:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Of course."

02:52:03 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure, but I try to own up to the fact that I made my own decision about it."

02:52:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So this is how it was for me and I hoped it wouldn't take that long and I could try, with the little time I had to show up there."

02:52:20 Melinda Michaels says, "But making excuses and pointing fingers is only going to serve the alienation purpose. People just don't like it. I am sorry would have worked much better."

02:52:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How are you?"

02:53:35 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:53:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Good, just about to do some roid hualing."

02:53:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well for me it wasn't finger-pointing. Just expressing that there were circumstances which either involved communications or how I perceived that Johann would treat me if I didn't put up that lousy beacon."

02:53:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right on I'm mining at the moment."

02:54:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So you haul 'em and I'll mine 'em."

02:54:14 Melinda Michaels says, "Johann is not involved in station building."

02:54:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He is in 777 yes."

02:54:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We took that project on together."

02:54:37 Melinda Michaels says, "No, he isn't. His org, yes."

02:55:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's Johann who has generally been the spokesperson."

02:55:02 Melinda Michaels says, "It's kinda like Cats, Nissi doesn't order me around on how to build stations."

02:55:31 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Here's the reason people don't really buy that. If you thought people were gonna be pissed about the beacon and you weren't sure what to do... well first of all, everybody was at the protest already pretty much, so clearly nobody was that worried about the beacon. But why wouldn't you just ask if anybody minded a delay?"

02:55:50 Melinda Michaels nods. "Even Johann was there."

02:56:02 Nissi Valdaire says, "It always comes down to the fact that Lily did whatever Lily felt like doing. There's always a reason for it, or something that makes it somebody else's fault. But it's always that."

02:56:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When we got back one time the Asteroid processor was down and he was the one tho leaned on me about it and I felt embarrassed that it had gone down and apologized."

02:56:59 Melinda Michaels says, "Then why didn't you come to me if he was making things that rough for you? We weren't involved in 777 but I may could have assisted in stopping the issues."

02:57:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I am sorry for everything."

02:57:54 Melinda Michaels says, "Stations go down all the time. It happens. If anybody gives you grief, tell me. I am used to yelling at people by now."

02:58:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok but I know you take on enough so I just took it on but I do want to please folks and I know they depend on the stations and other things."

02:59:00 Melinda Michaels says, "You can't please everybody all of the time."

02:59:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "First Roid is a metal rich. Nice."

02:59:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs. "Isn't that the truth."

02:59:36 Melinda Michaels asks, "So, what's next then?"

03:00:02 Nissi Valdaire asks, "The thing with Evenia and 777? Did we discuss that at all?"

03:00:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Right, she said she had a couple of ideas like for a message beacon to warn pilots and you told her no."

03:00:46 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "A message beacon in Mir."

03:00:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have no idea. It's pretty much up to you all to decide whether or not you will work with us. As I say setting aside how I regard Morris has nothing to do with how I would treat him regarding his involvement on any station I would build."

03:01:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know you have Evenia working with you and I would add her back to our warehouse."

03:02:10 You ask, "What was her idea about 777 and a message beacon?"

03:02:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I'd like to know."

03:02:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

03:02:53 Melinda Michaels asks, "Did you tell her she couldn't put a message beacon in Mir and that you wouldn't move the 776 beacon Battle of Mir in order to replace 071 and illiminate the need for the extra station?"

03:03:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Huh no."

03:03:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is total news to me."

03:03:19 Melinda Michaels says, "I see."

03:03:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "We could bring her in here and see if she wants to repeat that story."

03:03:35 Melinda Michaels says, "Eve or Nicolette, somebody, said it ain't happening. Your name got thrown in it."

03:03:44 Melinda Michaels turns on a tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator.

03:03:47 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

03:03:52 Melinda Michaels removes a silver flat einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

03:03:53 Melinda Michaels punches a number into a silver flat einrophone.

03:04:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We don't have anything in battle of mir nor have we ever but we've certainly made changes all along."

03:04:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We actually started out in b-24."

03:04:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Where we could use a Solar module but it's obviously farther."

03:04:46 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

03:04:46 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey, we are discussing station stuff with Lily. She says she had no disagreements at 777 with you. We are requesting for you to come to our org conference room."

03:04:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I have never heard this other idea."

03:05:03 Lily says to you, "Did she tell you?"

03:05:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And if so I'd have appreciated knowing about it."

03:05:23 You shake your head at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "This is the first I've heard of it, honesty."

03:05:28 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

03:05:28 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay, yell when you get here."

03:05:36 Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:

03:05:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Thanks."

03:05:41 Melinda Michaels places a silver flat einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

03:05:48 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll solve this."

03:05:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd sure like to."

03:06:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "More like love to."

03:06:39 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:07:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The placement of 776 was jsut the same configuration we generally use outside of an FTL sector I have never heard anything else from anyone."

03:07:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "As for a beacon to warn others why would I be against such a thing?"

03:08:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks.

03:08:14 Nissi Valdaire says, "That's what we said."

03:08:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I say this is the absolute first I've ever heard of this."

03:08:57 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:08:58 You say, "I don't see why a message beacon in Mir would be an issue, but then again, what do I know about temp stations."

03:09:03 Nissi Valdaire stands up from a faux wood padded chair.

03:09:04 Nissi Valdaire disbands her group.

03:09:06 Nissi Valdaire walks out.

03:09:15 Nissi Valdaire just arrived, followed by her group.

03:09:16 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.
Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Evenia Callseah.

03:09:17 Evenia Callseah grins. "Heya."

03:09:19 Nissi Valdaire disbands her group.

03:09:23 Nissi Valdaire sits down on a faux wood padded chair.

03:09:24 You wave to Evenia Callseah.

03:09:24 Melinda says to Evenia, "Hey."

03:09:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Evenia Callseah.

03:09:31 Evenia Callseah waves to you.

03:09:31 Nissi Valdaire says, "We're trying to get to the bottom of all these station issues."

03:09:44 Evenia Callseah sighs. "Well this could take a while."

03:09:47 Evenia Callseah sits down on a faux wood padded chair.

03:09:47 Nissi Valdaire grins.

03:10:16 Evenia Callseah says, "I mentioned to Johann I was coming over. So if there's shit I don't remember. He said he'd come along. I get busy. So forget things."

03:10:36 Melinda says to Evenia, "He's welcome to."

03:10:49 Melinda says to Evenia, "We are told there were no issues with a message beacon at Mir or any other station in 777 between you and Lily. Would you mind to clarify?"

03:11:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah please do as this is the first I ever heard of this Evenia."

03:12:18 "Of course I would." Evenia Callseah nods. "We had many a conversation about stations over the course of the time libs started activly helping with 777. At one point I mentioned the message beacon, as I mentioned to you guys. But in all of Lily's letters, she never said yes to it. I have most of them still maybe, but there was always plenty of confusion, because sometimes Lily would send 3 or 4 letters relating to the one thing, and confuse everyone."

03:12:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't recall anything about a message beacon in mir."

03:12:56 Evenia Callseah shrugs. "Well I did ask you."

03:13:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or in 776 I mean."

03:13:13 Melinda Michaels says, "I think she said it was in Mir."

03:13:21 Evenia Callseah says, "In mir, yes."

03:13:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well either case why would I oppose something like that?"

03:13:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

03:13:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "A message beacon is a message beacon."

03:13:54 Melinda Michaels says, "Sorry if I don't find any of this funny."

03:14:04 Evenia Callseah says, "Well how am I to know? Sometimes you made many strange decisions relating to that area, and confused the living hell out of me."

03:14:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't either but I certainly didn't oppose a message beacon anywhere."

03:14:45 Nissi Valdaire asks, "So Lily just never acknowledged the idea at all?"

03:15:17 "I remember bringing it up at least once." Evenia Callseah shakes her head at Nissi Valdaire. "At least. I mean I don't have a photographic memory or anything so I can't tell you when. But I did."

03:15:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So Evenia if you're saying I didn't respond then how is it you are to arbitrarily assume that I am opposing something? I obviously never got that information to even have the opportunity to decide on one way or the other."

03:15:38 Melinda says to Evenia, "Did you ever get flat out told no by her on station decisions?"

03:15:44 Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:15:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "On which one."

03:16:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

03:16:47 Melinda Michaels says, "I know Johann said he had to take care of letters because the two of you would have issues and he'd handle it."

03:17:15 Evenia Callseah says, "One that I remember very clearly was when we wanted a bit of order out there. You wanted things to remain as...whoever is around, builds whatever, which does not work for me. But then in those letters, you also mentioned that you somehow thought we wanted you to buy accelloraters, and that you couldn't. that was 4 letters of mess. but you said you didn't want to assign orgs stations, and just wanted anyone to build whatever."

03:17:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No that's not exactly it evenia."

03:17:58 Evenia says to Melinda, "That's true as well. Johann took care of a bunch of those, because I didn't need the constant letters back and fourth."

03:18:39 Evenia Callseah says, "And this issue right here. Is one that Johann took care of. Because I tossed my hands in the air and told him to deal with it."

03:19:00 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Should Johann be in here then?"

03:19:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What I said was it was a good idea to portion off the stations so that we had defined responsibilities but I still wanted the assurance that if one org wasn't available to put up a station, that it wouldn't go without attention."

03:19:23 Evenia Callseah says, "Maybe, because he seems to keep that mess straighter than I do."

03:19:55 Nissi Valdaire nods. "If he knows the details on it and wants to try to untangle all this."

03:19:56 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm not going to battle basic words with you. But I don't have those letters. So I can't show you what you said."

03:20:04 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Johann."

03:20:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So'well I know what I said and i've probably got most letters that I've sent."

03:20:40 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:20:51 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "We are in the org conference room. Do you mind to come in?"

03:21:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sitll though I was fine with the division of the responsibilities I jsut wanted assurance that if someone wasn't available we would back one anothe rup so I honestly thought that was where it stood."

03:21:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I only mad parts available for that purpose so noone would have to hunt down the other party if they needed to build a station."

03:21:56 Melinda Michaels says, "Well as it stands currently, stations will be listed in the book. I am gonna wield the hammer of power and say that you will have to go by the set up."

03:21:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Made that is."

03:22:45 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

03:22:45 Melinda Michaels strolls out.

03:22:53 Melinda Michaels just arrived, followed by her group.

Raiatea the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Johann Schraft.

03:23:03 Melinda Michaels sits down on a faux wood padded chair.

03:23:05 Johann Schraft sits down on a faux wood padded chair.

03:23:24 You wave to Johann Schraft.

03:23:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."

03:23:38 Johann Schraft says, "Hello everyone."

03:23:42 Lily says to Johann, "If I might ask didn't we come to an agreement concerning dividing up the stations between both orgs?"

03:24:05 Melinda Michaels says to Johann, "There is some disagreement about Eve wanting more organized station setups in 777 and Lily not. Do you know anything about it?"

03:24:22 Johann Schraft says, "There was some confusion at first yes."

03:24:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So is that horrible?"

03:24:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I certainly didn't refuse anything and I was very happy with the outcome."

03:24:55 Evenia Callseah says, "When that confusion is in 4 letters and says 4 different things in the space of 2 hours, yes."

03:25:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well that happens because sometimes things need to be sorted out."

03:25:32 Johann Schraft says, "Umm, we did end up working things out. Each org was the primary caretaker of four stations."

03:25:41 Evenia Callseah says, "Normally I'd do that without 4 different letters saying different things before someone could even respond to the firt."

03:25:44 Evenia Callseah coughs. "First."

03:26:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.

03:26:42 Johann Schraft says, "Everything was going well until the protest."

03:27:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sorry evenia but it's been what a couple of months ago so I don't sit on things like that. I really find it more productive that we came to an agreement."

03:27:36 Melinda Michaels says, "I think Eve's problem here is that it should not take mounds of letters to make an agreement over stations."

03:27:55 Evenia Callseah says, "And it shouldn't end up stressing a person to the point where they could give a fuck less."

03:27:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well then respond to the first one or suggest we get together and discuss it."

03:28:09 Evenia Callseah says, "That's a little hard when the 3 letters all come at once."

03:28:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I certainly have felt that way too you know but I sometimes have limited time to work so I have to use the mail but I'm always willing to discuss things."

03:29:29 Evenia Callseah says, "I haven't been more relaxed since I got things in order out there. And I haven't enjoyed building stations more. There was so much stress related to all that. But now there's none. Zero. I know what needs doing and when. And there is zero drama."

03:29:55 Melinda Michaels says, "From where I sit, this is the problem."

03:29:59 Johann says to Lily, "I know you like to communicate via the mail. It's not a bad thing, but when there's maybe any confusion, I know a face-to-face, or even a phone call can help clear things up more speedily, and yes, with less stress all around."

03:31:05 Melinda Michaels says, "A, blaming others for everything. B, not fully paying attention and making decisions more stressful than they need to be. And C, getting your backs up and making threats of war over a mouthy pilot."

03:31:20 Melinda Michaels asks, "Am I incorrect here?"

03:31:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nobody has made any threats of war at all here."

03:31:28 Evenia says to Melinda, "That pretty much says it in one."

03:31:48 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah that kinda sums it up."

03:31:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well Johann, you have always called me when you had questions and I responded right?"

03:32:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I ahve also called you."

03:32:10 Evenia says to Lily, "And how many times did I ask you respectfully for your number so I could do that?"

03:32:10 Melinda Michaels says, "But Lily, you portrayed him as being nasty with you."

03:32:18 Nissi Valdaire says, "Everything just goes straight to being personal and things start being motivated by grudges."

03:32:29 Johann says to Lily, "Sometimes you are hard to get a hold of, but yes, if I call, or write you and ask you to call me, you will."

03:32:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Evenia I have never had any other means to communicate with you though and if I'm not seeing you on the comm,i only have one other means to communicate."

03:32:50 Melinda Michaels says, "I hate to do things this way."

03:32:51 Johann Schraft nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:33:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes because I don't work fulltime anymore."

03:33:28 Melinda Michaels says, "But if we are to sort things, there are more pissed off pilots than those in this room."

03:33:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am not able to help that and i'm sorry for that."

03:33:41 Melinda Michaels says, "So I am gonna make two suggestions."

03:33:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is anyone busy that would like to take a quick, and I mean quick, trip across the skim?"

03:34:36 Melinda Michaels says, "First, Lily is probably going to have to publically apologize on the boards because she did do the blame game publically."

03:35:08 Melinda Michaels says, "I don't know how it will be received."

03:35:11 A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:35:21 Melinda Michaels asks, "Are there any disagreements there?"

03:35:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.

03:35:43 "I think that's a good idea." Evenia Callseah shakes her head. "Even if it isn't received well by everyone, that's a hell of a start."

03:36:10 Johann Schraft says, "I have no issues."

03:36:18 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

03:36:40 Nissi Valdaire asks, "My only question is what resolution are we trying to get?"

03:36:52 Nissi Valdaire says, "I think there's two things to decide."

03:37:16 Nissi Valdaire says, "Whether SEAS parts get included on the main stations everybody elses and whether SEAS people are in charge of building any of those stations."

03:37:28 Melinda Michaels nods.

03:37:32 Evenia Callseah nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:37:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "Everybody uses that is."

03:38:31 Melinda says to Lily, "While I understand we all get upset and spout off by times, can I get your word that you will work hard to just learn to apologize and not drag everybody in it while doing so?"

03:38:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'i'll say that for 777 that we're more than happy to resume maintaining the 4 stations we agreed on and we're also open for changes to their configuration."

03:38:51 Johann Schraft says, "I still feel as though Evenia needs an personal apology though for all the hurtful things she sent. I don't care if it's public or not, if it is good enough for Evenia, it's good enough for me."

03:39:11 Melinda Michaels says, "Eve is in charge of 777 now. You will take that up with her once everybody figures out if they want to try this again."

03:39:38 Evenia Callseah says, "All I need to hear is a basic apology. I don't need any kind of public display."

03:39:51 Lily says to Evenia, "I am sorry for what I said."

03:40:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do have some trust issues though and hopefully time will change those."

03:40:48 Evenia says to Lily, "In that case. When things are resolved. If things go in the right direction. Consider seas back on stations that I maintain."

03:40:57 Johann Schraft nods.

03:41:01 Nissi Valdaire nods.

03:41:05 Melinda Michaels says, "Second, for a probationary period, no changes are to be made to the station setup that will be published in the new booklet without discussing them with me. All this arguing is utter nonsense and should never happen. So, I'll try to help where I can to keep it from happening again."

03:41:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:41:35 Lily says to Melinda, "Do you want us to resume with the Asteroid Processor?"

03:41:36 Melinda Michaels says, "I hate being like that."

03:41:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's fine."

03:41:44 "That works." Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "Any random issues that come up, I'll let you know personally."

03:42:19 Melinda Michaels says, "Nobody is resuming anything till we see what people think after this apology. I did not force everybody not to work with SEAS and won't force them to do so."

03:42:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

03:42:32 Evenia Callseah nods.

03:42:39 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just so I'm clear I'm not suggesting taking anything away that Eve has just taken on. I don't think that would be right. Unless it's Eve's decision to turn anything over for her own reasons."

03:42:57 Evenia says to Lily, "But whatever way it goes. I appreciate your apology. And I think we both have trust issues. But we have plenty of time."

03:43:03 Melinda Michaels says, "No, even if Lily helps build stations. Eve is in charge of what happens out there."

03:43:08 Nissi Valdaire nods.

03:44:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Constantine enjoys building and he would be more than happy to help with ours or anytime you need him to. He has a lot on his plate right now so he might not be as available but he wants to contribute when he can."

03:44:10 Evenia Callseah nods to Nissi Valdaire. "Thank you both." Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "Depending on how this apology and whatnot goes, we can figure out details then."

03:44:32 Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. Constantine is actually a good and reliable builder."

03:44:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, we need a station coordinator office."

03:44:36 Melinda Michaels laughs.

03:44:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:44:42 Nissi Valdaire grins.

03:44:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I actually think that's a good idea."

03:44:47 Nissi Valdaire says, "Pretty much."

03:44:59 Johann Schraft glances at Evenia Callseah and glances at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:45:11 A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:45:16 Melinda says to Lily, "So my last question, are you truly sorry for your part in all this mess?"

03:45:18 "Only if the deputy is allowed in there too." Evenia Callseah grins at Melinda Michaels. "I want the spoils damn it."

03:45:20 Lily says to Evenia, "I will add you back to our warehouse with standard access."

03:45:29 Johann Schraft says, "And I never mind being a mediator if things get tense. I can work with anyone."

03:45:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have one more thing to bring up."

03:45:58 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."

03:46:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am not certain where Starseekers is on anything."

03:46:17 Melinda Michaels shrugs. "Neither are we."

03:46:22 Evenia says to Lily, "Thank you. And I will personally fix your access to ours. But just so there's no confusing. My actions will depend on how this apology is received."

03:46:25 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Is Starseekers even active at this point?"

03:46:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do have access to their warehouse."

03:46:34 Melinda Michaels says, "I saw Eva the other day."

03:46:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's hard to say."

03:46:49 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hm."

03:46:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I see Angel and Evangelin occassionally."

03:46:53 Melinda Michaels says, "I am going to write Kim a letter and see what her plans are."

03:46:56 Nissi Valdaire nods.

03:46:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:47:08 Evenia Callseah says, "I was wondering that same thing too actually."

03:47:15 Johann Schraft says, "Still, once their parts are gone, they're gone."

03:47:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I put all of the shared parts between sEAS and Starseekers back into Starseekers warehouse."

03:47:21 Evenia says to Melinda, "So for the time being, carry on using the batteries I've been using?"

03:47:29 Melinda says to Evenia, "Yup."

03:47:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "If an org goes inactive I don't see an issue with booting them off. If they get things going again then they can be back on with our apologies. But there's no need to haul dead weight with as many orgs as we need to accommodate."

03:47:45 Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "I figured, just wanted to double check."

03:47:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just my opinion."

03:48:02 You nod.

03:48:14 Melinda says to Lily, "A word of advice when you do that apology, don't drag others names into it. Just be real and go with how you feel about your part in the mess."

03:48:36 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire. "I agree."

03:48:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well there are a bunch of power plants that SEAS and starseekers purchased together, it would be good to use those but if you don't htink it's the right thing to do, I unserstand and would probably be best if Kim gave her ok to that."

03:48:45 "I agree with you." Evenia Callseah nods to Nissi Valdaire. "It's not like they can't be put back on eventually."

03:48:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:49:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So if we're added back, then what would we contribute? We were buying power plants."

03:49:46 Nissi Valdaire says, "I'm not against using parts that are already paid for and waiting. Just maybe that should be the end of it until one of them is around to properly deal with things."

03:49:53 Melinda Michaels says, "If all works out, we'll use the batteries in Starseekers warehouse then will stop if they don't show to be working towards helping out. There is no need for SEAS to lose megacredits because they don't know what they are doing."

03:49:59 Evenia Callseah says, "Well when I wrote out the station setup for 777 for example, I had seas down with seekers on batteries."

03:50:13 Melinda Michaels nods.

03:50:28 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll leave that as is till the batteries or the org is gone."

03:50:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok that works and I honestly don't think Kim would mind since she only didn't want us to participate on income-producing stations while AEU was on strike but I can't speak for her altogether."

03:51:04 Evenia Callseah nods. "Well then we could just switch to seas batteries and that covers that."

03:51:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway, if you don't have access, I can move parts over."

03:51:20 Melinda says to Lily, "Well, the faster you get that heartfelt apology out there, the faster this gets sorted."

03:51:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:51:47 Melinda Michaels says, "And please be careful in the future. I don't want to have to deal with this mess again."

03:51:48 Evenia Callseah says, "I don't think I have access to the seekers warehouse. I feel like I only have access to seas and invaders on new earth."

03:52:03 Nissi Valdaire asks, "Yeah, I guess that's it for station issues then. Is everybody satisfied? Anything else to bring up?"

03:52:04 Melinda Michaels says, "In fact, I won't. If it keeps happening, I am done."

03:52:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.

03:52:35 Melinda says to Lily, "You aren't satisfied?"

03:52:35 "Can I agree with you and not seem like super bitch II?" Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:52:41 Nissi Valdaire grins.

03:52:43 Johann says to Nissi, "I have one small detail for you and Melinda I want to start thinking about at any rate, but nothing that requires everyone here."

03:52:57 Lily says to Evenia, "Ok well jsut let me know what you'd need from Starseekers. I still have some fission Breeders in Seas warehouse too."

03:53:02 Nissi Valdaire nods to Johann Schraft.

03:53:39 Melinda says to Lily, "When the new one is published, get the book and use it."

03:54:02 "I will 'we'll figure out all that after your post." Evenia Callseah nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Also good luck with that, I hope it's received as well as it can be. It's been a tough couple of months for everyone, and emotions have run high."

03:54:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I want to thank you all for your time and I want to express my sincerest appreciation for us coming together to discuss things."

03:54:14 Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yes, good luck."

03:54:26 Johann Schraft says, "Discussions are wonderful things."

03:54:28 Johann Schraft grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:54:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Evenia Callseah.

03:54:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a faux wood padded chair.

03:54:55 Nissi Valdaire says, "Thanks for making the time."

03:55:02 Melinda Michaels nods. "Yup, thanks."

03:55:02 Lily says to Nissi, "Thank you."

03:55:09 You stand up from a faux wood padded chair.

03:55:09 Evenia Callseah says, "Of course. I was glad to."

03:55:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And thank you all."

03:55:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at you thoughtfully.

03:55:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:55:30 You wave. "Thank you all for your time."

03:57:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs.

03:57:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What a bunch of mean people."

03:57:26 You nod.

03:57:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:57:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:57:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:57:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But it's ok we'll do what we have to."

03:57:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Three metal rich asteroids in a row."

03:57:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

03:57:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:57:38 You say, "Yeah, exactly."

03:57:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

03:57:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nice!"

03:57:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:57:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:57:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:57:51 Which sector did you mean?

03:57:51 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

03:57:52 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:57:52 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:57:53 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:57:56 The computer reports that the two-person heavy launch vessel "Registered Merchant 506" has jumped into the sector.

03:57:56 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:57:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:57:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:57:59 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:59:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:59:03 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:59:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:59:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:59:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:59:20 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:59:20 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:59:22 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:59:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident picks up a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

03:59:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:59:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a day old slice of three-meat pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

04:00:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

04:00:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Jsut wanted to get her fed."

04:00:28 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:00:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:00:41 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

04:00:41 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.

04:01:36 Lily says to you, "Soyou see what I mean? How they gang up and twist something to mean what they want it to?"

04:01:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You never intended anything regarding war."

04:02:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When they should lean on morris and tell him to get an attitude adjustment."

04:02:50 "WEll, I said we may not." You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I never said we would."

04:03:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Which they essentially did but they had to make something out of this rather than jsut sotp and consider that you were only pointing out how this could create a lot of unnecessary friction."

04:03:59 You say, "He could have said a thousand other things that would have been better, but he said something sarcastic. Hell, he could have said something like, just making sure you are awake, and I probably would have laughed."

04:04:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Seriously."

04:04:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Also this business of asking you to leave is really not his option so I would certainly ignore that in the future."

04:04:47 You say, "I well understand that riendly fire happens. Hell, I know I've accidentally tracked the wrong ship."

04:05:02 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:05:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Don't be nasty and I know you won't. Just saying. Just be there if you want to and he can't stop you."

04:05:20 You say, "That's essentially what Nissi said too that it was not a demand to leave."

04:05:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Just like the other day. I think he had what three spots to fill a cruiser?"

04:05:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We didn't kno w if he was willing to go under-crewed."

04:05:51 You nod.

04:06:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "If he would have said that, then we both would have volunteered. Still what's wrong with us wanting to have a little fun in this great Flare?"

04:06:32 You say, "Exactly."

04:08:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:16:19 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

04:20:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Subject: My Apology - i am Truly Sorry
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 02:55 28 September 2317 GST
--
Hello Everyone,
After a lot of personal angst over the past several weeks, I feel that I must say to you all how truly sorry I am for my behavior. Although I know some have mis-understood my intentions, I do forgive you for this.
I'm sorry to Eli and to Ather for letting you down during the protest against Outccord and I should have ignored my own drive to serve to keep things going in 777 and i should have just turned around.
I apologize to Johann and Evenia as well.
I apologize to everyone else for dragging you all into this mess and i will do whatever i can to avoid any future infractions.
I mean what I say in sincerety.
Kind regards,
Lily Kaise

05:01:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I didn't want to address the issue with Evenia and us at that meeting. I will try to let it go but I think she does need to understand how shocking I found that to be becasue I thought she respected our relationship."

05:02:46 "I appreciate you not bringing it up." You nod. "I think right now we just need to let go of the past and try to earn each others trust in the future. I'll still limit my time with Evenia for a while."

05:03:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

05:05:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I really trusted Evenia and I wanted to always be there to defend her but when she didn't so much as explain what the issue was, nor did anyone else, I just felt as though she was being spiteful."

05:05:56 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I definitely understand."

05:06:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:06:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I mean how would they feel if we took a transporter over there and unloaded all of our modules which we had pledged?"

05:06:44 You nod. "I agree."

05:07:19 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

05:07:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't think they would be happy without some sort of an explanation or at least an opportunity to defend their case."

05:39:52 You say, "Yeah, I'm sure."

05:40:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So obviously Melinda believed it or just chose to for her own convenience."

05:40:25 You say, "She just probably chose to believe it."

05:41:21 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

05:42:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am not shy about the fact that I dislike him but as I pointed out, it is a business arrangement so if Melinda specifies taht he is on or Jole is on or they take turns, then that's fine.

05:45:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "A sad but true reality and heh who isn't acting in good faith?"

05:45:15 You exclaim, "No kidding!"

05:46:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am probably one of the most transparent humans in this Universe. But the ones who aren't are so prone to discount me."

05:46:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

05:46:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok. I tried and I believe I've done my share so the ball is in their court now."

05:46:40 You say, "Well, people do what they'll do."

05:47:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So if they find another excuse, then we'll just go our own way."

05:47:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I had to try though."

05:48:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I so wish Constantine would have been there though to see for himself what we deal with day after day."

05:48:30 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Me too."

05:53:43 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

05:53:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

05:54:53 Lily says to you, "Ok ready to go lie down Love?"

10:17:28 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

10:31:52 [MTTS] usfolks: Ok...this is a dumb question, and I ask probably more because I'm working on not enough sleep, but...by third tier processors, that means the enhanced, right? Basic isn't considered some zero tier or something?

10:36:01 [MTTS] davetaylor: I guess so, I don't think I've ever heard them described that way though.

10:36:27 [MTTS] usfolks: Well I didn't think so, but my sleep-deprived brain tends to make things much more complicated than they really are.

10:36:36 [MTTS] Butchulla: If I remember the conversation from earlier correctly, it does mean that processor.

10:36:46 [MTTS] usfolks: Ok. Thanks.

10:37:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Also, if any hosts are around, I love the notification that no more poachers are incoming. That's an awesome addition.

10:37:34 [MTTS] davetaylor: I'm going to love that notification too, that is awesome.

10:38:05 [MTTS] usfolks: You guys have been giving us some amazing things lately. And we're very, very grateful.

10:38:28 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

10:39:05 [MTTS] davetaylor: I have to agree with that, with that, the gradual but stable changes, and the briliant plot lines, SC is the best.

10:39:13 [MTTS] usfolks: Amen to that.

10:40:41 [MTTS] voyager1000: It was said earlier that the idea was to make more of the buildings have purpose, and as far as I know, most people stick to the first two processors, so third would be the actual third, or second researched.

10:41:09 [MTTS] davetaylor: I wasn't around for said conversation sadly, as mining is one of my favourite things.

10:41:11 [MTTS] usfolks: Thanks Voyager1000. That's what I was thinking, but I'm working on 2.5 hours sleep.

10:42:01 [MTTS] voyager1000: No worries.

10:44:35 [MTTS] usfolks: Now I have to admit that a 'faster research' upgrade would be fucking awesome.

10:45:11 [MTTS] davetaylor: Agreed.

10:46:28 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

10:49:11 [MTTS] Ulias: Sorry couldn't respond, enhanced is the tier 3 one. The info on it has actually been changed to include the bit about radioactive stuff.

10:49:25 [MTTS] Ulias: Er. Enahnced is the tier 3 one, Imean.

10:50:04 [MTTS] usfolks: Ugg! Now I see that. I have a habit of not reading an entire line if I see the info I need because my eyes don't focus and have a small field of vision. Ok...now I feel REALLY dumb. Heh.

10:50:25 [MTTS] usfolks: So thank you so much Ulias. And everyone else too.

11:00:32 [MTTS] davetaylor: Ah, I've just noticed the changes to mining, they didn't show up in my changelog new for some reason.

13:43:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

13:43:03 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.

Although plasma is the best agent to unleash upon Bari, come one and come all! Bring any battlesuit you have and we will show those Bari not such a good time! We'll meet in the new Earth lounge to determine how many are present and call out for other participants if we don't have at least a Repair suit plus damage suits. - Lily Kaise.

I love how, in the same breath where you try to explain how you've seen your mistakes, you decide to throw in an I forgive you for misinterpreting me. I feel pretty confident in saying that you're not sorry at all and just want back on stations.

I agree with Erik. I actually thought that before he said anything. I held back thinking I might have been overreacting. I'm more sure now than ever that you're only interested in stations.
If it were my decision, I'd insist you had to wait at least six months because as people keep saying, words are meaningless. It's those actions that tell people everything we need to know about how sorry you really are.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.

The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.

* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions

Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.

Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."

Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.

Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.

Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.

Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are seeking new treaties.

Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.

In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeti
23:23:46 ng should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.

Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.

The Current Term

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

The current civilian term started on 21 August 2317 GST. Time remaining: 3 days, 2 hours, 39 minutes, and 55 seconds

23:35:56 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:43:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I echo the sentiment. I haven't been tuned into general when I've been around and I haven't even been around much, but I'm sure everyone's talking about how I over reaccted when Morris's cruiser fired on my ship."

23:44:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Over reacted, that is."

23:44:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

23:44:44 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

23:45:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Thos ner-du wells."

23:45:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No idea, I haven't worked up the nerve to face people yet. One person mentioned it ot me over the phone, but that's about it."

23:45:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Actually if you hadn't sent me a letter about it I'd have never known. It was never really mentioned."

23:45:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If I had not said I forgive others, then he would bring that up. You can't please everyone."

23:45:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, well."

23:45:39 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:45:41 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:45:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I had no idea about it until someone asked me and I had to tell them I didn't know what they were talking about."

23:46:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I didn't even read ford's post it's not worh bothering with."

23:46:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, Nissi said that it was probably my fault that I even got hit in the first plae, but I seem to recall that the cruiser locked and then fired at my ship. For a while my ship was the only one they fired at."

23:47:10 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Don't. It's really not worht it."

23:47:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'nope."

23:47:17 You say to Lily, "I read it already."

23:47:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You see I know no matter what I would say, someone will find fault with it because they have their own mindset."

23:47:54 You say, "I know."

23:48:36 You say, "And now, I'm even more convinced that Morris's ship's accidental fire on firestorm, wasn't really accidental."

23:48:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am sincere in what I said but I felt it was important to say that I forgive others as well otherwise what he said makes no sense because if I just wanted back on stations, then I'd say well screw you all."

23:49:13 You say, "Yeah, or he doesn't know you very well. But then again, very few AEU pilots like Eric."

23:49:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Wow wait too was he in a Cruiser?"

23:49:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I thought it was a hammerhead."

23:50:19 You say, "No, he was in a cruiser when that happened. And their claim that I accidentally moved where they had already begun firing is bullshit. I remember my tracking information updating and then we got locked on by the cruiser. Then we got hit."

23:50:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok well it's up to you how you want to explain that to Nissi if you think you can."

23:51:25 I don't understand that.

23:51:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps you should discuss it with Ather too though before you send the letter to see what his reaction is."

23:51:55 You say, "Well, it'd be better if Constantine can remember too as he would have seen the tracking information update."

23:52:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Maybe but you know he might have been focusing on his gunning."

23:52:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Certainly worth asking him though."

23:52:46 You say, "And I don't know if either of you remember, but the ship had just stopped right before we got hit. We were not moving or hadn't started to move yet."

23:52:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:53:08 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "That's true."

23:53:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't as I don't get much of that info in engineering. I just saw when we were hit."

23:53:39 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

23:55:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If anyone cares for whatever irrelevant and stupid reason, there's a transport that probably has some felo corpses on it."

23:55:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, is it Silver Starlight?"

23:55:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "New earth garage. I figured I'd let the weaklings with the soft hearts handle it. If that's none of you, you can let someone else know!"

23:55:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."

23:56:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The thing is they are basing everything on my post but they weren't present for th e meeting. I know I was sincere during the meeting and I did apologize there as well so these people sure don't know what's in my head and how I feel about things. They just have their own agenda, no matter what."

23:56:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, Eva asked me to feed those but since she was just here the day before yesterday I didn't think I needed to. Maybe it has a meanie."

23:56:23 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I totally understand."

23:56:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh well. Don't really care. Not worth my time."

23:56:52 You say, "The majority of those who were at the meeting accpeted your apology."

23:56:57 You say, "Accepted."

23:57:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it sure seemed that they did."

23:57:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "She seemed to be practically skipping that the strike was over, so maybe she just forgot."

23:57:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I refuse to go back and forth with them too."

23:57:39 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

23:58:26 "It's really not worth your time." You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Emily has a personal vendeta against you, for whatever reason. And Eric is disliked by many of the AEU. So, don't' waste your time and energy on them."
