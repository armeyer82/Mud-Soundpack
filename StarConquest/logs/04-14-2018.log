-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

In an attempt to fix minor inconsistencies, several help files have been changed.  HELP LEAGUE POLITICS, HELP AEU POLITICS, and HELP FRINGE POLITICS have all been edited slightly, with HELP LEAGUE PARTIES, HELP AEU PARTIES, and HELP FRINGE PARTIES adding back a list of the various political entities in those alliances.  HELP ALLIANCE GOVERNMENTS has been removed, and in its place are HELP LEAGUE GOVERNMENT, HELP AEU GOVERNMENT, HELP FRINGE GOVERNMENT, HELP EAOS GOVERNMENT, and HELP MUTUALITY GOVERNMENT.  If anything still remains inconsistent, appears missing, or does not make sense relating to alliance governments, political parties, or the various forms of parliament, please let us know.

01:01 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

01:01 You blink heavily and then doze off.

01:02 Not much to see out there.

01:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:03 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

01:03 
AEU scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Pi-8" departed to AEU sector Cheyanne's Star (Beta-2) approximately 7 minutes ago.
AEU scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Epsilon-3" departed to AEU sector Cheyanne's Star (Beta-2) approximately 7 minutes ago.

01:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:03 New Earth Orbit (AEU) [Human Interalliance Space] (Security: Alpha-1)

01:03 The computer reports that the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lake" has landed on the planet New Earth.

01:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

01:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:03 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

01:03 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Endymion.

01:03 Via general sector communication, Endymion transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

01:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:03 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:03 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:04 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:04 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:04 You're already sitting.

01:04 You don't feel very sleepy at the moment.

01:52 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Can I get any interest in a low tier nest? Preferably one or twos?"

01:59 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"

02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Hi. So can anyone tell me how to transmit to another starship in the same sector as I am? I can't remember how to."

02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Just press the GEN button."

02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Thanks."

02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "But you will need to be in the Control Room of your starship."

03:34 [Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "And a interdictor to boot."

03:34 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm currently unable to assist."

03:35 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Best advise I can give you is take out the interdictors and get out, unless someone from the AEU is able to lend a hand."

03:39 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ather, you able to lend a hand with a merry band situation in orion?"

03:39 [Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes. Stand by."

03:40 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks. Hawthorn says 4 ships, one has a dampener and he's interdicted."

04:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Right. So these rats ships are refusing to show. I went to where Mr. Orientation officer told me to go, and... hmm."

04:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, it might be the sectors around that sector too. Make sure you read the mission text carefully."

04:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Yeah. I'll try that."

05:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

05:45 The computer is unable to locate your coordinates while you are not in open space.

05:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

05:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

05:45 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:45 You peer out...

05:45 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

05:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

05:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

17:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
