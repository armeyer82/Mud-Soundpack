-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:33 Lily says to you, "Would you have time for a few beacons?"

00:33 You say, "Sure."

00:33 You grin.

00:33 You say, "My flare is back at the torus though."

00:34 I don't see "lily" here.

00:34 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

00:34 You peer out...

00:34 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den", the two-person Accord gemini "Fearless", and the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 578" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

00:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:34 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:34 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

00:34 
EAOS transport "Registered Merchant 578" departed to EAOS sector Torus Corridor (Alpha-1) approximately 7 minutes ago.

00:34 There are no other ships in the sector.

00:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Category: Game Systems

Quests are tasks personally given to you by non-player characters, or NPCs.

To interact with an NPC, you would use the TALK command on him or her. Talking to NPCs that you see is a good idea! You never know what they might have for you.

Quests have a variety of requirements and there is no practical way to write a help file that covers all possibilities. Just remember to listen carefully to what the NPC tells you. They will often repeat information if you talk to them again.

As a roleplaying note, talking about quests is generally very out-of-character. For one thing, nobody talks that way -- if your dad told you to go down to the corner shop for a loaf of bread, would you tell everyone your dad had just given you a quest? Secondly, it makes very little sense for a person in the game world to require the same favor over and over again, so this means that the quests you've been given should be treated as a personal one-time task -- it does not make sense to talk ICly as if it is a repeatable task performed by everyone. This must simply be glossed over as a necessary conceit of a multiplayer roleplaying game.

For these reasons, and also so that everyone has an equal opportunity to enjoy figuring out their quests, it is against policy to share quest walkthroughs or puzzle solutions.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
