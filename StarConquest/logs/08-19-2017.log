00:13:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Intended to be on industry activities only."

00:13:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And strictly voluntary, of course."

00:13:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Obviously."

00:14:37 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

00:15:37 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

00:17:42 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Fat chance."

00:17:46 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I have plans that day."

00:17:58 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You'd better bring nice flowers too."

00:18:09 [General Communication] Joel Kringle chuckles.

00:24:35 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

00:24:37 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:28:29 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm not cheeting I just got my turrets broken by some nice friendly rats."

00:28:38 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

00:28:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

00:30:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, Ather made it sound like it wasnt volountary."

00:30:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, it is voluntary."

00:30:37 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

00:39:44 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station at Exploration Waypoint 33248 is shutting down.

00:41:24 You stroke the soft fur of Shine the big white glowing felo.

00:41:24 Shine the big white glowing felo purrs softly.

00:42:38 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a shark.

00:47:38 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders south.

00:50:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm barely alive."

00:50:32 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Damn."

00:50:34 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Next You'll Be Wanting Me To Name The Debris Too". The organization has earned 1,181,864.41 credits.

01:03:33 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Pretty obvious what they'll pick, gosh nissi!"

01:03:43 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'm actually hoping for the RATS."

01:03:52 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They will say "which ever you want to bring along" but they secretly want you to bring the spinward!"

01:03:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I really want to see what a rats suit can do."

01:04:03 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure sure suuuuuuure."

01:04:09 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm not even kidding."

01:04:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nanoplasm. Woo."

01:04:17 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I've never actually seen one in action."

01:04:28 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, RATS suits are loads of fun."

01:04:38 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not bad repairers, either."

01:05:05 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "GMG with rats and league is a blast."

01:05:36 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Has anyone ever done GMG with rats and spinwards?"

01:06:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Also, on my way. Just transfering this debris."

01:06:23 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I actually have been contemplating changing my setup with the RATS suit for a while now, but haven't gotten around to it. I'm curious to see how it might work with something like a defensive nanites/plasma combination."

01:06:40 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But yes, we have done glyphmakers with RATS and spinward."

01:07:02 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is it as awesome as it sounds?"

01:07:03 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's honestly probably my favorite combination."

01:07:35 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, RATS/League is OK, RATS/Mutuality is slightly better, but RATS/Spinward is a really good fit."

01:07:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:08:00 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I like RATS League."

01:08:23 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I actually would not choose RATS/League unless I had no other choice with my glyph partner."

01:08:24 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I had a blast with rats league, the couple times I did it."

01:08:41 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I guess we all have our preferences."

01:08:50 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "RATS/Mutuality or RATS/spinward make more colorfully quicker explosions than RATS/League."

01:09:13 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Meh, we blow up things quite fast with RATS League."

01:09:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have not had the chance to do GMG with someone with a spinward, so I can't give my opinion."

01:10:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm also a huge fan of junkbot and league. That's probably my favorite combination so far."

01:10:29 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Next You'll Be Wanting Me To Name The Debris Too". The organization has earned 1,244,057.63 credits.

01:10:48 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How does double muti go."

01:10:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think I'll like RATS/League once I'm more confident with it."

01:10:58 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Like it better I mean."

01:11:00 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I landed on RATS and League as a favorite too."

01:11:06 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, it's cool Evenia, since you pretty much set one another up. The spinward does a critical shot, while RATS does nanoblade or something, and it's pretty much an instant kill long as you don't get interrupted, or unless you're facing like, Templar. Plasma is arguably more efficient, because the bolt packs more of a punch and doesn't take too long to fire off but the RATS and spinward have more tricks up their sleeves when you're in a bind."

01:11:06 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "After trying a few combos."

01:12:03 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Erik, I imagine it'd go reasonably OK long as one or both have plasma."

01:12:08 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hmmm. Yeah, I can see how that'd be cool. I've really only ever seen a spinward in action like twice, so I forget what all they're capable of. But when you put it like that..."

01:12:27 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Plasma and similar abilities really speed things up in the graves, and incidentally require much elss ammunition."

01:12:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've known several folks do double Muties."

01:12:51 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Since usually, two bolts are more than enough to put down a target."

01:13:16 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles. "Now I wanna go to the graves."

01:15:55 [General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Hi Lettie Bye Lettie."

01:46:38 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:00:42 Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:06:06 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:06:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:06:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:06:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:06:12 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

03:30:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:30:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:30:18 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Registered Merchant 915! Welcome to home space!"

03:30:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses some buttons on the communication board.

03:30:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:45:23 --
Dear Tara,
As Founder of SEAS, I would like to extend an invitation to you to join SEAS.
I just wanted to let you know that we're still very eager to have you join SEAS. I also want to emphasize that we are a full facility organization with a well-equipped fleet of starships to rent as well as we have two cruisers which are supported and room for an additional cruiser for a qualified pilot.
We also have a Genetics Lab and a Range office for monitoring the iability of Temporary Space Stations.
There is no requirement of you to contribute earned Points or Credits. All contributions are voluntary as our primary goal is to help you to develop to your fullest potential. At some point when you feel that you would like to contribute towards organizational goals, you would be welcomed to but never required unless there was some unforeseen circumstance which depleted our resources. So far though, SEAS has nearly 30 billion of available credits plus ample balances in support and insurance funds. Shule and I have put a lot of effort towards building up SEAS so that we could help motivated newer pilots such as yourself. The only exception would be that when you become Cruiser qualified and SEAS takes on the responsibility to support your Cruiser, then we would appreciate credits contributed towards its support. We still want to assure that the Corps has enough Cruisers to aid in the defense of humanity so provided you are an active 
03:45:23 member, if your income level is still insufficient to contribute, unless SEAS budget could not sustain your Cruiser, then we would waive the credits contribution requirement.
Last, we are selective in who we will choose to recruit as members. Although we enjoy socializing, we are focused and serious about our work. We want our members to represent strong ethical values as well. Shule and I have been observing your progress and we believe that you represent these core values.
Last, i am pleased that you chose to participate in an Expedition. Although this Expedition was led by a Fringe Pilot and Exploration is not the mainstay of the Fringe, I am pleased that you were adventurous enough to participate.
We will look forward to the opportunity to add you as a member of SEAS.
Please contact Constantine, shule or myself when you are ready to join and we will invite you in.
Kind regards
Lily Kaise

07:03:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

07:03:26 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

16:12:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

19:36:06 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

19:36:17 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "We got to a point where we all had to repair for me not to die and I still died anyways cause we couldn't do damage. At least that's how I saw it."

19:40:01 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Don't rely on Spinwards that much. Try to do it without one too. We won't have a Spinward all the time."

19:40:09 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We're gonna try it."

19:59:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I do as well."

19:59:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Start a vector, go to sleep."

19:59:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Check if I've stopped when I wake up."

20:00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't have a rift drive, so I don't have the luxury of passing out like that. I was pretty mad at myself."

20:00:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How come?"

20:00:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do it when it's autovectoring too."

20:02:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've gone over 500 without finding any."

20:02:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But now I try to kind of space out my trips so that doesn't happen."

20:02:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And yeah, the rift drive makes coming back after doing that easy."

20:03:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've actually been out on this trip for over 24 hours now."

20:03:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The longest i've traveled between artifacts is 374 sectors."

20:04:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

20:04:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I was asleep."

20:04:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:04:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh."

20:04:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I kind of use artifacting as a way of working while I rest."

20:04:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:04:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So yes provided you still have enough charge or be sure to always carry charge boosters."

20:04:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah!"

20:07:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd like to put together some kind of artifacting trip during this next term."

20:07:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Out to a more distant field."

20:08:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:08:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I would like to help. Just depends on my availability for work. I know of some areas."

20:08:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome!"

20:09:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:09:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We need to take Shule's Carrier to get a Docking bay Upgrade at andy's. I wanted to take the org one but I didn't put certain Upgrades from farport so that's sort of out of the question on an indefinite basis. Anyway, there's an area not far form tom Town that we could go to."

20:09:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."

20:10:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:10:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So we could dock ships into the carrier but we'll need to see about a beacon for Shule's Carrier or it will be very tedious."

20:10:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And how do people generally go about doing this? I was thinking of rifting somewhere in a carrier with a module scout inside."

20:10:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

20:10:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So is that how we'd do it, then? Put a module scout with a passive beacon in the carrier?"

20:11:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:11:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well yes that is an alternative but it only leaves a limited amount of space for other ships since the standard capacity for a carrier without the Docking bay upgrade is 100 units and the scout takes up 60."

20:11:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "True."

20:12:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:12:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "However, a Beacon with charging ability would work."

20:12:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:12:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We couldn't take many scouts because those require 12.5 units."

20:13:08 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

20:13:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah. We could fit three, and then I could follow in a fourth."

20:13:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "And dock after you got the upgrade."

20:13:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alternatively."

20:13:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:13:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's a possibility but Shule and I would probably just bring Sightseers which only require 5 units."

20:13:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, interesting."

20:14:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I might qualify for a sightseer by the time we do this."

20:14:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would really save space."

20:14:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:14:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah ok yeah that's what I would recommend and then we could take 2 scouts."

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]
Via general sector communication, Endymion transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

20:46:31 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Endymion.

20:46:34 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:47:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:47:22 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:47:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

20:47:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:47:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:47:37 A flashing green light indicates that your news has been updated.

20:47:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:47:37 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:47:39 You scramble to your feet.

20:47:39 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

20:47:39 You exit the ship.

20:50:31 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:50:31 You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:50:33 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:50:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:50:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:50:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

20:50:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:50:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:51:01 Which sector did you mean?

20:51:01 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

20:51:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:51:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:51:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

20:51:06 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:51:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:51:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:51:09 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:51:10 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

20:51:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:51:12 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

20:51:13 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 127" has jumped out of the sector.

20:51:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:51:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:51:15 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:51:17 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

20:52:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

20:52:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

20:52:19 You peer out...

20:52:20 
[The Torus; Dock Beta]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, against the starry expanse of space, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. A sign indicates that the main concourse is to the west, and the doorway to a rare starship supply store is to the south, but it has been closed and securely locked.

Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of gray canvas sneakers, a pair of slim blue stone linen trousers, a short-sleeved navy and white madras plaid cotton shirt, a pair of white cotton briefs, and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your face, both eyes, and neck are left uncovered.

21:33:31 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:33:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
