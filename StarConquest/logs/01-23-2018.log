-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a black plastic tray of spider chow, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies across the toes here.

Fixed an issue where enemies could retain memory of a companion dying despite the encounter resetting.
   Posted 6 days, 9 hours, 52 minutes, and 26 seconds ago

Tired of searching for which person is running League in your ground combat squad? Want to know the energy of all the AEU suits in your team more easily? We have news for you!

Introducing GROUND COMBAT ROLES!

Simply type the 'ROLE' command in a battlesuit to assign your battlesuit a specific role that can be changed at any time. They give no real mechanical benefit, but sorts your squad appropriately for the purposes of telling what's what at a glance.
   Posted 5 days, 8 hours, 13 minutes, and 9 seconds ago
-----
The 'suitinfo' command now says what role a particular suit is, if one is assigned.
   Posted 5 days, 7 hours, 59 minutes, and 55 seconds ago
-----
Ground Combat adjustment: Snap Shot (an ability in the 'Offense of the Clans' module) now generates additional enmity, in keeping with their ability to augment the squad's tanking capabilities.
   Posted 5 days, 4 hours, 22 minutes, and 55 seconds ago

20:47 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

20:47 You kiss Lily Kaise.

20:47 You say to Lily, "Hi my love."

20:47 Lily says to you, "Hey love."

20:47 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

20:48 Lily says to you, "I have sad news. Mischief left us this morning."

20:48 You say, "Awww."

20:48 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

20:48 You exclaim, "I'll miss Mischief!"

20:48 You glance at your communicator's screen.

20:48 985,004.33 AEU credits from your trust fund have been released to you. [00:01 21 January 2318 GST]
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Attention pilots: the tracking station that was destroyed was apparently a tracking station on or orbiting hyperion. Investigators are still investigating the wreckage, but say that there's nothing we can do at the moment. I must personally caution you though, that this could be a step towards occupation of Hyperion by outside forces. Such happened several years back, when a Mule, which was at the time registered to a Mutuality pilot landed droids fashioned by Agnar, as well as troops in specialized battlesuits to help a group of Sepritists try to take over the planet. In that situation, a building of hostages were taken, and when we went to try to free them, they were all apparently killed. All this to say, remain vigilant, and be ready in case we might have to launch to defend that region from possible attack by any faction. [02:00 21 January 2318 GST]
There are two board posts.
There are six headlines.

20:49 Lily Kaise says, "Yep I came back here after tesla. I found her and petted her and hugged her. Then when I came back in about a half hour ago, I found her collar and tail ribbons."

20:49 You say, "Awww."

20:49 Lily Kaise says, "She was a great pet. I sure will miss her."

20:49 You say to Lily, "I'm so sorry babe."

20:50 Lily says to you, "Thanks love."

20:50 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back..

20:50 Lily gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.

20:51 You say to Lily, "I've missed you."

20:51 Lily Kaise beams at you.

20:51 Lily says to you, "I sure have missed you too Love."

20:51 You beam at Lily Kaise.

20:52 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

20:52 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

20:52 Lily Kaise says, "I've just worked really hard with bringing the org's Industry up. We only need hmm I guess around 141 points to get to 7500."

20:52 You say, "Oh wow! I'll help too soon. I promise."

20:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh that would be most appreciated!"

20:53 You kiss Lily Kaise.

20:53 Lily Kaise says, "It seems Tara must have been around but I haven't seen her but now we can only contribute up to 25 percent so makes it slower."

20:53 You nod.

20:53 You say, "Ok."

20:54 Lily Kaise says, "At least if we can meet this goal prior to when the current salvage processor goes offline, then we can get a more advanced Salvage Processor for the next station."

20:54 You say, "Oh ok. That would be good."

20:54 Lily Kaise nods.

20:55 Lily Kaise says, "I would just prefer including other aEU organizaitons though."

20:55 Lily Kaise says, "I did write a letter to Kim asking if they wanted in and I asked Ather awhile ago in writing but he hasn't said anything so I'm assuming he is not interested."

20:56 You say, "Ok."

20:56 You say, "And I haven't seen Kim around much."

She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
