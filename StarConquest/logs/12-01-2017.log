00:58 Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec.

In the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller, somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window, where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'

04:09 [General Communication] Damien Alexander, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "Didn't see anybody in the usual places so I went back to the ship."

04:09 You kiss Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

04:09 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Fine I shall go be social."

04:09 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec laughs.

04:09 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec chuckles.

04:10 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Goodbye snn."

04:10 You say to Lily, "And if you wanted to try something like being with another woman, I wouldn't stop you."

04:10 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:10 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:10 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "See I am somewhat distracted by the most awesome man in the universe!"

04:11 You chuckle.

04:11 You grin.

04:11 You say to Lily, "I'm not that closed minded either. If you wanted to try being with another woman, I certainly wouldn't stop you."

04:12 Lily says to you, "Well, I think I told you awhile back that Melinda wanted to date me but I didn't reciprocate. That is likely the underlying issue with us. It does make me sad in that respect that she can't accept this in that I wasn't rejecting her. It, for me was a lifestyle preference."

04:13 You nod to Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

04:13 You say, "I'd be sad too as you'd probably break up with me if that happened, but if it makes you happy. Then it'd be the best for you."

04:13 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "So it's highly unlikely. I just was saying that I don't hold other's lifestyle decisions against them."

04:14 You say, "Oh I know. Just like I said, I know you are not into threesomes, but don't hold it against others if it's their choice."

04:14 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Right."

04:14 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I don't."

04:14 You say, "That's good, because then we wouldn't be dating."

04:15 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Heh one time when you and I were over here, Tabi suggested it but I didn't acknowledge."

04:15 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:15 You ask, "Oh really? Suggested a threesome?"

04:16 Lily says to you, "I'd hope that if that is what you wanted, that we'd discuss it first as I likewise would want to feel compatible and comfortable with the other party."

04:16 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I wouldn't dare introduce a third party if you weren't comfortable with them."

04:17 You say to Lily, "Oh honey. Of course I would, but I really wouldn't expect you to say yes."

04:17 Lily says to you, "Yeah because tabi and I go back to when I was a new pilot but we were never together."

04:18 You say to Lily, "I wouldn't even bring it up as I'm 99 percent sure you'd say no to that kind of thing. But of course, both of us would have to be comfortable."

04:20 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:20 You say to Lily, "And I wouldn't want to lose you by suggesting something like that."

04:21 Lily says to you, "Well because there are so few pilots that I would even consider. This is why I just don't even want to go there."

04:21 You say to Lily, "I don't know Tabi well enough to know if I'd be comfortable."

04:21 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec nods to you.

04:21 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I understand."

04:21 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec kisses you.

04:21 You kiss Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

04:22 You say, "I've been in one threesome before, and yes, it was with everyone's consent. But I never even dreamed of suggesting it to you."

04:24 You say to Lily, "Would you break up with me if I wanted to?"

04:25 You blush.

04:25 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:25 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well I have to say that I prefer just what we have. I really don't feel the need for anything more."

04:25 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec kisses you.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

04:26 You say, "Sorry, I missed what you said."

04:26 You kiss Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

04:27 Lily says to you, "I just said that I have to say that I prefer just what we have. I really don't feel the need for anything more."

04:28 I don't see that here.

04:28 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

04:30 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:30 You say to Lily, "I'm sorry for even bringing that up. I love you so so so much and I wouldn't want you to ever feel like I love you less. I wouldn't ever want to lose you."

04:31 Lily says to you, "Oh I understnad Love. It's been an interesting discussion."

04:31 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec smiles at you.

04:32 You smile at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

04:33 You say to Lily, "I love seeing you be all sexy and sexual and yes, I wish we could be more intimate more often, but that's our schedules, not our love for each other that limits that."

04:33 Lily nods sadly.

04:34 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec exclaims, "Yeah I agree Love because it has nothing to do with whether or not I enjoy having sex with you. It's quite the opposite!"

04:34 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec giggles at you.

04:34 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Or just being close and intimate like now."

04:35 You say, "To be quite frank, if you weren't able to be around for months.. I'd be tempted to be with someone else just for the affection, but my heart would always be with you. I'd resist though as I know you wouldn't like it."

04:35 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:35 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec, pulling her close.

04:35 You kiss Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

04:37 You say, "Sorry, I probably shouldn't have said that."

04:38 Shule looks embarrassed.

04:38 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Well I'm glad you're being honest."

04:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:39 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I am just very loyal. I recognize that I may feel lonely but unless I knew you weren't ever coming back, I'd never go to anyone else."

04:39 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I'm sure that is why Johann held out for so long."

04:40 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:40 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "He loved Brynn so very much."

04:40 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "He probably stil does."

04:40 You nod.

04:40 You say, "I'm sorry."

04:41 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "He showed me a book she gave him as a wedding present. I wish I would have read it but I felt embarrassed to read it."

04:41 You nod.

04:41 You say, "Like I said, I'd be tempted, but I know I'd lose you if you came back and found out."

04:42 Lily says to you, "It's ok. I can't make you different from how you are."

04:42 You say, "No, but you deserve someone who would be loyal to you. As loyal as you are."

04:44 Lily says to you, "Well I don't think you aren't loyal though. I just think you don't always consider how damaging it can be if you divert your affections to someone else and then I were to return. Then what would you do? How would you explain to the other person you hhave involved yourself with?"

04:44 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec asks, "Or how would you explain it to me?"

04:45 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:45 You say to Lily, "Well, first I would tell them upfront that my heart is still with you and that if you returned, I'd leave them that minute and go to you. If they weren't ok with that, I wouldn't go anywhere near them."

04:46 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec asks, "I see well don't you think that might make them feel rather discounted though?"

04:47 You say, "Then I wouldn't get involved with them unless they were ok with that arrangement. Sorry, but it's the only way I would. If they wanted a long-term relationship with me, that's not something that could happen. They'd have to understand and agree to that condition."

04:47 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "I see."

04:48 You say, "Just like with a threesome, the third person would have to understand that you and I come first and to have no expectations of a long-term relationship with us. IF they weren't ok with that, then it doesn't happen."

04:49 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec nods.

04:49 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec kisses you on the lips.

04:49 You say, "Not that I'm considering a threesome. I'm just giving an example."

04:52 Shule frowns at himself.

04:53 Lily says to you, "Naa you don't."

04:54 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec, pulling her close.

04:54 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:54 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec smiles at you.

04:54 You say to Lily, "I'm so so so sorry. You probably have a very strange `view of me now."

04:54 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "No not really. We've already had similar discussions."

04:55 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

04:55 You say, "Yeah, but I've never said that."

04:56 You say, "I'm sorry. I miss said something. I meant that they'd have to understand and agree that you come first. Not you and I come first. That only you come first."

04:59 You kiss Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec softly on the neck.

05:00 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

05:01 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Shule no it should always be that we come first."

05:02 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Our love for one another comes first."

05:02 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "But if I'm faced with imvolvement with someone else, then yes you come first."

05:02 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec smiles at you.

05:03 You smile at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec. "Exactl, but you are the most important thing to me and comes first."

05:03 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec beams at you.

05:03 Lily says to you, "An dyou are the most importnt thing to me so you come first too."

05:04 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Or the most imortant person, not thing as you are a person, not merely a thing."

05:05 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

05:05 You beam at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

05:06 Shule gives you a long, passionate kiss.

05:07 Lily says to Lily, "Gives you a long... passionate kiss in return."

05:07 Lily gives you a long ... passionate kiss in return.

05:08 You beam at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

05:08 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec squeezes you affectionately.

05:08 You say to Lily, "And of course, I would never do anything unless we expressly agreed on it."

05:09 Lily says to you, "Likewise."

05:09 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec smiles.

05:10 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

05:10 You say to Lily, "So why did you say no to Tabi? Because you wouldn't be comfortable with him or the activity?"

05:10 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Yeah and I wasn't totally certain if I would be comfortable with him."

05:10 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "But it was mostly for you too."

05:10 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec smiles.

05:11 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Alright, NQ peeps, I'm going to sleep. Please remember to leave me a note of your presence on board. Goodnight."

05:12 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:12 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec transmits, "We'll do that or be there prior to departure in ample time."

05:12 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec, pulling her close.

05:13 I don't understand that.

05:13 You say to Lily, "Well, next time. Talk to me about it."

05:13 I don't see that here.

05:13 You smile at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

05:14 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Sounds like a plan."

05:15 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

05:16 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Ok well, as I say it was sort of a non-starter with me though."

05:16 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

05:16 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec smiles at you.

05:17 You say to Lily, "If you had been comfortable, I would have been probably ok with him touching your breasts, but since you don't like me touching your butt, I wouldn't have wanted him to touch below the waist."

05:20 Hot, steaming water continues to bubble all around you.

05:22 Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec says, "Ok Love, well I doubt this will ever happen. I was just saying what happened at that particular point in time."

05:22 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec. "I know."

05:23 You kiss Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec.

05:23 You say to Lily, "Let's go lie down before we turn into prunes?"

[Starship "Distant Wanderer"; Weapons Room Two]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

17:46 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

17:46 A massive gas giant floats here, close to a bright white dwarf star. Its surface is aboil with whorls of cloud and angry red storm centers.

17:46 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:46 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:56 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Meow the little calico CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.

21:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:51 The ship is already moving.

21:51 The ship is already moving.

21:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:51 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

21:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:52 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:52 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
Lily Kaise, citoyen d'honneur du Nouveau Quebec is dozing on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

22:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:25 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "About seven Merry Band. Can't tell ship types."

22:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon B-19. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

22:25 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Any navy?"

22:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:25 Michael Kennedy's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah it doesn't show types."

22:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:25 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yes, two navy."

22:25 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:25 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
