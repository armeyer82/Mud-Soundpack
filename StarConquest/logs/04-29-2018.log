02:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
This planet seems to have a high ratio of water to land, but there are still two large land masses. Both are covered in mottled greens and blues that can only be life, seen through an odd orange haze.

02:27 FCI Scout Lily Kaise walks in.

02:27 You peer out...

02:27 
[Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Landing Area]
This is a large, flat area, a surface of what appears to be concrete, A dark green mold seems to have worked its way into every pore of it. Large building- or starship-sized mounds are also present on the large concrete slab, themselves covered in what appears to be a thick mat of dark green organic material. The air seems thick and soupy, and is tinged with a strange orange haze. Surrounding the concrete slab are tall tree-like organisms, thick-stalked and topped with umbrella-like structures the color of pale bloodless flesh. Smaller plantoid or fungoid life seems to thrive in the shadows of these larger organisms, even growing on the stalks. A rough-hewn path in the forest leads in the local equivalent of north.
The war galleon "Blackwing Yalobusha" and the stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" are landed here.
You can go north.

This is a large, flat area, a surface of what appears to be concrete, A dark green mold seems to have worked its way into every pore of it. Large building- or starship-sized mounds are also present on the large concrete slab, themselves covered in what appears to be a thick mat of dark green organic material. The air seems thick and soupy, and is tinged with a strange orange haze. Surrounding the concrete slab are tall tree-like organisms, thick-stalked and topped with umbrella-like structures the color of pale bloodless flesh. Smaller plantoid or fungoid life seems to thrive in the shadows of these larger organisms, even growing on the stalks. A rough-hewn path in the forest leads in the local equivalent of north.

02:30 You peer north...

02:30 
[Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Main Thoroughfare]
A wide path through the strange forest continues north for a short distance, then takes a turn roughly northeast. Toward the south is the landing area. To the east is another concrete slab, this one covered with loud machinery that rattles and belches black smoke. Humanoid organisms seem to toil amongst the machines. They are pale green in color, each with a thick black mane covering its head and shoulders and completely naked. An orange horn or antenna extends from the top of the head. The umbrella forest puts part of the slab in shadow, but many of the humanoids are toiling in the sun, dripping with sweat but apparently uncomplaining -- in fact, they seem to be working in complete silence.
You can go northeast and south.

02:31 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "I didn't hear Keegan."

02:31 Kani Kahakai toggles a small switch on the front of her spacesuit to LOCAL.

02:31 Aisling the Fox says, "Turn local radio on."

02:31 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Personally, I love everything being blanketed in a lovely coating of biomass."

02:32 Ather Jammoa says, "You won't, Cheri."

02:32 Ather Jammoa says, "He wasn't on our galleon. His radio is tuned to the other galleon."

02:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Alas, can't hear team of other ship."

02:32 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Nissi Valdaire say, "I've seen very dirty bathrooms that look like this."

02:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "I've seen very dirty bathrooms that look like this."

02:32 Keegan crouches down, looking down towards the ground.

02:32 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "If you are on ship."

02:32 Ather Jammoa says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

02:32 Keegan Wantz nods to Nissi Valdaire.

02:33 Damien peers down the path.

02:33 The area seems eerily still, but there is a great deal of mechanical-sounding noise toward the north, where smoke rises into the air.

02:33 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well, we just need to find the repair and rearm desk and ask for directions."

02:33 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "There's, er, there's people up ahead."

02:33 Ather Jammoa smirks.

02:33 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "That seems unlikely."

02:34 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the south followed by Ather Jammoa, Ellen Roberts, Aisling the Fox, FCI Scout Damien Alexander, and Anfisa the Wanderer.

02:34 Ellen Roberts removes a bulky translation device from a rugged dark brown shoulder bag.

02:34 Jim Gruffudd nods to Ellen Roberts.

02:34 Ellen Roberts manipulates the bulky translation device and nods.

02:35 Ellen gestures at the humanoids.

02:35 A worker straightens from its task at a machine, stands still for a moment, then turns to another task.

02:35 I see no "machine" here.

02:35 FCI Scout Shule Elemmire looks curiously at the machines.

02:36 FCI Scout Damien Alexander watches the humanoids work, frowning.

02:36 Jim calls out, "Hello! We are here on a mission of peace!"

02:36 Looking side to side, Keegan Wantz fixates on the workers for a moment.

02:36 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys looks at Jim Gruffudd thoughtfully.

02:37 Some sort of flying creature lands nearby. It is pale blue with some sort of orange antenna. It stares in your direction for a moment, then flies away.

02:37 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn say, "I feel like I'm listening to a radio program save for it isn't fiction..."

02:37 Melinda Michaels glances first at the creature and then over at Damien.

02:37 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Extremely diligent workers."

02:37 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:38 Ellen Roberts says, "There are green, vaguely humanoid creatures. Unclothed, they're going about their business."

02:38 You nod.

02:38 Damien smiles momentarily as the winged creature lands and then departs again.

02:38 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "An industrial level of technology."

02:38 Another worker approaches the path at a deliberate pace. It pauses nearby, not making eye contact, then bends to drink from a barrel of water.

02:38 FCI Scout Damien Alexander glances at Melinda Michaels.

02:38 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Very absorbed in their work, so very much."

02:38 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "It's like they aren't even acknowledging our presence."

02:38 Keegan Wantz says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

02:38 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Kani Kahakai say, "I am beginning to develop a suspicion..."

02:38 Kani Kahakai says, "I am beginning to develop a suspicion..."

02:38 Aisling the Fox says, "They notice us but seem apathetic."

02:38 Ather Jammoa says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

02:38 Nissi Valdaire peers at the alien. "Umm. Hello?"

02:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well, the blue thing was different."

02:39 Damien says to Kani, "I got a suspicion too."

02:39 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:39 Ather Jammoa says, "Didn't look like the same ones, but it was a flying creature."

02:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Maybe was just a bird."

02:39 The worker straightens, turns, and returns to its task.

02:39 Aisling the Fox frowns.

02:39 You say, "They really don't seem to be paying any attention to us."

02:39 Melinda smiles at the worker, "hello."

02:40 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "At least they don't seem scare of us."

02:40 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "Er, scared."

02:40 You say, "This is true."

02:40 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Wendy Arroyo say, "A planet full of clones of my ex."

02:40 Wendy Arroyo says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

02:40 You nod to FCI Scout Damien Alexander.

02:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

02:40 Ather says to you, "Tune your radio to local."

02:40 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Jim Gruffudd say, "Let's... let's move on. There are settlements ahead."

02:40 Jim Gruffudd says, "Let's... let's move on. There are settlements ahead."

02:40 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:40 Aisling the Fox says, "Hum, clones. You might not be far off."

02:40 Over your spacesuit radio, FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn sighs.

02:40 You nod.

You can go northeast and southwest.
A hovering holo recorder floats in behind Georgie Grizzel.

02:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the southwest followed by Ather Jammoa, Ellen Roberts, Aisling the Fox, FCI Scout Damien Alexander, and Anfisa the Wanderer.

02:40 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

02:41 One of the green-skinned humanoids emerges from one of the earthen mounds. It pauses, apparently looking at nothing in particular.

02:41 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Yup tempted to go sleep until we get back."

02:41 Ather Jammoa says, "They have green skin, horns or antennas. Could be a sex difference."

02:41 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn say, "Nah, nah, that's not why I'm sighing I'm feeling...like there might be something wrong here."

02:42 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Kani Kahakai ask, "They all share that horn-antenna organ thing, even the bird. If they're not especially attentive to their immediate surroundings... maybe they're... umm... handshaked?"

02:42 Kani Kahakai says something, but the sound is muffled by your spacesuit helmet and you can't quite make it out.

02:42 Melinda Michaels glances at the creature with a thoughtful look on her face.

02:42 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Morris Corlew say, "Maybe they're telepaths."

02:42 A pair of humanoids approaches from the northeast, walking straight toward you and the team. They stop nearby and stand still.

02:42 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "No idea."

02:42 Anfisa the Wanderer asks, "Hello?"

02:42 FCI Scout Shule Elemmire smiles at the pair of humanoids.

02:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Much welcome."

02:43 One of the humanoids lets out a deep, breathy rumble.

02:43 The translator crackles to life: "I am Hwoom-Hoom."

02:43 FCI Scout Damien Alexander smiles.

02:43 Ather turns his face briefly away to study the landscape as he murmurs something quietly into the radio.

02:43 After a moment, the second humanoid makes a similar sound.

02:43 Ather Jammoa says, "Stand by, we've been noticed and are making contact."

02:43 Kani Kahakai beams.

02:43 The translator says, "I am Hwoom-Hoom."

02:43 FCI Scout Damien Alexander arches an eyebrow.

02:43 Shule whispers quietly into his radio.

02:44 You say, "We are making contact."

02:44 Anfisa the Wanderer asks, "Ah... Is there an error in the translation equipment?"

02:44 Aisling the Fox frowns.

02:44 Ellen Roberts gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:44 Ellen Roberts opens a black leather hip holster for a moment.

02:44 Ellen Roberts removes a bulky handheld filing system terminal from a black leather hip holster.

02:44 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Nissi Valdaire say, "I am... Nissi."

02:44 Nissi Valdaire says, "I am... Nissi."

02:45 Ellen places the terminal on top of the translation device in order to hold both while still using the terminal.

02:45 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Morris Corlew say, "They can't hear you if you put it on ship. Only Local."
Ellen Roberts says, "Hm."

02:45 Ellen Roberts shakes her head at Anfisa the Wanderer.

02:45 Damien examines the two humanoids closely, trying to do so without staring in an obvious manner, looking for differences from one to the other.

02:45 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn say, "Oh, uh, right. Welp, understood."

02:45 Anfisa the Wanderer nods to Ellen Roberts.

02:45 Aisling calls out, "Are you all Hwoom-Hoom?"

02:46 One of the humanoids speaks again. "I am Hwoom-Hoom."

02:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Pleased to meet Hwoom-Hoom."

02:47 Damien murmurs, "Maybe it's not a name? It could be... a title or caste or something."

02:47 FCI Scout Damien Alexander shrugs helplessly.

02:47 One of the humanoids asks, "More in sky containers?"

02:48 FCI Scout Damien Alexander glances at Jim Gruffudd.

02:48 Wendy Arroyo glances back in the general direction of the impromptu landing pad, the motion somewhat awkward due to her spacesuit.

02:48 Melinda Michaels nods to Wendy Arroyo.

02:49 The other of the humanoids asks, "More in sky containers?"

02:49 Melinda glances tentatively between the humanoid who spoke and Jim Gruffudd.

02:49 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ask, "Nothing...did they unsuit?"

02:49 Shule speaks quitely into his space suit radio.

02:50 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Jim Gruffudd say, "There are more of us in the, ah, ships, yes."

02:50 Jim Gruffudd says, "There are more of us in the, ah, ships, yes."

02:50 You say, "No, we're still here and suited."

02:50 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn say, "Oh..."

02:50 Georgie Grizzel turns his hoverrecorder slightly, capturing the exchange.

02:50 Wendy says to Ellen, "So is that thing two-way or what?"

02:50 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Wendy Arroyo ask, "So is that thing two-way or what?"

02:51 One of the humanoids says, "Bring all. Come. Meet Hwoom-Hoom."

02:51 Ellen Roberts says, "It should translate us for them as well, yes."

02:51 Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

02:51 You smile.

02:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well..."

02:51 Melinda smiles at the humanoids.

02:51 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "That's very kind of you."

02:51 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Melinda Michaels say, "Thank you."

02:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Thank you."

02:52 Shule whispers into his radio.

02:52 You say, "They have invited all of us and welcomed us."

02:52 The other of the humanoids says, "Bring all. Come. Meet Hwoom-Hoom."

02:52 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Morris Corlew say, "That is indeed good news."

02:53 Shule smiles at the humanoids.

02:53 Anfisa of Marzore glances up to the sky and furrows her brow.

02:53 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Kani Kahakai exclaim, "Thank you!"

02:53 Kani Kahakai exclaims, "Thank you!"

02:53 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "No idea? I'm sitting here without a suit on so."

02:53 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz ask, "Curious. Some variety of central mind?"

02:53 Keegan Wantz asks, "Curious. Some variety of central mind?"

02:53 Georgie stares at the humanoids, his face alight with excitement.

02:53 Ellen checks something on the terminal.

02:53 Damien says to Keegan, "Could be."

02:53 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Morris Corlew say, "You can hear what's goin on kinda if you put your suit on and set it to local."

02:53 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Oh I need to go put my lizard up be right back."

02:53 Wendy glances down to the ground, scuffing her boot a little. Behind the helmet and her glasses, she's frowning thinly.

02:53 Ather glances around, his posture uncertain.

02:53 Ellen Roberts says, "The waveform appears to be consistent when they say the name."

02:54 Aisling the Fox asks, "So voices are exactly the same?"

02:54 Damien says to Ellen, "They have identical voices?"

02:54 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder. "Interesting."

02:54 Pierre-Louis frown slightly, glancing back toward the ship and then at the sky.

02:54 Ather Jammoa says, "The translator doesn't differentiate, but their...uh, speaking mannerisms seem to be similar."

02:55 Damien says to Ellen, "Only the name though? The rest is different?"

02:55 Ellen Roberts says, "Not exactly, but the waveforms match given the slight difference in each voice. Remember, the translator doesn't change tone or anything."

02:55 You ask, "Maybe it's the name of their society?"

02:55 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "Ah."

02:55 FCI Scout Damien Alexander nods to you. "Could be."

02:55 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Wendy Arroyo say, "One way to find out."

02:55 Wendy Arroyo says, "One way to find out."

02:56 Keegan Wantz nods.

02:56 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

02:56 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Jim Gruffudd say, "Yeah. Let's keep our wits about us, though."

02:56 Jim Gruffudd says, "Yeah. Let's keep our wits about us, though."

02:56 You nod to Jim Gruffudd.

02:56 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Yes."

02:56 Melinda Michaels nods.

02:56 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "I always do."

02:56 FCI Scout Damien Alexander nods to Jim Gruffudd.

03:00 Jim holds up a finger. "Remember, don't get greedy. We're just here to gather information, not find new life partners."

03:00 Morris Corlew grins at Jim Gruffudd.

03:00 You nod to Jim Gruffudd.

03:00 You say, "Understood."

[Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Cul-de-Sac]
You see a pair of pale green-skinned humanoids and a hovering holo recorder here.

03:02 FCI Scout Lily Kaise gives Melinda Michaels a thumbs up!

03:02 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "We can talk about that later."

03:02 a pair of pale green-skinned humanoids

03:02 These humanoids are both taller and bulkier than most of the workers around -- in fact, at least to a human eye, they look nearly identical. Like all of their species, they have pale green skin with a hint of scales, and dark hair that grows from the top of their heads to their shoulders, with a long mane hanging down their backs. They have forward-facing red eyes with vertical pupils, and a mouth that is too wide for human proportions with stiff lips that are just short of being able to be called a beak. They are completely naked but do not appear to have genitalia, just a hole between the legs that is, unfortunately, impossible not to notice. Small holes at the sides of the head may be nostrils or ears. Some sort of stiff orange horn or antenna grows from the top of the head. They have four fingers and toes on each hand and foot, each with a short, dull claw.

03:02 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Melinda Michaels say, "Yup."

03:02 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

03:02 The pair of humanoids move simultaneously, pushing past the fiber mat covering the entrance of the largest earthen mound and moving inside. The group of humanoids surrounding the entrance pay them no mind.

03:02 Morris Corlew joins Jim Gruffudd's group.

03:02 Kani Kahakai shrugs helplessly.

03:02 Ather Jammoa frowns.

03:02 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Nissi Valdaire say, "I um. Yeah."

03:02 Nissi Valdaire says, "I um. Yeah."

03:02 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Actually, I'll go back to the Cartes. I don't like leaving it."

03:02 FCI Scout Evenia Callseah gazes after the humanoids as they move.

03:02 Ather Jammoa says, "I don't like this."

03:03 Aisling the Fox nods to Ather Jammoa.

03:03 Keegan Wantz nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

03:03 Cheri Lindbergh leaves Jim Gruffudd's group.

03:03 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "...it's very...."

03:03 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Be safe!"

03:03 Jim Gruffudd nods.

03:03 Cheri Lindbergh walks southwest.

03:03 Katina Faye frettfully chews on her lip.

03:03 I see no "mound" here.

03:03 [Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Cul-de-Sac]

03:03 The main thoroughfare through the forest appears to end here, widening out into a larger clearing surrounded on all sides by the strange earthen mounds. A particularly large mound is present directly toward the northeast. A few of the pale green humanoids are standing out in front of it, almost entirely still, the group facing in no particular direction.
You see a hovering holo recorder here.
Jim Gruffudd, Georgie Grizzel, Nissi Valdaire, Keegan Wantz, Wendy Arroyo, Kani Kahakai, Melinda Michaels, FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn, FCI Scout Lily Kaise, Ali Candan, FCI Scout Johann Schraft, FCI Scout Damien Goss, Ted Warburton, FCI Scout Evenia Callseah, Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys, Ather Jammoa, Ellen Roberts, Aisling the Fox, FCI Scout Damien Alexander, Anfisa the Wanderer, Katina Faye, FCI Scout Tobias Hawthorne, and Morris Corlew are standing here.

03:03 Ted Warburton says, "It's different, for us, that's for sure, but I expected some kind of difference."

03:03 Ellen Roberts says, "It's good to be cautious, but they are alien.  Alien is usually unsettling at best."

03:03 Morris Corlew nods to Georgie Grizzel.

03:03 Ellen Roberts nods to Georgie Grizzel.

03:03 Morris Corlew nods to Ellen Roberts.

03:03 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mm."

03:04 Wendy Arroyo says, "Healthy touch of paranoia never hurts."

03:04 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Try not to make pre-judgments, right."

03:04 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:04 [Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Tunnel]

03:04 This is a tunnel dug into the earth, slowly descending downward. The soil is sun-baked and dry near the entrance, but grows damp and darker as the tunnel goes lower. Dark green plant-like fiber is woven into the soil like roots, keeping the tunnel from collapsing.
You see a pair of pale green-skinned humanoids and a hovering holo recorder here.

03:04 Humanoids line the sides of the tunnel, looking at nothing in particular. The pair that the team is following continue downward.

03:04 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Mm."

03:04 Keegan Wantz says, "Mm."

03:04 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Well... going deeper."

03:04 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Heh what do we have to lose anyway."

03:05 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Mm."

03:05 Keegan Wantz says, "Mm."

03:05 The pair of humanoids move off to the side and pause before a wall of the chamber, gazing vaguely at it.

03:05 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles.

03:05 [Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Underground Chamber]
This is a large chamber under the earth. It is damp and nearly completely dark here, lit only by the little sunlight that makes it down the entrance tunnel and spacesuit lamps. Every few seconds, a burst of warm air emanates through the chamber, along with a slight vibration and almost inaudibly deep sound, as if the earth is breathing. Thick fibers are underfoot, network that thickens as it leads towards the center of the chamber. At that center looms a large fleshy sphere, clearly organic, colored with striking red and blue striations. The sphere expands and contracts in time with the ever-present warm wash of air. More of the silent green-skinned, orange-horned humanoids are here, most apparently constantly toiling, though some are also lying down among the fibers on the floor.
You see a hovering holo recorder here.
Jim Gruffudd, Georgie Grizzel, Nissi Valdaire, Keegan Wantz, Wendy Arroyo, Kani Kahakai, Melinda Michaels, FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn, FCI Scout Lily Kaise, Ali Candan, FCI Scout Johann Schraft, FCI Scout Damien Goss, Ted Warburton, FCI Scout Evenia Callseah, Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys, Ather Jammoa, Ellen Roberts, Aisling the Fox, FCI Scout Damien Alexander, Anfisa the Wanderer, Katina Faye, FCI Scout Tobias Hawthorne, and Morris Corlew are standing here.
You can go southwest.

03:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Look at that..."

03:05 Alexander stares at the sphere. "Whoa."

03:05 Katina Faye rubs two fingers against her cheek.

03:05 Ted Warburton says, "Amazing."

03:05 FCI Scout Evenia Callseah gazes at the sphere in amazement.

03:05 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Well, I think this might confirm my idea."

03:05 Keegan Wantz says, "Well, I think this might confirm my idea."

03:05 Keegan Wantz coughs.

03:05 Over your spacesuit radio, Keegan Wantz coughs.

03:05 FCI Scout Lily Kaise closes a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

03:05 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Hmm."

03:05 Shule looks curiously at the sphere.

03:05 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:05 The large sphere in the center of the chamber expands slowly, then shrinks with a rush of air and a low rumble.

03:05 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "How is it formed you think?"

03:06 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Wow."

03:06 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Wow."

03:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "There is a nice fleshy sphere here."

03:06 FCI Scout Lily Kaise closes a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:06 Melinda watches the sphere with interest.

03:06 FCI Scout Johann Schraft closes a small black leather backpack.

03:06 FCI Scout Johann Schraft turns a small key in the lock of a small black leather backpack and then pockets the key.

03:06 FCI Scout Evenia Callseah says, "It's...I guess it looks like a breathing sphere."

03:06 Aisling the Fox says, "It is like a giant lung ball."

03:06 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Nissi Valdaire say, "I can't say this is what I expected to find."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I can't say this is what I expected to find."

03:06 Ellen Roberts says, "A large organic red and blue striated sphere that pulses."

03:06 Katina Faye asks, "Maybe like a brain?"

03:06 You nod.

03:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I am hoping it will not take over our minds."

03:06 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Melinda Michaels ask, "Air?"

03:06 Melinda Michaels asks, "Air?"

03:06 The large sphere slowly inflates and contracts again.

03:06 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Melinda Michaels say, "Ah ha."

03:06 Melinda Michaels says, "Ah ha."

03:06 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "But if it's a brain what makes it pulse."

03:06 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "It's kinda creepy, but it's more cool."

03:07 Katina Faye asks, "A heart then?"

03:07 You nod to FCI Scout Damien Alexander.

03:07 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Kani Kahakai say, "I think we're meeting Hwoom-Hoom."

03:07 Kani Kahakai says, "I think we're meeting Hwoom-Hoom."

03:07 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Mm."

03:07 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Morris Corlew say, "Lungs."

03:07 Morris Corlew says, "Lungs."

03:07 The translator comes to life: "I AM HWOOM-HOOM."

03:07 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

03:07 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "It's amazing. It's like the..."

03:07 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:07 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Attributing human ideas of organ- oh dear."

03:07 Keegan Wantz says, "Attributing human ideas of organ- oh dear."
Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:07 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Melinda Michaels say, "I am Melinda."

03:07 Melinda Michaels says, "I am Melinda."

03:07 Katina startles slightly.

03:07 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Wendy Arroyo say, "Score me one for Merida."

03:07 Wendy Arroyo says, "Score me one for Merida."

03:07 FCI Scout Damien Alexander nods to Kani Kahakai.

FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Greetings."

03:08 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Hello, I'm Hawthorn."

03:08 FCI Scout Johann Schraft says, "Hello. I am Johann."

03:08 One of the humanoids stumbles into the chamber. It seems to have gorged itself -- its stomach is distended -- and it has some sort of wet plant matter drooling from its mouth. It comes to a stop, wavers for a moment, then collapses on top of the thick network of fibers.

03:08 FCI Scout Evenia Callseah says, "Greetings to you, Hwoom-Hoom. I am Evenia."

03:08 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:08 FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "It's an honour to meet you, Hwoom-Hoom. I'm Damien Alexander."

03:08 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

03:08 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Oh dear."

03:08 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh dear."

03:08 Alexander glances to the new entry. "That don't look good," he mutters.

03:08 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Yes I hope they are all right."

03:08 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yes I hope they are all right."

03:09 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Morris Corlew say, "They look...full."

03:09 Morris Corlew says, "They look...full."

03:09 Melinda watches the humanoid, "huh, interesting."

03:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:09 Evenia glances toward the fallen humanoid with concern, but keeps her gaze mostly on the sphere.

03:09 Katina opens her mouth to try and say something, then closes her mouth and blushes shyly instead.

03:09 Alexander looks back to the sphere. "Is that person well?"

03:09 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Perhaps this is how they digest."

03:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Perhaps this is how they digest."

03:09 FCI Scout Damien Goss says, "Yes Cheri."
Morris looks around in quiet amazement.

03:09 FCI Scout Damien Goss says, "It seems so."

03:09 After watching the humanoid fall over, Keegan crouches down near one of the others, looking it over.

03:09 Hawthorn tenses slightly before he asks, "I can't tell if it's harmed or not..."

03:09 Ellen Roberts frowns.

03:09 Nissi eyes the fallen humanoid as she steps closer to Wendy's side.

03:09 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to FCI Scout Tobias Hawthorne.

03:09 Ellen Roberts says, "That is a distinct possibility."

03:09 Shule looks around the chamber.

03:09 Pierre-Louis smiles happily at the sphere, glancing at the exit to the room.

03:10 The room rumbles again, and the translator speaks: "REMOVE COVERINGS. ENJOY CONTACT."

03:10 Alexander blinks in surprise.

03:10 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles.

03:10 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Thank you for sharing."

03:10 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Thank you for sharing."
FCI Scout Damien Alexander says, "Er."

03:10 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Kani Kahakai say, "Hwoom-Hoom isn't making offhanded observation about our bodily functions.. oh."

03:10 Kani Kahakai says, "Hwoom-Hoom isn't making offhanded observation about our bodily functions.. oh."

03:10 Evenia gasps with surprise.

03:10 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:10 Over your spacesuit radio, FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:10 Keegan says to Lily, "Probably wait."
Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Probably wait."

03:10 Morris opens his mouth to say somethin, seems to think better of it, then chuckles quietly to himself.

03:10 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to Keegan Wantz.

03:10 Melinda Michaels nods. "Yes wait."

03:10 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Melinda Michaels say, "yes wait"

03:10 Keegan Wantz coughs.

03:10 Over your spacesuit radio, Keegan Wantz coughs.

03:10 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I can respect at least a portion of that statement."

03:10  You are wearing a gold spacesuit helmet, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, a black spacesuit top with a red star on the right shoulder, a pair of black spacesuit gloves with a gold stripe around each cuff, a black spacesuit bottom with a red stripe down the outside of each leg, and a pair of black spacesuit boots with a gold stripe down each side. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots, a blue knitted cap, a pair of white cotton briefs, and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a reactionless spacesuit jet, and a spacesuit navaid. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your face and both eyes are left uncovered.

03:10 You are carrying nothing.

03:11 Wendy looks down at herself, then back up, and back again. A moderately skeptical eyebrow is raised behind the visor.

03:11 The room rumbles. "PLEASURE IS ASSURED."

03:11 FCI Scout Lily Kaise smiles.

03:11 Morris clears his throat.

03:11 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise say, "Yes well..."
FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yes well..."
Alexander gives a quiet cough.

03:12 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear FCI Scout Lily Kaise ask, "The constitutional thing you know?"

03:12 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "The constitutional thing you know?"

03:12 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Do you know if it will do harm to our bodies?"

03:12 FCI Scout Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:12 Evenia clears her throat, glancing around her, down at herself, then up toward the sphere.

03:12 The large sphere inflates and contracts several times. "ENJOY PURE CONTACT."

03:12 Morris Corlew glances at Jim Gruffudd.

03:12 I don't see that here.

03:12 You glance at Jim Gruffudd.

03:12 Katina Faye gazes steadily at Jim Gruffudd.

03:12 FCI Scout Lily Kaise looks at Jim Gruffudd thoughtfully.

03:12 FCI Scout Damien Goss gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:12 Ather Jammoa's optics unit flashes lights rapidly in a blink behind his helmet as he glances towards Pierre-Louis.

03:12 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Jim Gruffudd say, "I, uh..."

03:12 Jim Gruffudd says, "I, uh..."

03:12 Over your spacesuit radio, you hear Keegan Wantz say, "Mmm.."
Keegan Wantz says, "Mmm.."

03:12 Anfisa the Wanderer says diplomatically, "Ah... Thank you for the offer, but..." Her voice trails off as she glances to Pierre-Louis and Nissi, seemingly checking their reactions.

03:25 Melinda Michaels says, "Outsiders would mess with his mind somehow. That sickness."

03:25 You nod to Melinda Michaels.

03:25 FCI Scout Damien Goss says, "Everone was talking and yelling. I'm sorry. A lot was going on."

03:25 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:25 Melinda Michaels nods to FCI Scout Damien Goss. "No problem."

03:25 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:25 Katina Faye removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a light blue flightbag with a gold shooting star on the side.

03:25 Kani Kahakai says, "It's hard to say how porous it is to organisms it absorbs."

03:26 Keegan Wantz says, "Fuck."

03:26 Kani Kahakai says, "It might be influenced a lot, or not at all."

03:26 Keegan Wantz asks, "Why didn't I shoot him sooner?"

03:26 Katina Faye asks, "Where is he?"

03:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "I'm for launching but somebody would need to tell the other ship."

03:26 Keegan sits down heavily, his back against the bulkhead.

03:26 Katina Faye says, "I will."

03:26 Morris Corlew says, "On Pierre's ship I think."

03:26 Katina Faye removes spacesuit components from a light blue flightbag with a gold shooting star on the side and quickly dons them.

03:26 Keegan Wantz nods to Katina Faye.

03:26 You say to Keegan, "No sense in worrying about it now."

03:26 Katina Faye wanders out.

03:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "Hope she cycles that airlock."

03:26 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to blue.

03:26 A small light on the airlock door turns from green to yellow.

03:26 Keegan says to you, "I was waiting for Jim to give me the okay."

03:26 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to red.

03:26 Wendy Arroyo says, "Also, dumb question, but something that maybe we should keep in mind."

03:27 You nod to Keegan Wantz. "I know."

03:27 A small light on the airlock door turns from red to yellow.

03:27 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Ccyle the other airlock too, Katina, for the decontamination."

03:27 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Aren't the hulls of our ships absolutely full of that crap?"

03:27 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Alright."

03:27 A small light on the airlock door turns from yellow to blue.

03:27 A small light on the airlock door turns from blue to green.

03:27 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:27 Keegan Wantz says, "Yes, but hopefully vacuum kills it."

03:27 Morris glances out the viewport.

03:27 Keegan Wantz asks, "If the Outsider is down here, is the Magistrate on the planet?"

03:27 Melinda Michaels says, "To quarantine with the ships."

03:27 Melinda Michaels says, "Good question."

03:27 Keegan Wantz asks, "Did we ever have anyone other than Zymnaz in Human space?"

03:27 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Also, back to the first question, isn't the ship automatically ventilated whenever it lands?"

03:27 Wendy Arroyo says, "Tell me I'm misremembering and it's the spaceport that does it."

03:28 Keegan says to Wendy, "Not if the air's no good, pretty sure."

03:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Well the COTS?"

03:28 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:28 Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:28 Wendy Arroyo says, "Okay, but the scanners were returning green."

03:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:28 Morris Corlew says, "Also as limited exposure only though."

03:28 You nod.

03:28 Keegan Wantz says, "They also were saying 'don't breathe this long term', so."

03:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "But who knos if they can detect everything."

03:28 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise. "That's true."

03:28 Kani Kahakai says, "Well."

03:28 Keegan Wantz says, "Other ship's still landed."

03:28 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Which is good thing we wore our suits at least."

03:29 You nod.

03:29 Wendy Arroyo says, "Wait until we hear from Jim and company."

03:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "We got an extra person."

03:29 Melinda Michaels points at FCI Scout Damien Goss.

03:29 FCI Scout Damien Goss nods.

03:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Did somebody give birth?"

03:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:29 You chuckle.

03:29 Keegan Wantz says, "No, Damien's from the other ship."

03:29 Kani Kahakai says, "The little green servitors took us all the way down to Hwoom-Hoom, might not be so bad farther away from the nerve center."

03:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I know just beeing and yeah well..."

03:29 You say to Lily, "No, Damien wasn't originlaly on this ship."

03:29 You say, "Originally."

03:29 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I know."

03:29 FCI Scout Damien Goss says, "They took off."

03:29 Nissi Valdaire uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:29 You peer out...

03:29 
[Fwoof-Foom Homeworld; Landing Area]
This is a large, flat area, a surface of what appears to be concrete, A dark green mold seems to have worked its way into every pore of it. Large building- or starship-sized mounds are also present on the large concrete slab, themselves covered in what appears to be a thick mat of dark green organic material. The air seems thick and soupy, and is tinged with a strange orange haze. Surrounding the concrete slab are tall tree-like organisms, thick-stalked and topped with umbrella-like structures the color of pale bloodless flesh. Smaller plantoid or fungoid life seems to thrive in the shadows of these larger organisms, even growing on the stalks. A rough-hewn path in the forest leads in the local equivalent of north.
The war galleon "Blackwing Yalobusha" is landed here.
You can go north.

03:29 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

03:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:30 Ali Candan presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:30 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:30 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:30 Fwoof-Foom Homeworld Orbit (Fwoof-Foom) (Security: Delta-10)

03:30 Coordinate rundown:
Starships: Zro Des Cartes (EAOS) at (11, 9, 9) and Blackwing Yalobusha (League) at (11, 13, 13)
Planets: (11, 9, 13)


03:30 Melinda Michaels removes the components of her spacesuit and places them neatly into a dark red flightbag with a gold star and hammer & sickle design.

03:30 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Wow how kind and..."

03:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:30 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:30 FCI Scout Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:30 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:30 Wendy Arroyo glances around at her surroundings.

03:30 Wendy Arroyo strides up.

03:30 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:30 Via general sector communication, Zro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Jim says set course fo rhome."

03:30 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Okay so...that...do we just head home?"

03:30 Wendy Arroyo strides in from above.

03:30 Morris Corlew presses some buttons on the communication board.

03:30 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "link up?"

03:30 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I am so lost now."

03:30 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:31 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:31 Via general sector communication, Zro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Do we have calculations for home vector?"

03:31 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:31 Keegan Wantz presses some buttons on the communication board.

03:31 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "No, Ian's not up here"

03:31 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Ian, you awake?"

03:31 Nissi Valdaire quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

03:31 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 22.5, -12.5.

03:31 Wendy Arroyo says, "Leaving might not be such a good idea just yet."

03:31 Morris Corlew asks, "Are we linkin up?"

03:31 Via general sector communication, Zro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Set course for reverse of initial heading that I forgot what it is."

03:31 Via general sector communication, Zro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Everybody have everybody aboard?"

03:31 Via general sector communication, Zro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Moving in."

03:31 Melinda Michaels says, "Jim is team leader though."

03:31 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:31 Nissi Valdaire presses some buttons on the communication board.

03:31 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "we got one of yours"

03:31 "Right, what does HE say?" Wendy Arroyo nods.

03:31 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

03:31 Keegan Wantz says, "Set course for home, yeah."

03:31 Morris Corlew says, "He says head home."
Melinda Michaels says, "He said set a course for home."

03:32 Ali Candan says, "To set course to home."

03:32 Via general sector communication, Zro Des Cartes transmits a text-based transmission: "Will send somenone to set link, then we dock for crew transfer as needed."

03:32 FCI Scout Damien Goss asks, "Someone explain to me how to attach the link real fast and I'll do that on my way back over there?"

03:32 Ali Candan says, "Let Goss link us up then just go to the other ship."

03:32 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:32 Morris Corlew says, "They're doin it."

03:32 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:32 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Well just go out and walk over there?"

03:32 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:33 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:33 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Wow."

03:33 Keegan Wantz says, "They'll get it linked and dock shortly."

03:33 FCI Scout Damien Goss says, "Not without an approval from someone in charge."

03:33 Melinda Michaels says, "That was scary."

03:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:33 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Good idea."

03:33 Keegan says to Melinda, "I."

03:33 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I am creeped the hell out..."

03:33 Ali Candan says, "The Outsider part the most."

03:33 Keegan Wantz says, "Really hope Georgie is okayu."

03:33 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."

03:33 FCI Scout Damien Goss says, "I'm apparently not as paranoid as I thought I was."

03:33 Keegan Wantz says, "If I shot sooner."

03:33 Wendy Arroyo says, "Bullshit that we're leaving though."

03:33 Keegan Wantz says, "He might not have been able to pull his helmet off."

03:33 The computer announces, "Rift link formed with Zro Des Cartes."

03:33 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:33 Morris Corlew glances at Wendy Arroyo.

03:34 Damien says to Melinda, "So do I return to the other ship?"

03:34 Keegan Wantz says, "They'll dock."

03:34 Melinda says to Damien, "They'll dock for you."

03:34 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:34 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I will never look at orange fungal matrix the same way."

03:34 Keegan Wantz says, "Getting the other person back onboard."

03:34 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:34 The voice of FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "So gross."

03:34 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:34 "Could gather much more information." Wendy Arroyo looks at Morris Corlew and shrugs. "But, on a hypothetical and strictly more practical point of view, if anything happens to that guy, we sure won't be able to fix it on a home vector."

03:35 Keegan Wantz says, "Might be able to get him home in time to not die, at least."

03:35 Keegan Wantz says, "That's probably the best call."

03:35 Melinda Michaels says, "Gotta do what Jim says."

03:35 Keegan Wantz nods.

03:35 Morris Corlew nods to Keegan Wantz and nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:35 I don't understand that.

03:35 You nod.

03:35 Keegan Wantz says, "We have a good bit of medical supplies, but I don't think anyone was expecting -that- kind of ecosystem."

03:35 Melinda Michaels says, "The practical point is to try saving this guy."

03:35 Keegan Wantz nods.

03:35 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:36 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Good to dock?"

03:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't know. It seemed pretty stuck on removing our coverings and pleasure being assured. I can't help but feel there was an ulterior motive there."

03:36 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:36 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Sorry."

03:36 Wendy looks herself over.

03:36 Morris Corlew says, "Probably...and...that'd make sense why the Outsiders are avoidin the area."

03:36 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I know that's pretty warped as it was as it might have had other motives... true that."

03:36 You nod.

03:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Thing is would the outsiders really...wanna stay here if this is one of the few species that can fend them off. I mean that...was a fucking outsider and it was...you know. mind fucked."

03:37 Keegan Wantz says, "Best I can posit is that it wanted to use us like it uses the other creatures on the planet."

03:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "I don't think I want woofie babies... oh wait I can't have babies anyway."

03:37 Wendy Arroyo says, "So hey, I just had a funny thought."

03:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:37 Morris Corlew says, "I mean...the Overlord is bein controlled by...whatever it or they are."

03:37 You chuckle at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, mind control."

03:37 Wendy Arroyo asks, "Did we destroy a blockade station, or a quarantine one?"

03:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah..."

03:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Gosh who knows."

03:37 Nissi Valdaire says, "That just crossed my mind too."

03:37 Melinda Michaels says, "There was nothing living in there."

03:37 FCI Scout Damien Goss nods to Wendy Arroyo. "I was just thinking that."

03:37 You nod.

03:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Wow."

03:37 FCI Scout Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:37 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

03:37 Keegan Wantz says, "They aren't docking."

03:37 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "So were we fighting this thing then?"

03:37 Melinda Michaels says, "Well if it was a quarantine station for the outsiders, too bad."

03:37 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:37 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yo, you guys alright?"

03:38 Morris Corlew says, "Well...if it was a quarantine station...more Outsiders come...and get mind controlled...maybe that's a good thing."

03:38 Keegan Wantz says, "Uhhh."

03:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah so why are we just hanging in here?"

03:38 The voice of Ather Jammoa comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Fine, standing by for home heading."

03:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Dock anyway."

03:38 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes. We are okay so far."

03:38 Keegan Wantz presses some buttons on the navigation board.

03:38 You say, "YEah, I wonder why they're not docking."

03:38 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh, too close to the planet."

03:38 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:38 The voice of FCI Scout Damien Alexander comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Anybody changing ships?"

03:38 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:38 Wendy Arroyo says, "A door goes two ways, you know."

03:38 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:38 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yes. We need to send Goss over."

03:38 Wendy Arroyo says, "Sure, the Outsiders can go in all they like, and those things can come out."

03:38 Kani Kahakai sighs.

03:38 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Is anyone? Need to move a bit away from planet to dock, I think."

03:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "And it can hit you on the ass either way."

03:38 FCI Scout Damien Goss asks, "So I'm in for a spacewalk?"

03:38 FCI Scout Lily Kaise laughs.

03:38 You chuckle at FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:39 Melinda Michaels says, "We're docking."

03:39 Morris Corlew asks, "But if they have no advanced technology...how do they come out?"

03:39 Melinda Michaels says, "When they move."

03:39 Morris Corlew says, "The rift link'll break."

03:39 Keegan Wantz says, "It might have been a case of uh."
Melinda Michaels says, "Ugh the link."

03:39 Keegan Wantz says, "Outsiders finding the planet."

03:39 Kani Kahakai says, "Seems like it doesn't have much interest in leaving its nice cozy planet."

03:39 Wendy Arroyo says, "That's what we saw over twenty, very frantic minutes."

03:39 Morris Corlew nods to Kani Kahakai.

03:39 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Moving to 14 14 14."

03:39 You nod.

03:39 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:39 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "It'll break the link."
Keegan Wantz says, "Anyway."

03:39 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" is in range of firing on or docking with this ship.

03:39 Keegan Wantz says, "Gonna clear out of the control room."

03:39 Nissi Valdaire presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
Nissi Valdaire deftly enters a set of coordinates, and the computer chirps in confirmation.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: (14, 14, 15).

03:39 The stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" has broken the rift link.

03:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:39 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Sad though I so would liked to have learned more but not worth the risks."

03:39 You nod to FCI Scout Lily Kaise. "Me too."

03:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:40 Wendy Arroyo takes off a pair of aviator sunglasses with mirrored gray lenses.

03:40 Wendy Arroyo puts a pair of aviator sunglasses with mirrored gray lenses in a scorched metal thigh holster.

03:40 Melinda Michaels says, "I would have too but, he's the team leader and that guy is injured."

03:40 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods to Melinda Michaels.

03:40 Kani Kahakai says, "Yeah, the biology of the thing seems really fascinating."

03:40 Wendy Arroyo asks, "What's his condition?"

03:40 Morris Corlew nods to Kani Kahakai.

03:40 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:40 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Did georgy get treated in time..."

03:40 Keegan Wantz removes a violet surplus-design stun cannon from a battered metal chest holster.

03:40 Keegan Wantz quickly examines the power level and setting of a violet surplus-design stun cannon.

03:40 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "That's the thing."

03:40 Morris Corlew says, "We don't know."

03:40 Keegan Wantz says, "I shot him shortly after he removed his helmet."

03:40 Keegan Wantz says, "I'm HOPING."

03:40 Keegan Wantz says, "That he didn't breathe much."

03:40 Keegan Wantz says, "Because of that."

03:40 Keegan Wantz says, "But I don't know."

03:41 Keegan Wantz shivers.

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise asks, "So I missed something. What is that inflatable dome thing in the docking bay? Is it some extra life support?"

03:41 Keegan Wantz says, "Going down to observation."

03:41 Morris Corlew nods to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:41 Wendy Arroyo says, "We all know sudden electrical shocks immediately stop someone from breathing, and definitely not the opposite as the body seizes."

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Ohok."

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:41 Nissi Valdaire presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:41 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:41 Keegan says to Wendy, "Depends."

03:41 Morris says to Wendy, "He did the best he could think to do. Kept the guy from runnin into that sphere anyways."

03:41 Keegan Wantz says, "I usually end up exhaling because my chest compresses."

03:41 Keegan Wantz shrugs.

03:41 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:41 Keegan Wantz says, "Either way."

03:41 Keegan Wantz strides south.

03:42 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

03:42 Kani Kahakai says, "Yeah, not sure the head whatsit is airborne anyway."

03:42 Morris Corlew says, "Those spores."

03:42 Morris Corlew says, "So maybe."

03:42 Melinda Michaels says, "If the way to beat the outsiders is letting the Fwoof control us like drones, nope there has got to be another try."

03:42 Kani Kahakai says, "Yeah..."

03:42 The computer announces, "Rift link formed with Zro Des Cartes."

03:42 Keegan Wantz shivers.

03:42 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:42 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Yeah good point."

03:42 Nissi Valdaire says, "All I know is tonight will join the list of events that have traumatized me."

03:42 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" has begun docking procedures with this ship.

03:42 Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.

03:43 Nissi Valdaire says, "The surprise Outsider was enough for that really."

03:43 You nod.
Morris Corlew waves to FCI Scout Damien Goss.

03:43 FCI Scout Damien Goss says, "See you all at home."

03:43 You hear a loud clang, followed by a distinct thud: the sound of a ship docking.

03:43 The stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" is now docked to this ship.

03:43 FCI Scout Damien Goss places a basic white spacesuit helmet atop his head.

03:43 You wave to FCI Scout Damien Goss.

03:43 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves.

03:43 Kani Kahakai says, "I wonder if there are more discerning and socialble Fwoof-Foom that don't just want to subsume any old organism."

03:43 Keegan Wantz says, "Nothing quite like being cooked alive, though."

03:43 FCI Scout Damien Goss steps out.

03:43 Melinda Michaels leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:43 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Is everyone okay over there?"

03:43 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:43 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Far as we know."

03:43 Kani Kahakai says, "Seems like it's a -really fun- process for them."

03:43 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Conditions are stable, if nothing else."

03:43 The voice of FCI Scout Damien Alexander comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "As okay as it makes sense fer us ta make."

03:43 The voice of FCI Scout Damien Alexander comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Be. Something like that."

03:44 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is unlocked.

03:44 You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:44 Jim Gruffudd just entered the ship.

03:44 The voice of FCI Scout Damien Alexander comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I think I need a nap."

03:44 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves to Jim Gruffudd.

03:44 Morris says to Jim Gruffudd, "Is Georgie alright?"

03:44 You wave to Jim Gruffudd.

03:44 Kani peeks concernedly at Jim Gruffudd.

03:44 "Is that guy all right?" Melinda Michaels glances at Jim Gruffudd.

03:44 Keegan says to Jim Gruffudd, "I didn't shoot him fast enough. I'm sorry."

03:44 Keegan Wantz winces.

03:44 Jim Gruffudd says, "So far... but..."

03:44 Jim Gruffudd shrugs.

03:44 Keegan glancing at a violet surplus-design stun cannon, slowly sets it back in its holster.

03:44 Keegan Wantz puts a violet surplus-design stun cannon in a battered metal chest holster.

03:44 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:44 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn asks, "That's...that's your son?"

03:45 Jim Gruffudd says, "We did what we came here to do. I... I want to get him home."

03:45 FCI Scout Lily Kaise nods.

03:45 Morris Corlew nods to Jim Gruffudd.

03:45 Keegan Wantz nods.

03:45 Hawthorn gives a somber look over the man before averting his eyes from Jim.

03:45 Morris Corlew asks, "Are we takin lead, or are they gonna lead us home?"

03:45 You nod.

03:45 Keegan Wantz says, "Minimal stops on the way home as well, then? Probably best to get him to a bigger medical suite."

03:46 Wendy looks out the one viewport and shakes her head slowly, hands braced against her hips.

03:46 Melinda Michaels says, "I would imagine we need to get him home quick."

03:46 Melinda says to Wendy, "What?"

03:46 Jim Gruffudd says, "We'll see what his condition is. Maybe... it's not what it looked like."

03:46 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Are we staying suited until we get home?"

03:46 Kani says to Wendy, "Hair of the dog isn't always the right medicine."

03:47 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:47 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "You were decontaminated. We've unsuited. Hard to use the...facilities in your suit."

03:47 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

03:47 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I know I love my showers."

03:47 Keegan Wantz asks, "Well, shall we get out of the way so we can start flying?"

03:47 Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

03:47 The voice of Cheri Lindbergh comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Also hard to drink lager."

03:47 Keegan Wantz strides south.

03:47 Morris Corlew presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:47 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Yeah. I gotta rest anyway."

03:47 Hawthorn says to Jim, "You need to talk or anything...let me know, okay?"

03:47 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "And I so need fucking lager right now. I wanna drink my way up and down Mel's booze machine 10 times over."

03:48 Hawthorn says to Jim, "I'll try and be a good listener..."

03:48 Morris Corlew takes Gonzales Bourne into his group.

03:48 Morris Corlew's group shuffles south.

03:48 Jim Gruffudd says, "Sure."

03:48 Melinda glances around and shakes her head, "wow. That sphere, uh, it wanted to control us or am I crazy."

03:48 Hawthorn nods once. "Alright just... let me know."

03:49 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll be down in the habitation deck."

03:49 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:49 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "22.5 -12.5 if you guys are planning on leading."

03:49 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Do you want us to?"

03:50 Melinda Michaels asks, "They gonna be alert for patrols?"

03:50 Wendy Arroyo says, "Definitely not. I never seen 'em awake in the morning."

03:50 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "Probably not..."

03:50 Melinda Michaels says, "They, uh kinda were the least alert ship."

03:50 Wendy Arroyo says, "If we must, we should lead."

03:50 Nissi Valdaire leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:50 The voice of Nissi Valdaire comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "There is some concern about morning alertness levels over there."

03:50 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You lead again."

03:50 The voice of Katina Faye comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "You guys lead."

03:51 Nissi Valdaire accidentally slams her shoulder into Jim Gruffudd as she attempts to work with the rift drive controls.

03:51 Blackwing Yalobusha has claimed leadership of the rift group.
Melinda Michaels chuckles.

03:51 Kani Kahakai grins.

03:51 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sorry."

03:51 FCI Scout Lily Kaise
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder, and a pair of sturdy bright red walking boots. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, and a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer. Her face, both eyes,
03:51  both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

03:51 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll get out of the way..."

03:51 FCI Scout Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

03:51 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We shall cover the rear."

03:51 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "One 18 hour day was enough for me. Yes, that time is extremely difficult, and I'd like not to do it too often unless it's a case of emergency."

03:51 Nissi Valdaire accidentally slams her shoulder into Kani Kahakai as she attempts to work with the rift drive controls.

03:51 Nissi Valdaire flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:51 FCI Scout Lily Kaise holds your hand, taking you into her group.

03:51 FCI Scout Lily Kaise waves.

03:51 The ship has undocked from the stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes".

03:51 The computer reports that the stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" has entered the riftflow.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:51 Kani Kahakai says, "Nnf..."

03:51 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

03:52 You follow FCI Scout Lily Kaise south.

03:52 The voice of Jim Gruffudd comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey. No one feel bad, all right? We came here to find out what was out here. We've done that. Now we know what we're dealing with. If... when we come back, we'll have a plan. One suited to situation."

03:52 I don't understand that.

03:52 You cuddle up to FCI Scout Lily Kaise.

03:52 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:52 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Amen to that."

03:52 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Come back?"

03:52 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Wow nobody here."

03:52 Keegan Wantz scrambles to his feet.

03:52 Keegan Wantz strides south.

03:53 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We need to find out more about their relationship with the outsiders I feel."

03:53 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:53 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Seems to me the Outsiders got a bit more'n they bargained for. Picked on the wrong species."

03:53 I don't see that here.

03:53 You squeeze FCI Scout Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:53 The voice of FCI Scout Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "We, or someone has to come back again. We need to investigate more into these...beings. Their relationship with the outsiders, for one thing."

03:53 FCI Scout Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

03:54 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Agree with Eve."

03:54 FCI Scout Lily Kaise opens a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:54 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:54 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Not sure that there's a relationship with any more'n the one Outsider...but seein that thing like that...just wow."

03:54 FCI Scout Lily Kaise puts an elegant crystal decanter on a mahogany coffee table.

03:54 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Relations seems limited to mind controlling that one that got near."

03:54 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

03:54 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Eah Pierre has a point there."

03:54 The voice of Cheri Lindbergh comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Did anybody film it?"

03:54 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:54 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "That's an image I won't soon forget."

03:54 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "The relationship is pretty clear. That sphere kicked outsider behind by controlling, somehow."

03:55 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:55 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Jim has his holorecordin."

03:55 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:55 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Guessing Outsiders just blockaded the place with automated things and never came back. We did not meet many patrols."

03:56 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:56 You say over the linked rift comm, "Yeah, I'm surprised we didn'tmeet more patrols."

03:56 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:56 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:56 A designated mission staging point appears to be 3.26 light-grand cycles away toward Galactic Northeast and Very Slightly Down.

03:56 Keegan Wantz says, "Ah, the staging point."

03:56 The voice of Ted Warburton comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "I guess they will be surprised to find we're on our way back when they do."

03:56 FCI Scout Lily Kaise says, "Bye Staging point."

03:57 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:57 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "I'm curious if it never really left the planet, and the Outsiders just detected life there."

03:57 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:57 The voice of Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Probably, industrial prowess seems very limited."

03:58 The voice of Aisling the Fox comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "It did not have proper word for starship."

03:58 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:58 You say over the linked rift comm, "Yeah, it called them containers from the sky."

03:58 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:58 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Huh."

03:58 You lean into a microphone near the rift controls.

03:58 You say over the linked rift comm, "Or more accurately sky containers."

03:59 FCI Scout Lily Kaise exclaims, "When there is no sky!"

03:59 The voice of Ather Jammoa comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Yeah, they have no space-based technology, that seems fairly evident."

04:01 You say, "Me too."

04:04 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "They technically might have the Magistrate?"

04:04 Morris Corlew leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:04 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Probably. That Outsider had to get down there somehow."

04:04 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:04 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "We didn't see it, and the Outsiders lost contact with it."

04:04 The voice of Blockade Smasher Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Would be a long tow job."

04:04 The voice of Ather Jammoa comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Honestly they were probably working on a piece of it for all we know."

04:13 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Well I don't like not being able to totally fix someone else's ship."

04:13 Morris Corlew shuffles south.

04:14 You nod to Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise. "I understand, but the most important thing is that the enemy ships went pop and ours did not."

04:15 You wrap your arms around Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:30 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "In retrospect, we don't know how whatever got into him would react to being frozen, so maybe not ideal anyway."

04:30 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Aye, here's hoping."

04:31 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

04:31 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You will enjoy it!"

04:32 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Oh, Wiggly isn't in the movies bin."

04:32 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

04:32 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I think I have one."

04:32 I don't understand that.

04:32 Keegan Wantz removes a 50-panel film disc titled "The Siren (R)" from a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!'.

04:32 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the south.

04:32 Keegan Wantz removes a 100-panel film disc titled "~*~ Love and Kisses ~*~ (G)" from a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!'.

04:32 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I have it and I think the first episode of Steellar."

04:32 Morris Corlew puts a silver holodisc titled "Wiggly the Cat" in a silver projector.

04:32 Morris Corlew pats a silver projector lightly.

04:32 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ahem. Stellar."

04:32 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "I haven't seen that one either, if you care to watch it."

04:32 Morris Corlew closes a silver projector.

04:32 Keegan Wantz sits down on a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

04:32 Keegan Wantz says, "Well, let's see.."

04:32 Morris Corlew sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.

04:32 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There's two episodes out right now let me check."

04:32 Morris Corlew waves.

04:33 [From the projector] A cheerful tune begins playing. The words "Wiggly the Cat" appear, written in cursive and formed from a long orange tail. A moment later the words "A Film by Annissia Sienna Valdaire and Gwendolyn Arroyo" appear underneath.

04:33 Morris Corlew shuffles south.

04:33 [From the projector] As the happy music plays, the first scene appears: a preteen redhaired girl fumbling with the ribbons on a gift box, then pulling them loose. The top of the box pops off and a small orange kitten pokes his head out. The kitten meows piteously and the girl squeals happily. She picks up the wriggling kitten and hugs him to her chest.

04:33 [From the projector] The scene fades to a closer shot of the orange cat looking just a little bit older and less awkward. He's wearing a collar now with a tag that has "Wiggly" stamped into it.

04:33 [From the projector] The shot pulls wide to show that Wiggly is trotting down a corridor, following behind his redheaded owner. The scene appears to be on a space station. There are metal bulkheads and deck plating, and viewports that show mostly blackness outside, though other stations seem to be floating nearby, making this station part of a cluster.

04:33 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn removes a silver holodisc from a black canvas Fringe gear bag.

04:34 [From the projector] The girl turns back to Wiggly with a smile and makes a "hurry up" gesture. Wiggly breaks into a run to keep up and the girl giggles.

04:34 [From the projector] The music turns ominous as the scene changes to focus on a viewport in one of the station corridors. As the camera very slowly zooms in, you see the flash of a wormhole opening and an Outsider warship appears. Inside the station, the lighting turns red and klaxons begin sounding.

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn puts a silver holodisc in a black canvas Fringe gear bag.

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn removes a silver holodisc titled "Sleeper" from a black canvas Fringe gear bag.

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn puts a silver holodisc in a black canvas Fringe gear bag.

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn removes a silver holodisc titled "Sleeper" from a black canvas Fringe gear bag.

04:34 [From the projector] The scene changes to a crowded corridor. People are running, panicking, some even pushing others out of the way. Everyone is heading for the docking bay and a group of shuttles waiting inside.

04:34 [From the projector] The redhaired girl is ahead, the camera moving to catch up with her as she reaches the hatchway to the docking bay. She turns and looks down, her face frightened, and the camera pans down to show Wiggly, dodging running feet as he frantically tries to get to his owner.

04:34 Keegan Wantz says, "Uh."

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn puts a silver holodisc titled "Sleeper" in a black canvas Fringe gear bag.
Keegan Wantz says, "UH."

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn removes a shiny holodisc titled "STELLAR: The Miscellaneous heist" from a black canvas Fringe gear bag.

04:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn gives a shiny holodisc titled "STELLAR: The Miscellaneous heist" to Keegan Wantz.

04:35 [From the projector] The girl starts after him, but an older man grabs her by the arm, pulling her forcefully toward the shuttles. The camera is with Wiggly now, the view frequently blocked by legs and feet as the girl struggles to go after him. Wiggly is knocked over, sprawling against a bulkhead.

04:35 Keegan Wantz says, "Wiggly noooooooo."

04:35 [From the projector] When the cat gets back to his feet, the corridor is starting to clear out. Shuttles are lifting off one by one. His owner is nowhere to be seen.

04:35 [From the projector] Outside the station, shuttles are fleeing, opening wormholes and vanishing one by one. Soon they're all gone.

04:35 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, god I can't watch this again."

04:35 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

04:35 [From the projector] An Outsider warship moves in close to the station and lingers there for a moment. A flat beam shoots out of it and roams over the station, clearly representing some kind of scan. When the scan completes, the warship floats there for another long moment, then silently moves on. The music fades.

04:35 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn says, "Not a date film."

04:35 Keegan Wantz says, "No human life."

04:35 [From the projector] Back inside the station, everything seems calm again, the lighting back to plain white. Wiggly pads through empty corridors, meowing every so often. He seems to be the only living thing aboard.

04:35 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

04:35 Keegan Wantz says, "Okay."

04:36 Keegan Wantz says, "But."

04:36 [From the projector] Wiggly comes to a closed hatch. He sits down in front of it and stares up for a moment, then he jumps up and slaps at the door control with his paw. The hatch slides open, revealing living quarters.

04:36 Keegan Wantz says, "No more humans..."

04:36 [From the projector] The cat walks inside and sniffs at a bowl with his name on it. It's empty. He pads into another room, a little girl's bedroom. On the bed is a fuzzy green sweater. Wiggly jumps up onto it, curls up, and heaves a sigh before closing his eyes. The scene fades to black.

04:36 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Whoever said this was a date movie."

04:36 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "You are a fucking monster."

04:36 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thank you!"

04:36 [From the projector] Wiggly is padding through a corridor again. He stops and stares up at a hatch. It's labeled "Emergency Ration Storage." With a leap and a smack of his paw, the hatch is toggled open.

04:36 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I've been saying this."

04:36 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yeah I hate films that make me cry..."

04:36 [From the projector] The cat jumps up and knocks one of many plain white boxes to the deck. He follows it down and starts ripping it open with his claws. When he's made a big enough hole, he sticks his head in and begins eating.

04:36 Lily sobs.

04:37 [From the projector] The scene fades out for a long moment, and when the station appears again, there is a layer of dust over everything. Some of the lights are flickering. Wiggly looks older, nothing of a kitten left about him. He's padding through a corridor, his head down.

04:37 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "You just can't do this to a cat lover! Noooooo!"

04:37 [From the projector] Suddenly, something catches his eye. He jumps up to a viewport, his claws scrabbling for a moment before he holds himself in place. He stares, his whiskers twitching.

04:37 You squeeze Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:37 [From the projector] Across space, at a different station, at a different viewport, is the distant figure of a cat. Wiggly lifts one paw to the viewport. As he sees that the other cat is doing the same, he lets out a small meow.

04:37 [From the projector] The film becomes a montage as sad, slow music plays. Short scenes play: Wiggly wandering through empty corridors. Wiggly at the viewport, looking out at the other lonely cat in the other station. Wiggly eating from the rations. Over time, the station grows dimmer, more and more of its lights fading. The pile of ripped open ration boxes grows bigger and bigger. And Wiggly seems to spend more and more time staring out the viewport at his companion.

04:37 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Aww it's just a mirror immage."

04:38 [From the projector] A scene inside the ration storage room lingers. Wiggly is nosing around in the ripped open boxes. The camera pans up, showing that the shelves are bare. Wiggly meows and wanders slowly out of the room.

04:38 [From the projector] The camera follows Wiggly through dusty, dim corridors of flickering light. The water recycling system has even sprung a leak, leaving water to run down one of the walls.

04:38 [From the projector] Wiggly comes to his favorite viewport and jumps up to take a look. His companion is there, just a fuzzy outline from this distance. Wiggly lifts a paw and plants it against the viewport, and so does his friend. Wiggly's whiskers droop slowly and he jumps down.

04:38 [From the projector] The small cat sits on the deck, slumped over. He stays still as the camera zooms in on him slowly.

04:38 [From the projector] After some long moments, Wiggly's ears twitch. His whiskers lift. He looks up sharply, suddenly determined. He trots off down the corridor, picking up speed as he goes.

04:39 [From the projector] Wiggly stops in front of a thick hatch. He sits, swishes his tail back and forth, then jumps up and smacks the door control. As the hatch slides open and Wiggly pads in, the camera pans up to show the label above it: "AIRLOCK. STAND CLEAR."

04:39 Gonzales Bourne waves.

04:39 [From the projector] Through the airlock's viewport, you see the neighboring station where his companion lives, not so far away. Wiggly looks at it for a moment, then turns back to the door controls. He jumps up and seals the hatch into the station, then sits back down, still looking up, his tail swishing again.

04:39 You wave to Gonzales Bourne.

04:39 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise waves to Gonzales Bourne.

04:39 [From the projector] The camera shows a big red button with a cover over it, and Wiggly sitting on the deck below, looking up. He jumps, his paw batting at the cover, but he fails to move it. He tries again and fails again. Finally, the third time, he manages to dislodge the cover and expose the button.

04:39 [From the projector] Wiggly heaves a breath. He jumps one more time, his paw slapping onto the big red button. The airlock's lighting turns red and a klaxon sounds. Just a moment later, the external hatch slides open. The airlock's atmosphere is blown out into space, carrying the small orange cat with it. The music stops and the film goes completely silent.

04:40 Gonzales Bourne asks, "What happenned since blockading?"

04:40 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Smart kittycat but he's going to starve to death and I can't deal."

04:40 [From the projector] Wiggly twists himself around as he's propelled through space, turning to face the neighboring station. The familiar viewport he's spent so much time looking at is just a little off to the side, and he wiggles that way, trying to steer himself toward it, but it doesn't have much effect.

04:40 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise sighs.

04:40 [From the projector] As he gets closer to the station, Wiggly's companion appears in the viewport, clearly seen for the first time. It's another little orange cat, just like Wiggly! The other cat's eyes widen in surprise.

04:40 [From the projector] The other cat's whiskers are beginning to glimmer with frost.

04:40 [From the projector] The cat raises its paw, and the camera swings around to show Wiggly making the same motion at the same moment.

04:41 Gonzales Bourne scrambles to his feet.

04:41 Gonzales Bourne sprints south.

04:41 [From the projector] The camera pans over the top of the station... revealing a large hole in the middle of it, gutted by Outsider weaponry. This station has clearly been dead since the attack, unpowered and pitch black inside.

04:41 [From the projector] Wiggly's struggles stop as he realizes he's only trying to reach his own reflection. He goes limp as he gives up, and his eyes close as he tumbles slowly in the harsh vacuum of space.

04:41 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise cries.

04:41 [From the projector] The scene fades slowly to total blackness.

04:41 [From the projector] A single sad note plays, held for long moments.

04:41 [From the projector] The view remains black as the note fades out.

04:41 [From the projector] Suddenly, there is a flash of white.

04:41 [From the projector] The flash fades and the scene is centered on Wiggly. Some force has caught him, pulling him away from the station he was drifting towards. He jerks once.

04:41 [From the projector] The scene cuts to show a starship control board, focusing on its monochrome screen. The screen prints the text "Debris recovered."

04:42 [From the projector] "Scanning..."

04:42 [From the projector] "Life form."

04:42 [From the projector] A figure wearing a gray shipsuit leaps up from the pilot's seat and swings through a hatch into the storage room. On the deck is an orange cat, looking very small and still.

04:42 [From the projector] The pilot drops to her knees, scoops up the little cat, and hugs him to her chest as long red hair falls over her shoulders.

04:42 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

04:42 Keegan Wantz shivers.

04:42 [From the projector] The woman lets out a sob. A long moment passes. Then Wiggly squirms weakly, meows piteously, and buries his head in the crook of the woman's arm. She hugs him tighter.

04:42 Lily still cries.

04:42 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

04:42 You say, "Awww."

04:42 [From the projector] THE END.

04:42 The images above the holographic projector cease as the disc ends.

04:42 You wrap your arms around Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:43 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "I."

04:43 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Goddamnit."

04:43 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Heh."

04:43 Kani Kahakai's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Did you spring a leak?"

04:43 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sad stuff."

04:44 Keegan Wantz opens a silver projector.

04:44 Keegan Wantz removes a silver holodisc titled "Wiggly the Cat" from a silver projector.

04:44 Keegan Wantz scrambles to his feet.

04:44 Keegan Wantz strides south.

04:44 Keegan Wantz strides in from the south.

04:44 Keegan Wantz puts a shiny holodisc titled "STELLAR: The Miscellaneous heist" in a silver projector.

04:44 Keegan Wantz closes a silver projector.

04:44 Keegan Wantz sets a silver projector upright and turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.

04:45 [From the projector] the view opens up with a stylized picture of the solar system. the sun is located in the middle of the screen while all the planets out to Pluto are bright dots of light of varying colors. A picture of a petite oriental woman with fine angular cheekbones and almond shaped eyes appears and slides to the upper left corner. Tai Chan Sing is captioned under the photo.

04:45 [From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen. Some of the most notable are one of Tai holding a datapad and switching her view from it to the landscape while pointing out landmarks and giving instructions to the rest of her team. As she points at Sephronia and finds her gone she begins to pull at her hair in frustration. Another is of Tai folding down into the lotus position inside a Victorian decorated room while two of her teammates watch over her and the street below. The last is of Tai holding an oversized rifle and screaming as a burst of plasma is ejected into a crowd of enemy ninja bots.

04:45 You squeeze Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:46 [From the projector] Coming back to the view of the solar system the camera has moved closer and shifted so that the third bright light from the sun is beginning to become the center focus. Another picture flashes onto the screen of a mid-twenties white male with fashionably mussed hair and perfect features. Captioned at the bottom of the picture is the name William "Billboard" Stanton. The picture moves up to the lower  right corner of the view.

04:46 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:46 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise leans on you.

04:46 [From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen. Some of the most notable are one of William sitting in a well lit chair with a woman dusting his face while RHC512 floats around. A second one of William trying to evade reality show fanatics while tossing out bags of Chippy chips over his shoulder and screaming  "They are all autographed." Lastly, one of William, in his powered armor, and a bat winged figure floating in space pushing an enormous rock closer to a softly glowing distortion.

04:46 You wrap your arms around Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:46 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise laughs.

04:46 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise exclaims, "Damn I needed this!"

04:46 [From the projector] Returning yet again to the view of the system, the camera is noticeably closer to Earth. A third picture joins the scene. This one is an average looking woman of no distinct racial features. Her bright green eyes and mischievous grin are quite notable though. As the picture slides into the upper right corner it is captioned with the name Sephronia Elizabeth Camilla Miles-English.

04:47 [From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen. Some of the most notable are one of Sephronia leaning  over a workbench while working on some oddly designed device. A second one of the team standing beside and behind Sephronia with their hands on her shoulders while a hazy image superimposes over reality showing a man being assaulted. Finally, one of Sephronia facing off against twelve men in black body armor and performing insane feats of martial arts leaving several of them laid out on the dusty ground.

04:47 The voice of Melinda Michaels comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Scary theory over here."

04:47 [From the projector] The camera is getting close enough to Earth at this point to begin to make out continental features and cloud formations. A new picture appears. this one is a stocky woman of middle years with messy hair to her shoulders and a medium sized pin on her lapel reading Recycle or else! Captioned below the picture as it slides to the bottom left corner is the name Addy Sue Stevens.

04:48 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.
The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hm?"

04:48 [From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen. Some of the most notable are one of Addy looking up from under the hood of some machine and wiping her hands only to realize there is a fight all around her and her team yelling at her to help. A second of Addy gesticulating while frantically trying to talk her team into destroying a building. Lastly, one of Addy facing down a large group of enemies and expanding her arms above her head as though opening something, a large rock fall appears directly above the enemy group and tons of rock fall out of the sky.

04:48 [From the projector] The camera is still closing on the planet as features of a megacity in the northeastern portion of North America can be made out. A final picture is placed in the center of the view. A handsome, fine featured male with tanned skin, excellently styled hair and razor straight eyebrows. Just before all the photos fade away this last one is captioned with the name of David Li Wang.

04:48 The voice of Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "What is this frightening theory?"

04:49 [From the projector] In a rapid montage several scenes flash up on the screen. Some of the most notable are one of David standing outside a shop staring at himself in the window adjusting his black suit, while in the reflection a brawl is occurring in the street behind him. Another one is David in workout clothes performing a martial arts routine in front of children in poses of rapt attention. Finally, one of David being attacked by a humanoid robot and thrusting his hand forward which results in the robot being thrown across the room.

04:49 [From the projector] The camera is focusing on one particular building near the coast. As it rotates and circles in we get a view of a side. In a final rush downwards the words "Space and Time Elite Liaisons for the League of Active Reconnaissance" in rapid succession. As the door at street level comes into view STELLAR slams onto the screen as though from a giant, only moderately inked, stamp. Just under and to the right of the stamp is the title, "The Miscellaneous heist."

04:49 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "Ok so...I was thinkin. What if Hwoof-Hoom is the only non-alien? That...the humanoids were at one time visitors like us and the Outsider...that they've...the humanoids...the originals populated with the help of Hwoof-Hoom...and that there could be little Outsiders runnin round there at some point down the road."

04:49 Keegan Wantz says, "This is."

04:50 [From the projector] Tai, Sephronia, Addy, William, and David are sitting around a conference table discussing what they did last weekend.

04:50 The voice of Morris Corlew comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "But controlled by the sphere...by Hwoof-Hoom."

04:50 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise nods to Keegan Wantz.

04:50 [From the projector] A disgruntled red headed middle aged male (McDougal) enters the room and throws down several file folders onto the table.

04:50 Keegan Wantz says, "A pretty generic film, I think."

04:50 [From the projector] McDougal says, "We need you all to get your asses to Mars and figure who has been making off with all this technology." He then proceeds to  point at different pages in his copy of the file folder while everyone else scrambles to get one.

04:50 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

04:50 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise says, "I can't focus on it it's too chaotic for me."

04:50 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise laughs.

04:50 [From the projector] "They stolen parts from Tech Enterprises, Monico Inc, Purple star Memory, and we're not sure if it is connected but Grand Grocery." Pacing back and forth at the head of the table McDougal then says, "Your job, whether you like it or not, is to get out there and find out who's been stealing these things, find out why, and apprehend them. Normally this technology is innocent enough on its own but we have reason to believe, or at least the crackpots in engineering do anyway, that in some combinations this technology could be used for a variety of really  nasty, mind boggling crimes. That probably means they don't have a clue but we can't work on that assumption."

04:50 The voice of Blockade Smasher Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Holy fuck. That's scary, and possible, and...I'm never sleeping again."

04:50 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

04:51 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

04:51 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:51 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise gives you a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:51 [From the projector] The scene switches to the team sitting around the conference table following the pacing of McDougal back and forth. Tai Chan Sing clears her throat and in a surprisingly  melodious voice asks, "Excuse me Director McDougal, have the investigation teams been over the crime scenes?" almost on top of Tai, Sephronia Elizabeth Camilla, Miles-English jumps up and proclaims in what starts to be an authoritative voice, "We'll get to the bottom of this!" Her voice trailing off into an interrogative as she glances around and sees not everyone is as enthusiastic as she is.

04:51 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise examines an elegant crystal decanter for a moment.

04:51 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise helps herself to a large crystal gold-trimmed goblet of Cape Myers Paradise Vineyards Pinot Grigio.

04:51 [From the projector] The team suddenly jumps to their feet in surprise as from off camera McDougal shouts, "Well, what are you waiting for? go! Go! Go!"

04:51 Lily says to you, "Ready?"

04:51 [From the projector] The agents scramble around and over the table in an effort to get away from the perpetually angry director and make their way out of the room and to an equipment room where rows upon rows of weapons, gadgets, and armors are stored.

04:51 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

04:52 [From the projector] A few minutes of pointless banter pass between the agents as they gear up with knives, guns, portable devices and various other gadgetry. Then a technician walks up to Tai and asks, "You are the team leader, right?"

04:52 Blockade Smasher Lily Kaise walks south.

04:52 [From the projector] Tai Chan Sing looks around as if not really wanting to take on the responsibility for the rest of the group but nods resignedly and turns her full attention to the technician asking, "What have they done now?"

04:52 [From the projector] The technician smirks knowingly and thrusts out a clipboard with a paper attached. "I just need you to sign for the new prototype equipment we are sending out with you. You'll also need to stop by the outfitter to pick it up."

04:52 [From the projector] Later the team of agents can be seen walking out of a huge skyscraper with STELLAR in blocky letters above the entrance rubbing the back of their necks and grimacing. the scene soon transitions to them boarding a starship that is jetting small white clouds  from several nozzles arranged around the hull.

04:52 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

04:53 [From the projector] Later inside the starship the camera pans around, catching views of the agents at their various ship duties, finally coming to focus on a window where Mars can be seen getting larger, rapidly.

04:53 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

04:53 [From the projector] William is the first one out of the ship with a wave as though he fully expects his adoring fans to be present and waiting just for him. Tai, David, and Sephronia step out shortly after. there is a pause and then Tai yells back into the ship, "Addy, wake up!" Whereupon Addy comes out wiping drool from her chin, muttering something about alarms.

04:53 [From the projector] Tai looks around and sighs at the team, "Let's go check the crime scenes." William is crestfallen seeing no fans waiting for him on the landing pad. David takes a moment to fix his hair in the reflection of the hull. Sephronia peers about quizzically and says, "I thought Mars was red."

04:53 [From the projector] The team make their way to a large blocky vehicle with tinted windows and landing struts where wheels normally would be positioned, and pile in. taking off in the vehicle they zoom away as the landing struts retract and William rolls down his window as he finally sees the adoring fans he expected as he exited the ship. From a side pocket on his pants he pulls out a thick stack of glossy photos and begins tossing them into the crowd while RHC512 hovers up from the roof and rotates slowly getting a good wide angle view of the exchange.

04:54 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "This one seems really genericly actiony, Hawthorn."

04:54 [From the projector] Following the vehicle from a high perspective the picture shows pedestrians going about their business along a geometrically straight street lined on either side by buildings that tower off the top of the view and extend off into the distance. The scenery is very uniform and boring.

04:54 The voice of Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Hey, is Jim there with you guys?"

04:54 Keegan Wantz leans into a microphone near the rift controls.

04:54 The voice of Keegan Wantz comes clearly over the linked rift comm, saying, "He went to his quarters, we think."

04:54 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't look at me. It was better than the tear jerker on my date."

04:54 [From the projector] As the vehicle pulls up outside yet another tower block building and is received by the opening hatch that leads below street level, the team stop  and step out, letting the vehicle make its own way into a parking space in the garage. Tai looks pointedly at the group and declares, "I'll do all the talking if we have to actually deal with anyone." The group  looks around before nodding and following Tai inside the building's entrance.

04:55 [From the projector] Pulling out a datapad and swiping across it a few times, Tai pulls up a schematic of the building that shows a large red portion. the team of agents make their way down corridors, past doors of various sizes as well as a few alcoves with statuary in them. After taking a lift up a few floors they arrive at a security checkpoint which is covered with a web of yellow and red tape stretched across it reading "Do Not Enter under pain of prosecution"

04:55 [From the projector] Tai, Sephronia, David, Addy, and William spread out across the area carefully going over portions of the room with scanners and delicate tools. From off camera you hear David exclaim, "Boss, someone had a bad hair day over here!" The team of agents continue looking over the place until Tai is satisfied there isn't anything else to be found.

04:55 The voice of Johann Schraft comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "Did you all get any scans off of the humanoids, or other lifeforms? Maybe if they are not indiginous, with the right kinds of scans you might be able to narrow down where to find them."

04:55 [From the projector] As everyone gathers near the door preparing to leave Sephronia taps Tai on the shoulder and says, "Can I take a look back? come on, you know I can, I can do it, I want to do it, please just let me do it, I know you know I can and want me to, awesome I'll do it." At each slight pause Tai opens her mouth to respond but can't quite get a word in edgewise. In the background you can just make out Addy fiddling with some device, it looks like she might be trying to pry the control panel off it.

04:56 [From the projector] Spinning around Sephronia takes a moment to collect herself then begins to concentrate with a glare and the tip of her tongue pokes out the corner of her mouth. In just a few seconds the scene distorts and is replaced with an almost identical scene save the seven foot tall, lean, purple  skinned, monstrosity skulking around the room browsing shelves and occasionally pulling down items. As it turns around one corner of a shelf it brushes against it and  lets out an uncharacteristic squeak while putting a hand to its head. The distortion wavers and the scene is back to an empty room with various identification cones and dust  stains.

04:56 I don't see that here.

04:56 You scramble to your feet.

The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

05:17 a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder

05:17 This is a form-fitting but not overly tight jumpsuit of sturdy material. It is unmistakeably red, but not a deep or bright red, except for darker trim. A white-on-black patch with the letters "FCI" is on one shoulder, with "First Contact Initiative" helpfully spelled out in much smaller letters just underneath.
It covers both your shoulders, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both hips, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, neck, chest, back, abdomen, waist, and groin.

05:40 You say to Lily, "Night."

05:41 Shule runs his hand from your chest to your tummy and down to your abdomen.

05:43 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

05:51 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

05:54 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

05:54 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

06:14 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rest well Morris."

06:14 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Mmhmm. Y'all two when you get there."

06:24 An injured soldier hobbles by using his rifle as a makeshift crutch. His left leg is soaked in blood.

06:34 Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and mangled stump where his right arm once was.

06:34 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo Jim, if you are awake, the other ship has concerns about keeping something from happening to Georgie and wish to voice them with you."

06:44 An allied soldier jumps down into the trench and quickly disappears into the fog.

06:54 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

06:54 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

07:24 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

07:35 Somewhere outside, you hear an argument over esoteric game rules that don't seem to make any sense.

07:44 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

07:55 You hear dice roll. A moment later, a giant hand descends and advances the ship several spaces.

07:55 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

07:55 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

08:12 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

08:25 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

08:27 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

08:37 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

08:38 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

08:47 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

08:54 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

08:57 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

08:57 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

09:00 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

09:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

09:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:06 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

09:30 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

09:36 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

09:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

09:44 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

09:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:54 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

09:57 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

09:58 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

09:59 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

10:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

10:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:47 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

10:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:58 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

11:00 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

11:00 Listen. You need to be careful.

11:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:04 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

11:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:25 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

11:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

11:35 So much pain. For what?

11:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:41 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

11:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:51 No one knows who you really are. The thing you keep buried and hidden behind your fake smiles.

11:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:01 Remember what I said.

12:02 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

12:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:31 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

12:42 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

12:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:52 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

13:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:02 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

13:02 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

13:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:12 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hello."

13:13 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Good morning!"

13:30 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

13:32 A baby wails, its cries muffled by a thick swaddling of blankets.

13:33 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey awake pilots, question of the day is being debated. Would you offer up your felo for experimentations such as the one that Georgie did?"

13:34 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

13:34 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Definite yeah, here, obviously."

13:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:42 The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.

13:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:52 The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.

13:54 The swirling snowflakes thin out a little.

13:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:03 The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.

14:03 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

14:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:15 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'll be up in two hours."

14:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:59 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

15:05 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

15:05 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

15:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:10 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

15:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

15:35 The train suddenly blows its whistle for no apparent reason.

15:38 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

15:39 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

15:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

15:50 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

15:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:00 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

16:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:06 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

16:08 The computer announces, "Weapons systems offline."

16:09 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "A day and a half charge."

16:10 The room grows a bit warmer.

16:44 The room grows a bit warmer.

16:54 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

17:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

17:05 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

17:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

17:08 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from the mist below.

17:28 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

17:38 The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to be in its driver's seat.

17:42 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

17:42 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

17:43 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

17:43 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anybody else?"

17:44 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Steppin out."

17:57 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

17:57 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

17:57 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

17:58 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

17:58 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

18:28 Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face backwards.

18:32 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

18:42 Some people stumble by on the shore, their heads twisted around to face backwards.

18:52 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

18:59 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

18:59 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

19:04 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

19:29 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

19:30 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

19:30 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

19:30 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

19:30 Lily Kaise removes a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and coral rocks from a personal hoverpallet.

19:31 Lily Kaise puts a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and coral rocks on a personal hoverpallet.

19:39 Lily Kaise says, "I'llsure miss my fish."

19:39 Lily Kaise says, "I'll sure miss my fish."

19:45 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

19:55 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

20:00 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

20:00 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

20:03 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

20:17 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

20:22 Lily Kaise walks out.

20:27 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, taking it down sped us up."

20:27 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Horrible people time!"

20:27 Lily Kaise walks in from the west.

20:28 Lily Kaise lies down on a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it.

20:28 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

20:28 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone else want in on this?"

20:29 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

20:29 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes yes I'll be there in 4 minutes."

20:29 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You're...already here."

20:39 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

20:50 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

20:51 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

21:01 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

21:03 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

21:03 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

21:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

22:04 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

22:04 The mist fades as you hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

22:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:34 A bird grows tired and falls behind the V formation. You take its place.

22:40 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

22:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

23:01 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

23:07 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly dissolves into swirling mist.

23:07 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell suddenly emerges from the mist. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

23:11 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yo Jim."

23:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
