00:02 Aisling the Fox leans on Jason an Eachtrannach.

00:03 Evenia Callseah blinks.

00:03 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "You are behind."

00:03 Morris Corlew gives a thumbs up to a mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, which does not appear to care.

00:03 Sarah says to Evenia, "I haven't been around in months. And yes that was rude."

00:04 Elaine Moreau waves.

00:04 Aisling the Fox quickly drains a shot of Irish whiskey.

00:04 Aisling the Fox puts a shot glass in a bin of dirty dishes beside a sleek black trash bin.

00:04 Wendy Arroyo says, "Well it wasn't really the Torus at all."

00:05 I see no "constantine" here.

00:05 Elaine Moreau asks, "So what's up?"

00:05 Wendy Arroyo says, "More like, the last time pilots bunched up on a space station."

00:06 --
To Esteemed President Best and members of the AEU government:
The AEU Pilot Corps is concerned with talk of potentially withdrawing our contributions to the Accord, both in personnel and funding. We believe this to be a mistake, and strongly urge the government to reconsider this action. The threat of the Outsiders, the IFS as well as attacks by pirate factions still occur on a fairly frequent basis. The Outsiders especially, are a grave concern. They could return at any time, and if nothing else, overwhelm us all just by sheer numbers.

In order to combat the threats both within our own borders and in alliance space in general, we need to all work together. The Accord functions as a central means for all of the alliances who are involved to contribute resources and money to make those resources into something useable to combat the threats that we all encounter on a daily basis. Additionally, the Accord functions as a means of gathering the relevant intelligence which we tend to use in order to combat our enemies effectively and with minimal losses.

The AEU has some of the best scientists, who have made some incredible discoveries and helped further our efforts to combat the dangers we all face. Our navy, full of the bravest men and women in the alliance have fought valiantly in many engagements against Outsiders, IFS and even Allied Pirates. Even the civilian pilots have served in an exemplary manner, having once been
00:06  at the forefront of helping to defend all of the alliances in times of invasion. However, as great as our scientists are, as skilled and brave as our great men and women in the navy are and as dedicated to the defense of our space as the civilian pilots may be, the AEU cannot combat the threats to our space alone. We need to remain in the Accord therefore, to share intelligence and receive intelligence in turn. We must continue funding the Accord, so that they can continue to build the ships and weapons which we can use to assist in combatting our enemies. We need to commit personnel to help defend the space of all other alliances, so that we too can be safe. We need to allow our scientists to work with the Accord and the EAOS, so that we can continue to gain advantages over those who would desire to see nothing more than the downfall of the alliances, and more importantly, the extinction of the entire human race.

We thank you for taking the time to review our statement, and hope that you will ultimately do what is in the best interests of humanity, and our alliance.

00:07 Cataleya Sandes walks in and moves to stand near Casen, though smiles at Melinda. "Hey." she says, turning a warm smile to Casen after, though she mostly stand on the perifery of the group.

00:07 Melinda rubs her forehead.

00:07 Wendy Arroyo sits down on a padded black stool at the bar.

00:07 Elaine Moreau asks, "So why aren't we shooting the cruiser?"

00:07 Wendy Arroyo says, "What."

00:07 Nissi Valdaire says, "Well, somebody will get talked into getting them out sooner or later probably."

00:07 Wendy Arroyo says, "Why, to what end."

00:08 Aisling the Fox says, "I am sure Fringe government would enjoy provoking war."

00:08 Cataleya frowns slightly as she hears the conversation, and moves to hover.

00:08 Damien Goss takes a sip of a shot of Irish whiskey.

00:08 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a chilled martini.

00:08 Wendy Arroyo says, "Not to ruin any parties here, but the navy is sort of perfectly within their rights here."

00:08 Evenia says to a chilled martini, "You and me. We will make sense of this, somehow."

00:08 You grin at Evenia Callseah.

00:08 Elaine Moreau says, "They're also enemies of humanity by supporting the rogue navy."

00:08 Aisling the Fox exclaims, "I must admit though I did not thing Fringe would be ones to strike AEU first. That is surprise. But go ahead!"

00:08 The music on the sound system fades away, and after a few moments a new song starts up with a soft blare of the horns and a thumping bass beat.

00:09 Nissi Valdaire says, "An external threat will probably see people rallying to Best if anything."

00:09 Casen Thale nods to Nissi Valdaire. "Quite."

00:09 Elaine Moreau asks, "They're already rallied to Best. How bad does it have to get before people stop sitting on their hands and actually do something?"

00:09 Evenia says to Elaine, "We were told what to do just yesterday."

00:09 Wendy Arroyo says, "I'm going to voice my silent and entirely unofficial support from thr bottom of a glass."

00:09 Evenia says to Elaine, "And what not to do."

00:09 Aisling the Fox says, "That was then this is now."

00:09 Elaine says to Evenia, "We were told the government's position on the matter."

00:09 Aisling the Fox asks, "What do you do today?"

00:10 Wendy Arroyo says, "I drink."

00:10 Cataleya looks up at the menu. "I'm gonna have a drink before I punch the bar."

00:10 Melinda Michaels says, "Gnna say that war isn't a terrible idea. However, doing it without the go ahead of governments is."

00:10 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sometimes the thing to do isn't the most obvious and immediate blunt force."

00:10 Sarah Bellamy orders a fluted crystal glass of iced tea garnished with a slice of fresh lemon.

00:10 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

00:10 Elaine Moreau says, "Sitting around waggling our fingers at them hasn't worked. It's only made things worse. It's time for action. Especially since action has already started."

00:10 Morris Corlew says into his mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Depends on the enemy mostly."

00:10 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Radiate, guidance, illuminate."

00:11 Wendy Arroyo says, "There's no action anywhere."

00:11 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Hold on."

00:11 Evenia Callseah says into her glossy obsidian metachannel FTL communicator, "In most cases, flare first."

00:11 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "It depends on your enemies but, flare whenever you can."

00:11 The music on the sound system fades away, and after a few moments a new song starts up with a soft blare of the horns and a thumping bass beat.

00:11 Tobias Hawthorne takes a sip of a fluted crystal glass of iced tea garnished with a slice of fresh lemon.

00:11 Cataleya Sandes quickly drains a cup of hot Irish cream coffee.

00:11 Cataleya Sandes puts a cup in a bin of dirty dishes beside a sleek black trash bin.

00:11 Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Against bombers and such, radiate then flare."

00:11 Cataleya Sandes orders a crystal glass of chilled Chardonnay.

00:11 Damien Goss says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Use flash when you get a chance to interrupt that bad guy as he's preparing to use an ability."

00:11 Evenia Callseah shrugs. "Let's not get into the complicated shit about when to radiate first, when to illuminate or flash first."

02:19 Nissi Valdaire nods.

02:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So i'm not mad because i'm grounded. I'm pissed... madder than hell! taht we can't do justice."

02:19 The music on the sound system fades away, and after a few moments a new song starts up with a soft blare of the horns and a thumping bass beat.

02:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That we can't do juseice that is."

02:20 Nissi Valdaire says, "Now that you're at this point... you guys should look for allies, maybe. Within the AEU I mean. Other people tired of Best."

02:20 A wailing sax solo swells above the soft jazz music playing on the restaurant's sound system.

02:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I agree. Perhaps the patriots, if they aren't just playing both sides will have heard our message yesterday."

02:21 Over the thumping bass and brushed drums of the jazz playing in the background, a muted trumpet plays a soulful, wandering melody.

02:21 Nissi Valdaire nods.

02:22 Nissi Valdaire says, "Gotta get a foothold somewhere else I guess, somewhere you can call home base."

02:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

02:37 [The Torus; Torus Restaurant]
The glory of the endless expanse of starry space is revealed here through the transparent dome over this small but elegant restaurant. A spiral staircase in the center of the restaurant leads down to the main level of the station, and luxurious black carpeting covers the floor, extending outward to a long silver-trimmed black plasteel bar encircling the room. Cushioned black leather bar stools are arranged along the bar, and on the other side is a black plasteel waiter droid which moves with quiet efficiency to fill customers' orders. A two-meter-high wall of shiny black plasteel around the outside of the bar contains notices and a few other photographs and mementos. You see a framed photo of several pilots gleefully kicking a downed Outsider, a large glossy photo of a beautiful green planet in space, a small photograph of a pile of burning money, a large glossy AFW promotional poster, a large glossy framed photo of Benjamin Masterson, and a large sparkly white banner with 'Hapy Anibversery Piolets' scrawled across it in orange letters hanging on various walls.

03:02 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:17 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

03:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

04:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well if I end up going to prison, I doubt I'll ever get out Love. So I wouldn't blame you if you didn't wait. Your life needs to go on."

04:12 You say to Lily, "No, I'll wait because if there's a chance you'll get out, I want you to be able to take me back."

04:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:12 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:13 You say, "I inow."

04:13 You say, "But I'll just keep hoping."

04:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The other women got like at least 3 consecutive life sentences which carry I think each a 30 year term."

04:14 You exclaim, "Wow!"

04:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

04:14 You say, "But none of you had a chance to carry out the plan, so you technically didn't do anything."

04:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I mean in this time, people live a long long time but I sure doubt they would ever come back to pilot."

04:15 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:16 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

04:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

04:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well that is true."

04:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But sometimes when you even indicate you are willing to participate in an act of what could be called treason, there could be consequences."

04:21 You say, "I know."

04:21 Shule nods sadly.

04:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok Love. I have absolutely no regrets. I will lay my life on the line to do whatever it takes to defend and to protect mankind."

05:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

05:07 [Newbie Help] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Okay guys so I've not really been in a situation like this, which brings about this question. If you are rifting some place with an autolander station at your destination, but the travel getting there is going to take a few hours, is it safe to go take a shower or go get something to eat while you're traveling, since you will presumably land if you get t here before you return to the keys?"

05:07 [Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "In theory. I've had the autolander fail to work a few times, but that's generally what they're for."

05:08 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "In theory yes. But there is always the chance of an enemy ship at the other end. If that's the case and it shoots you, you will not autoland. The other option is to trim down, slowing your speed more so you'll be back at the keys in time."

05:09 [Newbie Help] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "That's an excellent idea. I'm just not 100 percent certain I can stay planted at this keyboard for four hours without having to leave at some point. So I will trim down. Thanks Eve."

06:19 [Newbie Help] Ayla Wyatt transmits, "I'm not too sure if this is an IC or OOC question so... here goes. I can't seem to figure out where I can buy a Fringe asteroid hauler, and I've not found anything in the helpfiles about it. Am I missing something? I also looked through the handbook but all it says next to asteroid hauler is "Do not buy this""

06:19 [Newbie Help] Blake Madison transmits, "That's because their are multiple ships that can perform that function."

06:19 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you read the book a little more carefully, you will locate the other asteroid hauler in question. Otherwise, asking where you can buy a ship is a fine IC question."

06:20 [Newbie Help] Ayla Wyatt transmits, "Thanks you guys, will do."

06:20 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You're most welcome."
