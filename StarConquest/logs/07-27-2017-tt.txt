Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Residential Structure; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Residential Structure; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

This docking bay is relatively quiet compared to most other similar facilities.
As with other EAOS docking bays, the entire structure appears open to space, yet
no air escapes. Signs indicate that the lobby is on the level above, and
Spaceport facilities are below.
The one-person cargo hauler "Point A", the two-person Accord gemini
"Quinacridone Rose", and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You can go north, south, up, and down.

The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,

we're full if that is the case."

can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok ready whenever."

course I know you're blue. I hadn't drunk that much that night."

notice."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well if you were wearing a
silly white hat, and sang stupid songs, then I'd probably not notice, but no, it
suits you in an odd way."

funny ideas about drinking strange vials from the megapod. The others that had

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Residential Structure; Docking Bay.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on 10 July 2317 GST. Time remaining: 24 days,

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained
4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU
Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the two-person light
corvette "Funeral Dirge".
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Greetings
Aliloren, and welcome to the civilian pilot corps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll do my
best to answer any question you may have, don't hesitate to ask."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think that guy
might be in the League."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, you're
right, I read it wrong I guess."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "More's the
pity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like we
had a bunch of cadets about a month ago."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, he'll
never be able to sit again. Bunch a no-chair-using Leaguers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have you made
any great inellectual breakthroughs on anything we discussed yesterday?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nothing I
would call progress, no. I've been in touch with someone about oen of the
things, but not sure when I'll get any info on that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's
something, at least."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also, you
were right about the restrictions. They are restrictions that are already placed
on us as part of the Accord agreement."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that makes
sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's too bad, I
thought we were on to something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, it's
still nice information, though a bit rattling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I also didn't
realize how complete the Napa's hold was on the government."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's one
thing when you think you are dealing with someone who seems a little nuts. It's
another thing entirely to realize you are going up against a party with well
thought out and logical points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So some of the
other strategies we talked about might not really be feasible."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I know
what you mena."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone coughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, the NAPA
controls the whoel government right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Still can't
for the life of me figure out why all the pilots voted for him, not a single one
seems to like him, or his policies."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And before
you say it, yes I'm aware that he was the only one promising to keep the corps
open."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I just don't
like the idea of that being the only thing our pilots care about."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's too bad
the AAPA has lost so much standing in recent years. Not that they had a
candidate anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's the
party my views probably fall the most under, though I don't mind the Gren Earth
party either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er. The Green
Earth party."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah it really is an awesome one, thanks.
[MTTS] Ulias: Although it kinda sucks that I can't have more than one person in
my shuttle room now, but ti's still cool and realistic.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, I can't
believe I can't use my beloved grapple anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm sorry Eli, this
whole thing exploded in my face."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just... stop
Vernos. I know how you feel on the matter, but wounds take time to heal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I appreciate
that you are trying to make it up to me in your ownway, but it still takes time
to get over something like this."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"

a big white glowing felo kitten
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, speckled white fur,
possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked white claws
visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes with vertical
pupils. It puts out a subtle white bioluminescence tinged with light green.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Not awake, will do later."

You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

awake either. But spread the word."
launch
You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock
clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul" and the three-person clipper
"Firestorm" are landed here.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship
is in space.
You see an improved temporary wormhole drive and an overstuffed red chair here.
You can go north and south.

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "RATS worry me."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm afraid that one day
we're going to see something else, something we haven't seen yet."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I just popped about sixteen
of them. They really beat my ship to hell."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, Yeah I bet they
did."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well a bunch of us fringers
went out and destroyed them where we could find them. There was rats in the
first five sectors I landed in and we decided it was better to thin them out
some. Honestly, we should probably do more nests. A lot of sectors where cadets
are flying a lot too."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Had help from peacekeepers
with one group though, that helped."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I would have if I wasn't out
here at 285."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, more nests would
help. In particular it concerns me how some older pilots say things like they're
not really a threat."

[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Agreed."

but I don't know how much interest we'd have."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Let's believe in

[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We can do it!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "AEU sectors have been
oddly rat-free lately."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Every time I check the
frontier sectors they're always empty."

them."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In all seriousnes, they have
seemed to be really prominent in unclaimed and fringe space. I didn't see any
when I tried AEU or league space at all. Makes me wonder if there's a series or
nests or something out our way."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I have a theory about
roid dogs pertaining to RATS. Ithink they might be some sort of asteroid
harvesting version. It's strange that they aren't ever seen closer to human
space though, with the rest of the RATS."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, when we do nests
later, let's look around Fringe space."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "For that matter, I wonder
where all the rocks have gone."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's an interesting theory."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's hard to say, there
are many that believe they are just a myth, though I saw a photo once of
someones hatch that was definitley torn into by somethin glarge and strong on an
asteroid."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Oh, some were heard on our
last hauling trip out."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Or felt or whatever."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well most myths have some form
of truth behind them, even if it's not the truth reported."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I had heard that
someone thought that they heard one, yeah."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Plus, I figure, since there
are space whales and dragons, why not roid dogs."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No reason to bleieve
that they didn't in my opinion."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Dragons? Now that's a new one
on me."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Too bad you folks
didn't take your roid cannons and set a trap. Tie the damn thing up in cables
and bring it back."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yes, Lexie. I know
it sounds far fetched but space dragons are most definitely real."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yes, there are dragons and
other interesting space creatures if you go places. I have seen the pictures."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn things are as big
as battlecruisers, maybe ven bigger."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And they breathe
plasma."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've never seen one
myself, so I could be off on some of that, I've only seen pictures."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Note to self, do not go to the
same night clbs as Johann and Eli."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When everyone gets
back, I know a couple of them have albums with images of these things."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I wouldn't be surprised
though. My mom and dad used to tell me stories of weird stuff they'd encountered
while they were out working."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's even jellyfish
like things. And the space whales emit a signal that some folks have taken to
calling a song. It screws up a ships equipment, Ibelieve making it so that it
can't move. Lukcily though the wahels are not aggressive, or so I"ve been told."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. the whales, I
mean."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If they're really that big I
wonder if they're some sort of organic ship."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, that's my
belief."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Someone tried to argue
that they weren't because they watched two of the dragons.. or maybe it was the
lions? tear apart a bari spreader. But we attack spreaders too so I don't think
that argument is really valid."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The dragons do lay eggs
though."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No. Not at all. And if the
bari grow mold on them it might be more destructive to their systems than they
are to ours."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A seagull flaps by the window.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with ham and
cheese.
Tara nods "My biggest motivation to become a pilot is to experience it for
myself, and well, ironically, you mention a seeker of truth." she pauses,
grinning to Eli My favorite kind of novels were always about those daring
adventurers who go off into the unknown, pioneering for others, breaking
traditions and taboos along the way." she laughs "My parents biggest mistake was
trying to sensor the stuff and keep me away from it when they learned of my
interest in it. What happens when you do that to a teenager?"
chuckle 'Yeah, bad idea.
You chuckle. "Yeah, bad idea."
Eli looks relieved at Tara's words.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So um.. I'm with Lexie
on this whole dream thing, you ever gonna get to that?"
tra gen Yeah, what was the dream. Stop killing us with suspense.
[General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, what
was the dream. Stop killing us with suspense."
A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "But anyway. This
dream. Somehow. The clipper could carry 3 battlesuits. And so 3 of us went out
to see if we couldn't do GMG with 3 people. But when we got out there. The
clipper wouldn't let us out. And it kept like. Turning it's systems on and off.
And got a mind of it's own. Then somehow. Orby started ignoring Eli's commands
and got out the airlock. And destroyed the thing."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Ah.. not just a thinker, but a rebellious one..
Perfect."

out.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well yeah. We ended
up in a pod, but Orby saved us."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, the clipper was evil."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "All the evil
clippers."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what it sounds
like. And a hoverbot was either really stron, or the clipper was really weak."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I fucking love
clippers, but that was a strange dream."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sounds like you
need to lay off the drugs."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No you told the dream while I

[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "You and your coffee, you'll

A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes that time they almost decided to
lead an expedition.
Tara lets out a laugh "My parents are ..really, really wealthy, especially for
people who live a life on a planet. Heavy into businesses, and investments, you
know? and they play that well." she shook her head "They wanted me in on that,
especially my father. He's running a business for really fancy clothing, you
know?" a touch of anger comes to her face and voice "and he wanted to use me as
some model, but ..I guess enough on that?" she shrugs, looking to Eli, curious
"What about you?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh Ather. You just
reminded me by talking. That I have 2 questions for you. Do you still have that
airlock cycle plant. And can you send me the parts list for that um. The
asteroid scanner thing. If you could be so...Well not kind. but considerate?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Tara, Vernos?
Nests for glory?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I think we'll have to give it
up as a bad show Constantine."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Kindness is an
irrelevant concept."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know, it's sad."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But yes, I do
have both."
A seagull flaps by the window.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rats win the day."
A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the
four-person mule "Lion's Den" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, not both
cycle plants, but the list and the plant."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "It'll be so grand when I have the
other cycling plant."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Is it 150 mill for
that plant? I'm guessing so."
Eli grins at Tara, "Oh, I come from pretty humble beginnings. I was born here on
New Earth here. My dad was a carpenter, so as you can imagine, we didn't have
much money. Everything's all plasteel and transparasteel these days. Not really
the best profession to be in."

Shule sits back and listens.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Right."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I mail you said
beautiful credits, could you get me one ready?"
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But he was stubbron about it, We were always
travelling, never really staying in one place. He used to tell me stories about
the things that were going on, civilian pilots and all that. I'll never forget
the day he told me about the Outsider ship sowing up.""
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hard to make friends, that way."

Tara Flores speaks into her ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Maybe later? Relaxing
at the lounge right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure, just
checking."
Tara Flores finishes off a hot cup of espresso.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Anyways, one day we relocated to Hyperion, Jacktown
folks still like to use wood in their construction. So there was a lot of work
there, we finally settled down. Just a little apartment in Jacktown, but still."
Tara finishes her espresso, setting the cup side and keeping her attention on
Eli, her expression obviously curious.
Eli's eyes grow dreamy as he speaks, "but that trip over there though.. looking
out into that vast infinte void? My imagination went wild with what could be out
there."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "In a little
while."
You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the four-person mule
"Lion's Den" lift off the landing pad and head into space.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh yeah. No rush on
it. But I'll send the credits so it's done."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "He didn't want me to do it of course, did everything
he could to discourage me. But I started waiting tables and saving every credit
I could get my hands on to get ino the academy, and spent my nights on the roof
of hte apartments staring into the night sky. Not a lot of light pollution over
there, on Hyperion. I could see everything."
'I love Hyperion.
You say, "I love Hyperion."
A pair of engineers suddenly begin a heated political debate.
Tara smiles a little "Sounds like theres a lot of things I need to see."

You nod and grin at Tara Flores.
Someone pauses in the doorway, glances around the room, then turns and leaves.
-tara There is so much to see out there.
You say to Tara, "There is so much to see out there."
"Well, one day, when he saw that I wasn't going to give up, he gave me this..."
Eli thumbs a small silver dragonfly on a chain thoughtfully.  "He said it was my
mother's she died in childbirth, I don't know if Imentioned that or not. He also
gave me all the credits he'd been saving to buy a home. Said that my mother
would have wanted me to follow my dream , that she always loved watching the
dragonflies fly, and that she would have loved that I wanted to be like them.
And so , here I am"he academy, and spent my nights on the roof of hte apartments

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Ug."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Please gloss over that last part."
You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Real. Decent. Coffee.
You make my heart glad."
Tara Flores puts a cup in a shiny chrome trash bin.
Tara Flores puts a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" in a
sturdy dark green canvas backpack.
A nearby pilot lectures at length about why having diplomatic relations with
other alliances is stupid.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Whew.. sorry I got um.. carried away with myself
there."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a sip of a curiously shaped bottle of water.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I guess I could have just said "I really, really

not worth doing. I'm enjoying myself as a pilot."
'I agree.
You say, "I agree."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smiles and nods to Tara Flores.
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Sadly the Union doesn't support exploration as much
as it used to, but that hasn't stopped me from getting out there when I can."
You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by
loud swearing.
'Yeah, that is sad.

going on expiditons run by pilot's of other alliances either. It's a good way to
get experience."
'Most definitely.
You say, "Most definitely."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And I'd bring him out
when people pissed me off."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Best is robot infiltrator."
A black-clad security officer comes in, looks around briefly, then walks back
out.

You say to Eli, "Oh goodness. Yeah, I do."
Tara smiles some and nods "I hope to. As far as I know my older sister followed
in my footsteps." she says, a bit of scorn in her voice. "So I won't let her out
pace me." she said competitively.

You grin at Tara Flores. "That's the spirit."

Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well, I certainly hope she's as opened minded and
eager to get out there as you seem to be Ms. Flores."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Never fear, we'll
find you anyway."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a bite of a piping hot turnover filled with ham and
cheese.
A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the
one-person cargo hauler "Vortex Industries 414" as it settles down upon the
nearby landing pad.
You hear someone happily recount a recent asteroid mining victory.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

velocity increase and airlock cycle increase hybrid."
Eli says to Tara, "They varie, there's some that are cheap though. There's an
apartment complex three blocks north of the Spaceport if you don't mind living
underground. They're nice apartments despite not having a view. There's also the
Residential structure in the sector known as The Calm, if you prefer to live on
a station."

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The computer reports that the one-person fighter "Trinaos" has jumped out of the

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

remind me. It's all Kesi's fault that this shit is still there. I submitted a

From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli is plain and has a slightly pudgy build,
fair skin, grey eyes, and shoulder-length mirror finish chrome hair and he
stands about five feet and ten inches tall and looks to be in his late twenties.
He is wearing a pair of silver-rimmed glasses, a long white coat, a dark green
AEU t-shirt, a pair of relaxed fit midnight blue jeans, and a pair of black
synthleather ship boots.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I made it in time,
Eli."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh hey, he's
there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Don't
talk in your comm, Eli. You're live."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey puts down a silver projector.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey switches a backdrop projector to "AEU
phoenix symbol."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey stands before an AEU phoenix symbol
backdrop in a long white coat. He straightens a dark green AEU t-shirt and
clears his throat.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver
pocket watch momentarily.
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Eli, we see you. Can we
have your autograph?"
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "Greetings once again citizens of
the Union and the rest of the galaxy. I've returned here today to speak again of
the pressing issue of Outccord and to clear up a few misconceptions about my
broadcast, and to offer proof against the accusations in the media that my
broadcast contained lies."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would like
the autograph on my butt please."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "I would like to begin, by
addressing what has been called a lie from my broadcast last week, the
desctruction of the EAOS experimental structure. I did make a mistake by saying
it was destroyed by the Outsiders. It was, instead, destroyed by our other alien
threat, the IFS. A seperate alien threat that not much is known about. This fact
changes nothing however, it only adds further weight to the importance of the
Accord of Free Worlds."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli nods grimly.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "I would also like to address the
recent claims that the destruction of the planet Grenwold is a hoax, and that
the images I showed of it last week were just images of asteroid chunks that
have always been there. This is not only untrue, it is an insult to our
intelligence and to the name of the brave hero, Benjamin Masterson, who's death
is undeniably linked to the desctruction of Grenwold by the Outsiders."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli gesticulates with his hands while he speaks,
"during the time these events occured in the resistance, the Outsiders were
unable to locate the station that was serving as resistance headquarters. this
was the sinister purpose behind the destruction of such a beautiful green
planet. they destroyed the planet with their phase destabilizing beam, and used
the path of it's debris to discover the location of the station."
From a phone-based holoemitter: "Something happened, that caused the station to
have a power failure, I'm unaware if this was something that the Outsiders did,
or if it was a result of debris hitting the station." Eli Grey frowns. "Either
way, the people inside found themselves trapped. That is when Benjamin Masterson
rushed to the problem and somehow restored enough power for the docking bay
doors to open, allowing the people inside to escape, he could not escape himself
however. He stayed behind to make sure the doors remained open. And so it was
that he was the only one left inside when the Outsiders destroyed the station."
From a phone-based holoemitter: the ripples on Eli's blue skin slow for a
moment, and it's color deepens as he speaks. "to say that Grenwold was never
destroyed, that it has always been just a debris field, is to spit on the good
name of the hero of humanity, Benjamin Masterson. If not for his sacrifice, the
resistance would have ended there and then. Or perhaps those that claim it never
happened also maintain that Masterson did not die? That these events simply
never occured.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli stares into the camera for a long moment,
letting his words hang in the air.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "I would like to show some brief
footage now. I shot this footage of two of the Grenwold chunks the other day,
not long after the news outlets began publishing stories about Grenwold being a
hoax. Be warned, these images are disturbing."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey sets a silver projector upright and
turns it on. The three-dimensional full-color show begins.
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] as the image starts, it is
shakey and hard to make out at first. then, the camera steadies and the scene
becomes clear.
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] Scraped clean of the
topsoil that once covered it, this large flat piece of rock nonetheless bears
traces of the   creatures who once lived here. Embedded in the scorched
limestone are the petrified bones of   their distant   ancestors, their lively
domiciles now nothing more than shallow pits in the ancient rock. The remnant of
the   lost world turns slowly against the starry black sky, the shadows deep,
the land forever
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] the camera zooms in on the
clearly visible bones and fossils. You hear the voice of Eli Grey saying, "This
is one of the chunks of Grenwold. As you can clearly see, there, those are bones
of the precursors to the creatures that once called this planet their home.
Asteroids do not contain fossil records."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost
to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] the image goes dark as the
camera is shut off, but only briefly before it's replaced by another unsettling
scene.
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] Gently terraced rock forms
the surface of this planetary remnant. Etched in its rough surface are the
shapes of tiny shells and delicately-leaved plants hidden for countless
millennia beneath the oceans, long dead and lost to modern knowledge. The
countless stars overhead bear silent witness as the rock turns slowly in the
void.
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] the camera zooms in once
more, showing the fossilized remains of sea life and plants. A spacesuited glove
comes into frame, pointing at the clearly visible remains. you hear the voice of
Eli Grey saying, "Here, again, you can see what is clearly the remains of sea
creatures and plants. Do asteroids have oceans? I think not."
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] The images transitions once
more to show eli Grey standing in what appears to be the control room of a
starship, wearing a long white coat.
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] The ripples on his blue
skin seem more agitated than usual, and the light briefly glints off of a small
silver dragonfly around his neck as he speaks. "doubtless some will say that
this still does not prove that the Outsiders destroyed this world, Despite it
being a well known historical fact from mankinds recent history. but I ask you
what else could have ended what is clearly a planet, so suddenly? In such a way
that the   fossil record has stayed intact?"
From a phone-based holoemitter: [From the projector] eli sweeps his arm to point
out of the viewport behind him, "the answer is simple, it is the Outsiders phase
destabilizing beam. the same weapon that took the life of Benjamin Masterson
mere moments after Grenwold was destroyed."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey quickly turns off a silver projector.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli stares grimly into the camera.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "So, so as you can plainly see in
that footage, not only did Grenwold exist, but it was certainly destroyed by
something powerful, and unnatural. To say that threats like this come second to
pirates, is like stopping in the middle of a raging forest fire, to worry about
a snake on the ground."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey says, "It is truly threats like this,
and the IFS, the the Union must not leave the Accord. Humanity is already
extremely outclassed by these alien threats. The Outsiders would love nothing
more than for the Accord to be weakened in this way, it is perhaps, even the
moment they've been waiting for."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey exclaims, "The Union must not withdrawl
from the Accord! We must stand together with all humans, in the face of our
extinction!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good job, Eli."
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli says, "Thank you for all who have tuned in
tonight, I hope you have heeded my words well. May you al find peace, and joy in
your lives." He then poses dramatically in front of an AEU phoenix symbol
backdrop raising his fist in the air and shouting, "For the Union, the Accord,
and humanity!" He turns to leave the studio revealing a large dragonfly on the
back of his coat, leaving an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop hanging on the holo for
the remainder of the broadcast.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey walks out.
From a phone-based holoemitter: Eli Grey picks up a silver projector.

better, I could have filled more time. It snuck up on me."

[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Jus tkeep the

[General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Also, I just

[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "SOmebody bored and

[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Same old thing."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I would most
likely agree with the "Q news" one."
[General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Go smoke in a

[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Joe did tha
tonce."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The

[General Communication] Eli Grey, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Your face is

[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Much as I hate to say
it...I'm going to sort of make like Ted here and say if you want to know what
the news is, stay home. I leave to get away from news ordinarily, I'm not going
to send home requesting it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cheers.
[General Communication] Johann Schraft cheers.
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm so proud."

[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Is joke."

a ctualy a good secondary weapon."
