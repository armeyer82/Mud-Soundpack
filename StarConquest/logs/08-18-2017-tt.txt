Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

as a favorite too."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, it's cool
Evenia, since you pretty much set one another up. The spinward does a critical
shot, while RATS does nanoblade or something, and it's pretty much an instant
kill long as you don't get interrupted, or unless you're facing like, Templar.
Plasma is arguably more efficient, because the bolt packs more of a punch and
doesn't take too long to fire off but the RATS and spinward have more tricks up
their sleeves when you're in a bind."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "After trying a few combos."
[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Erik, I imagine
it'd go reasonably OK long as one or both have plasma."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Hmmm. Yeah, I can see how
that'd be cool. I've really only ever seen a spinward in action like twice, so I
forget what all they're capable of. But when you put it like that..."

similar abilities really speed things up in the graves, and incidentally require
much elss ammunition."

Dear Tara,
As Founder of SEAS, I would like to extend an invitation to you to join SEAS.
I just wanted to let you know that we're still very eager to have you join SEAS.
I also want to emphasize that we are a full facility organization with a
well-equipped fleet of starships to rent as well as we have two cruisers which
are supported and room for an additional cruiser for a qualified pilot.
We also have a Genetics Lab and a Range office for monitoring the iability of
Temporary Space Stations.
There is no requirement of you to contribute earned Points or Credits. All
contributions are voluntary as our primary goal is to help you to develop to
your fullest potential. At some point when you feel that you would like to
contribute towards organizational goals, you would be welcomed to but never
required unless there was some unforeseen circumstance which depleted our
resources. So far though, SEAS has nearly 30 billion of available credits plus
ample balances in support and insurance funds. Shule and I have put a lot of
effort towards building up SEAS so that we could help motivated newer pilots
such as yourself. The only exception would be that when you become Cruiser
qualified and SEAS takes on the responsibility to support your Cruiser, then we
would appreciate credits contributed towards its support. We still want to
assure that the Corps has enough Cruisers to aid in the defense of humanity so
provided you are an active member, if your income level is still insufficient to
contribute, unless SEAS budget could not sustain your Cruiser, then we would
waive the credits contribution requirement.
Last, we are selective in who we will choose to recruit as members. Although we
enjoy socializing, we are focused and serious about our work. We want our
members to represent strong ethical values as well. Shule and I have been
observing your progress and we believe that you represent these core values.
Last, i am pleased that you chose to participate in an Expedition. Although this
Expedition was led by a Fringe Pilot and Exploration is not the mainstay of the
Fringe, I am pleased that you were adventurous enough to participate.
We will look forward to the opportunity to add you as a member of SEAS.
Please contact Constantine, shule or myself when you are ready to join and we
will invite you in.
Kind regards
Lily Kaise

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

strong neck muscles."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Or go bald."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Hmmm, I could go for the full
body mutagen-muscle treatment."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Just having a gigantic neck
would look even sillier than having massive muscles everywhere would, I think."

[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Are you just now coming
around, Morris?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Morris, we really have to stop
saying the exact same thing at the exact same time like this."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I was round all day
yesterday."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Why's that Ted? I been sayin
it most my life? If you wanna say it to, feel free."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "So've I, it's just, like,
stereo."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Didn't know anyone could have
a problem with stereo."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Is there anything that some
people wouldn't have a problem with? I mean, we are all different, that's life
after all."
[General Communication] "I dunno. You were the one wanted to stop talkin in
stereo." Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Anyway, it was only a little
comment, not like an issue thing."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I know."

into my soul, Morris."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't that just the coolest
thing?"
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Mildly unnerving, if I'm
honest."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "But eh!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's kinda what Nissi said."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh, Dakhal, did you need
somethin?"
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd say a million credits,
but I think wish was answered a long time ago."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh?"
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Indeed. It seems like I've
found as many artifacts as my luck is willing to give me though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Remember, it has an open door
policy."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Cargo Hauler."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That the second or third? Most
my reviews seem to come right after I get somethin delivered in under a minute."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Third."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I see you, Ali."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "How inconvenient."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I know. I have a blinding
headache now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "War that cloaking coat Ali."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wear I mean."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

Minor Change:
Ships that are unable to salvage (fighters, certain transports, etc) can no
longer deploy atmospheric scoops. This was a bit of an oversight, and we deeply
apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.
Atmospheric scoops on ships that can no longer do so, of course, be transferred
off.

I'm not careful."

we're all hungry."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. These minin drones,
metals, and ore ain't too appetizin neither."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You could always have a
little nibble. What's the worst that could happen?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No thanks."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Now I'm dreaming of a baked
potato oven. I might need to find out who you got your pizza oven made through
Morris, see if they can't swing that."

chunks of baked potato."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "I been thinkin of lookin for
somebody to make a baked potato thingamajig."

different beautiful baked potatoes. At the press of a button...Oh. c'mere.

than that."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Wow."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How far up with stuff do you
go?"

hour and twenty. I'm sure there must be a faster way to do it, though it always
eluded me."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Build less probably."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Probably. I go up to the
enhanced processor."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I stick with improved."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah. That's the difference."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have 41K metals or so, so I
kinda have to if I wanna be done in a reasonable amount of time."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Each improved supports 2 drill
sites and 1 deep boarer."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I don't recall exactly what I
last built... three years since I did one of those. I usually used thirty one
drones though."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I use 36, not sure I need all
of them really though, just a case of how low can I go."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thing is, when they're
fightin, they ain't transportin metals. So the enhanced gives 'em more of a
chance to catch up."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "In the early days, I used
twenty-six quite successfully."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mine's done now after 3 hours
12 minutes. But I'm waitin on an attack to finish."

longer than that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How many metals you start
with?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I forgot to check today, it'll
have gone up since last time."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I think I was around thirty-seven
thousand."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm sure you're way higher
than that now."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Considerin I get 41K or so and
I have probably at least 5K less industry than you got."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I doubt it, I thought metals
increased as you mined more asteroids?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Industry."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I should run one sometime just to
see if I can remember how."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It was bad enough after 3
weeks."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Huh?"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Okay, I'm transfering everything
today, no sorting and expelling. Lets see the difference."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Remembering how to run one,
haven't done one since before the trip."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Heh, it's been three and a
quarter years for me."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh dang. This is gonna be my
best payin mine yet."
