00:11:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok I'll get around to it once I can get someone to build the imager and not so sure as I only have about 7 lenses so it can wait."

00:12:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

00:13:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "But yeah... that wasn't my wisest investment!"

00:13:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:14:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Interesting though, you can get the Planetary Surveyor in the Cartography shop."

00:14:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So that's still available to us."

00:21:59 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

00:22:13 You nod.

00:23:52 You laugh.

00:23:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway if you want to know where to get the Planetary Surveyor it's the room to the angle towards the Northeast from the Cartographer's shop."

00:24:54 You say, "Ah, ok."

00:24:58 You say, "Cool."

00:24:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm be right back and wow I don't think one can get the QE Nymore. Sure glad I did."

00:32:09 I don't see that here.

00:33:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh so if you didn't read the Exploration board, of course know-it-all Morris responds to my message about not bringing Felo and says, we've already covered it Lily. Johann hadn't said anything in his preliminary post to everyone. So guess what, Johann responded that he had only mentioned it in the Old Earth Lounge, essentially, so I was correct to post what I did. I sure got the last laugh over this one."

Subject: Letter to Nissi Valdaire in Defense of SEAS
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 23:00 17 September 2317 GST
--
Hi nissi,
Up until 'know-it-all' Morris formed his own organization, I did fairly well with station building. I was only maintaining the Asteroid Station in 285 but Morris kept clamoring for it which I mentioned to Melinda as I really was ready to let him take it over. Melinda kept saying that he shouldn't always get his way and not to cave- into him. However, Morris has been excessively jealous of SEAS since its inception and done everything possible to prevent our growth. So when Morris left starseekers and when he established his organization, Melinda wrote to me as follows:
hi,
Morris is not yet in a position to earn anything from stations. However, as I have done for every org, including Seas, when he is able to begin earning megacredits, he gets preferencial treatment. He is planning to vassalize so we'll want him to get megacredits quickly. Joel even got this done for him when he was starting out.
Melinda
Therefore, when I was ready to build the next Asteroid Processor in 285, Morris started pressuring me to include him. I wrote him and informed him that Melinda had specifically specified that he not be included just yet. However, if I had a slot, that I would be more than happy to accomodate him which I did from day one. I know he likely pitched a fit with you Nissi. Still, please understand that I was following Melinda's directive and had to be straight with him. I did accomodate him and never left him nor anyone off of the processor who I could obtain Modules from. Joel has been very difficult to deal with because he wouldn't provide modules so I had to hunt for them. So recently, he finally loaded a couple of Cores into SEAS Warehouse and then ather had his Tantrum. So I know that you want to hear everyone but I honestly believe that SEAS nor I have been given a fair deal here. Morris, as you know makes a lot of clamor about everything. I realize that you should listen to your own Alliance pilots first. Other than this, I certainly would appreciate knowing what the other issues were as I have worked diligently to maintain the Asteroid Processor in 285 and to be certain that there was little downtime. I've had my Trustees available to deploy the Asteroid Processor whenever I couldn't.
I have worked very hard, per the available time that I am at work on the effort to obstruct and to campaign against Outccord, far more than the majority of AEU pilots. So it's unfortunate that the time which Eli planned the protest effort, I simply could not come to work. When I had already started out to put up the Beacon, I had no knowledge, whatsoever, that the protest was ongoing as Eli didn't post anything to other aEU pilots. I frequently mute the General channel too so if he announced it there, then he lef
01:01:29 t out the rest of us but still, i wasn't at work so I wouldn't have heard anything and known. Had I done nothing up to that point to work towards Outccord, I would consider what Ather claimed to be justified but it's clear he did this for spite without any consideration for what I have already accomplished towards this end.
Thank you Nissi
Kind regards,
Lily Kaise

01:02:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

01:02:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Maybe I seem as though I'm using our message area to vent. It's not that. I just want to be transparent with you all."

01:03:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I felt that I had to defend SEAS and I could have on the General board but I didn't want to start a back and forth war with Morris."

01:03:59 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I understand."

01:04:01 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:04:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

01:04:13 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

01:05:00 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws creeps across the bottom of the tank, snapping its many claws rapidly.

01:05:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at you thoughtfully.

01:05:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok you don't have to answer. I just wondered."

01:06:38 You say, "I think it was fine. She posted to you on the General board so nnaturally you responded directly to her."

01:06:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."

01:07:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But again I just didn't feel it was the bes place to be as blunt as I was an dperhaps I should have sugar-coated more haha but Nissi isn't one for stuff like that."

01:15:51 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:19:06 Lily says to you, "I had to work on the Warehouse a bit more. It wasn't apparent that I had to add us all, including myself. So I had to demote you as Acting Founder, add myself as Trustee with Full Rights and the rest of you so then I promoted you again. That was weird as it would seem that the Warehouse would have this information per the existing Organization and then you just modify what's in place."

01:19:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But sinde I wasn't in the list, I couldn't do much until I had my Founder status again haha."

01:19:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:19:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Wow I was like what the hell!"

01:21:00 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

01:21:10 You say, "Glad you got it figuredout."

01:26:00 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on your leg, then rubs its head against you, purring softly.

01:34:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well this is why our names are at the bottom of the access list."

01:34:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:38:29 You laugh.

01:39:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I even gave Tara full access. I doubt she will cause any problems and she hasn't yet expressed much interest in station building but I know she would be good at it."

01:48:52 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:48:58 You say, "Yeah, she would."

02:19:01 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

02:19:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow I'm amazed we're not being beheaded for our opposition but still, this is not how you deal with differences."

02:19:21 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

02:19:23 You exclaim, "Oh wow!"

02:19:30 You exclaim, "That's... just terrible!"

02:19:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I so wish anybody who supports Best these days were just sent to some other Planet to occupy but I don't wish death nor dismemberment nor injury to anyone."

02:20:04 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:20:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am just so... I just can't express how I feel."

02:21:28 You say, "I know."

02:21:30 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:21:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:21:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident leans on you.

02:21:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is just not right."

02:22:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There are obviously some really violent factions out there and they don't even represent us."

02:23:37 You say, "There sure are. Unfortunately, humanity's history is replete with extremely vilent factions."

02:23:50 You say, "Violent."

02:23:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah and I so just can't understand that."

02:24:01 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

02:24:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a news application.

02:24:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

02:24:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident frowns.

02:24:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What the fuck does he mean by peace-keeping."

02:24:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:24:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh what the hell does he know about peace-keeping."

02:25:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So yeah pull my license for that."

02:25:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:27:58 You stroke the soft fur of Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo.

02:27:58 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

02:28:04 You're already sitting.

02:28:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

02:28:15 I don't see that here.

02:29:05 "Lip," hmm?  Well, better luck next time.

02:29:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I jsut can't believe I accidentally eliminate my speckled breed."

02:29:17 You say, "Aww."

02:29:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure glad I have enjoyed a few pets from it."

Given the latest news headline I am going to have to decline this artifacting trip for the time being. This is the second headline about violence in a few days. While I am fully aware that these issues will have to primarily be dealt with by the AEU, something may come up that would require others assistance. I apologize for any inconvenience this causes anyone but feel it's the right decision for me at this time. For those who go, enjoy and have a prosperous trip. I just feel that the waters are growing more turbulent here at home and cannot, in good conscience, make the trip.

02:31:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That sounds insensitive and I sure don't mean it that way."

02:32:01 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

02:32:01 I don't see that here.

02:32:13 I don't see that here.

02:32:17 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:32:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll reserve o my decision as there are some days which will elapse prior to the 22nd but if it seems we'll need to decline, of course we will."

02:32:53 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:33:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Melinda, as per usual just doesn't want us participating and so she bases her opinons on her personal agenda."

02:33:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Opinions."

02:33:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We will, however certainly do the responsible thing."

02:34:05 You nod and grin.

02:34:06 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Is the watchtower in 285 powered by debris?"

02:34:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No."

02:34:29 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That would be very awkward."

02:34:35 [General Communication] James Donovan transmits, "It has about 3 days of battery power remaining."

02:34:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Right now, pretty ^u^h only reason to go out there is for {"ids."

02:34:42 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I know."

02:34:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So they really have fucked up 777. Someone built one of the stations with a Fission Reactor and that won't last very long."

02:34:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:35:01 You exclaim, "Wow!"

02:35:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Look at the temp station list then they used Fringe cores."

02:35:51 You nod.

02:36:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh Evenia the genious station builder."

02:36:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Seriously, she tries but she needs a lot of hand-holding."

02:37:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Whenever I had her put up the Asteroid Processor, I had to have it already set up on lifters for her in a separate ship."

02:37:18 You nod.

02:38:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Those Fission Breeder Reacters are powerful but their life is short and so it's not a good idea to use them unless you need that much power."

02:39:01 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

02:39:19 You say, "YEah, she should know that."

02:39:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They cost ten megacredits versus a Large Precharged Battery which costs 8 and typically lasts longer if you don't exceed the power requirement."

02:39:36 You nod.

02:40:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok going to New Earth for a few."

02:40:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:40:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:41:00 Lily says to you, "Are you ok to go along?"

02:41:01 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

02:41:09 You grin. "Ok."

02:41:12 You smile.

02:41:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:41:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:41:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:41:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

02:41:28 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Ather, we pilots of the League made your pilots decision for them. So now they can pretend they did it."

02:41:28 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:41:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:41:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:41:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:41:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:41:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:41:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:41:41 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa chortles.

02:41:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:41:42 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:41:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:41:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:41:45 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

02:41:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:41:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:41:48 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:41:50 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

02:41:51 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:41:56 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "League t) the rescu-."

02:42:10 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lily will probably more than likely end up complaining more about the artifacting trip getting canceled, instead if you all are going to do all that."

02:42:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No shit now you're admitting it Melinda."

02:42:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:42:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh I haven't complained about anything."

02:42:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:42:28 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It'll be pretty sad if we all drop out and seas are the only people to go."

02:42:38 You laugh.

02:42:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm about to post to the org even."

02:42:53 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:42:53 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:42:58 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "While I like Shule and Constantine, we'd be better off if Lily went, probably."

02:42:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:42:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

Due to the AEU situation, lots of people are dropping out just in case.
rather than going with a limited crew, the trip will be postponed until the situation is stable.
Everyone who has spots on the trip will have them reserved, should you wish to go at that time.

thanks,
Johann Schraft

02:51:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ather."

02:51:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:51:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

Thank you Johann.
I'm glad you chose to do this.
I would have had to stay behind even if you'd decided to continue the trip.
This is just the wrong time to go away.
But we'll go eventually, and the artifacts will still be there.
To the AEU people, keep the faith, an" we're all behind you one hundred percent.
Evenia.

Thank you Johann, contrary to the nay-sayers out there, I had already posted a Comm message to SEAS requesting that they stand by as we would drop out based upon the need to serve our AEU citizens. Sorry to disappoint your assumptions Melinda as well but I do certainly consider our responsibilities over an artifacting trip. Thank you Johann for holding our spots on the crew list and we will see how circumstances are at the time when the rescheduled trip occurs.

03:00:35 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "My question is, since I'm sure she is tuned into gen comms based on her reaction, is why didn't you post your withdrawal on the board before Johann posted the cancellation of the trip? Lots of other people did, after all!"

03:00:56 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Exploration.

03:01:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There I had to come back at her. This is jsut rediculous."

03:22:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:22:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:22:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And could those voicemails have been sent as letters?"

03:22:29 Lily says to a gold-toned engineering tool case, "Get your mail so we don't have to come back? I guess I could have handed it to you."

03:22:39 You say, "Hang on."

03:22:40 You scramble to your feet.

03:22:40 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo slides to the floor.
[Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

03:22:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No idea. But I'm sure grateful when I ain't gotta write to somebody and can just tell their phone instead."

03:22:47 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a fine piece of paper with an official header reading "From the founder of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars". You quickly grab it off the belt.

03:22:58 --

03:22:58 Hellow SEAS, based upon the most recent News reports as of 9-18-2317, we will be observing developments over the next few days. Contrary to the nay-sayers of Melinda Michaels and others, I certainly will not go forward to participate in the upcoming Artifacting trip particularly we may need to be available to defend our fellow citizens. So please be vigilent and of course there will be other Exploration and Artifacting trips in the future.
To add to this, Johann has postponed the trip and this comes as a great relief as I wouldn't want for you all to have prepared to go and then have to change plans at the last minute. As you can see, there are some really childish pilots out there and I don't think I need to name other names! There will certainly be more trips in the future and i'm not as uncaring about our citizens as some would like to fabricate based soley upon Ather's recent tantrum.
So stay tuned to your News Reader, the Message Boards and any other resources.
Above all, be ready to defend our aEU citizens and all other humanity.
Lily Kaise

03:23:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, what else are pilots gonna spend their billions on?"

03:23:07 You put a fine piece of paper with an official header reading "From the founder of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars" in a leather briefcase.

03:23:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok.. If it's really that bad I may need a minute to open my eyes first and get my brain right before reading this.. thanks for the heads up I think?"

03:23:16 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo here.

03:23:39 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I passed on voicemail simply because it's too expensive, passed on the holovid too since I have a handheld one. Besides, can't call SSN and use your phone holovid at the same time."

03:23:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He has no idea what I was doing."

03:23:59 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "My entire plan without it is 35."

03:24:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "My rent's twice that."

03:24:06 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No matter how bad you think it is, it's worse."

03:24:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "For your rent you're getting a physical space though."

03:24:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He so wants me to respond and I won't."

03:24:13 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Yeah, Eli, get acoffee, finish it, make sure you are sitting, then read."

03:24:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:24:34 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Don't try and read while drinking, you'll likely just spew it all over the place."

03:24:34 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know it would cost me 20,000,000 AEOS credits to get a plan on new earth. Meh. Can't really afford that right now. So I'll wait."

03:24:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So? I don't even hardly sleep there."

03:24:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:24:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think I need to turn general back off."

03:25:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:25:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

03:25:03 You say, "Me too."

03:25:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

03:25:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:25:10 You scramble to your feet.

03:25:16 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:25:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:25:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You see they want me to engage them and I absolutely refuse to."

03:26:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Before Melinda posted her message about withdrawing, no matter how sarcastic she was being, I was planning to send out that comm notice to you all."

03:26:53 You say, "I know my love."

03:26:57 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:26:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just ahd to regain my composure after seeing that news."

03:27:15 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:27:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Bue I did respond because I knew they had to know regardless."

03:27:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But."

03:27:46 You nod.

03:28:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's ok Morris will certainly hang himself. It's just a matter of time."

03:29:23 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

03:29:25 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:29:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I can tell you why Melinda is behaving like a 3-year-old, she feels guilty and very insecure about her actions."

03:30:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure will be interesting when Nissi gets my letter which has a direct reproduciton of Melinda's letter to me. If nissi wants to see the letter, I have it."

03:37:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh you know I wasn't looking any less forward to this trip than others so not sure what their big deal is."

03:38:35 You say, "I have no idea what it is."

03:38:39 You say, "Heh."

03:38:46 You say, "They just like drama."

03:39:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:39:54 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

03:40:05 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

03:43:37 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:44:05 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

03:45:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

03:45:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:45:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident examines a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

03:45:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident makes a selection on a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of white paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into her waiting hand.

03:46:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:46:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives you a sheet of white paper.

03:46:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Heh should I send that to Johann?"

03:48:05 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo suddenly jumps onto a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top.

03:49:57 --

03:49:57 Johann,
Thank you for taking so much care to postpone the Artifacting trip. Just after I read the headlines, I was already drafting a comm notice to SEAS as there is absolutely no way that we would have joined the trip given what may evolve.
It's amazing though as I know that I'm no less disappointed that the trip won't happen at this time than others Still, it won't likely to be the last trip of this nature and as I expressed to SEAS, being here for AEU citizens is of more importance. I'm sure that the drama queens just wanted something to cure their own childish boredom and to lashout at some target for their own disappointment. It's sad for them indeed but I certainly know what we must do.
Kind regards,
Lily Kaise

03:50:22 You say, "Sure, if you want to."

03:50:26 You chuckle.

03:50:31 I see no "pepr".

03:50:36 You give a sheet of white paper to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:50:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well do you think I went overboard or said anything wrong?"

03:50:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:51:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "You say su re but do you agree or disagree?"

03:51:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure that is."

03:52:07 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Well, if it were me, I wouldn't have said anything about the darma queens, but that's just me."

03:52:23 You say, "Drama."

03:52:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well what should I say? I mean."

03:52:28 You say, "Bleh, I can't talk."

03:53:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Think watering it down just gives them more substance if you know what I mean?"

03:53:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I could just say some? Or what could I substitute."

03:54:15 You say, "Bleh, I can't talk."

03:54:54 You say, "I would have just left that part about them off, but like I said, that's just me. I would have thanked him for postponing it and all of that."

03:55:05 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:55:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok i'll water it down."

03:56:05 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

03:56:41 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:57:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives you a sheet of white paper.

03:57:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok here's the watered down version."

03:58:27 --

03:58:28 Johann,

03:58:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was trying to say that I know others are equally disappointed but for some reason they're thinking I'm in some overdrive heh. I was actually hping it wouldn't go forward this weekend coming anyway."

03:59:10 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:59:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It just buys us more time that perhaps things will come to some conclusion."

03:59:15 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:59:18 You say, "Yeah."

03:59:23 You give a sheet of white paper to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:59:25 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

03:59:29 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

03:59:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Ok read this version please?"

03:59:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Is it ok?"

04:00:24 Lily looks around very confusedly.

04:00:48 You say, "I did. Sounds great."

04:00:53 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:01:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident scrambles to her feet.

04:01:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

04:01:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:01:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

04:01:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

04:01:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:01:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:01:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:01:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:01:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:01:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:02:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:02:08 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:02:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:02:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:02:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:02:15 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Angel Voices" has launched from New Earth.

04:02:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:02:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:02:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:02:19 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:02:20 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:02:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:02:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:02:24 There appear to be 16 pilots recently active.

04:02:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:02:26 There appear to be 16 pilots recently active.

04:02:27 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:02:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:02:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:02:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:03:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:03:45 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:03:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:03:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:04:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:04:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

04:04:02 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:04:05 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:04:07 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:04:10 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

04:04:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:04:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes all last fall based entirely upon Melinda Michael's lies."

04:05:03 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:05:05 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a shark, then loses interest and jets off.

04:05:06 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

04:05:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's always the one who can make the most noise and clamor until they get caught out."

04:05:40 You say, "True."

04:06:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:06:33 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:06:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey everybody."

04:07:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Read headlines."

04:07:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:07:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Constantine, read everything you can."

04:07:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Fuck."

04:07:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:07:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No trip for awhile for very serious reasons."

04:09:06 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

04:12:05 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, purring softly.

04:12:17 You say to Lily, "Ready to go lie down?"

04:13:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, caught up."

04:14:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What is this stuff about people assuming we were still going to go? Did anyone actually say that?"

04:14:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Melinda's post didn't really say that."

04:14:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah. That's what I said too."

04:14:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:14:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah they were going nuts on the General channel. They just wanted their drama."

04:15:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:15:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And you know about this issue from last Fall but Morris is just a mean type who believed Melinda's lies."

04:16:06 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

04:16:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's pretty bad."

04:16:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:16:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know what my intentions were and I know what they weren't so it's jsut that those who have what presume to be powerful can say to influence others their way."

04:17:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "It is most certainly that."

04:17:06 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.

04:17:40 "Ready to go lie down?" You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:17:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:17:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Anyway, I'm glad Johann postponed the trip. I actually was hoping it wouldn't be this soon but given the circumstances, I'm not happy that this is what postponed the trip because this is just horrible and we do have to be here."

04:18:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd like to know what's going through best's head. Why organize a Taskforce? What does he hope to accomplish here?"

04:18:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I think I wasn't going to go anyway, but at least maybe I'll have to opportunity to go later."

04:18:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh nothing I'm sure but a lot more needs to take place which should have occurred months ago."

04:18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think he means to institute martial law on every planet but New Earth."

04:18:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That's how I'm reading it. That might not be his express intention, but that's going to the result, starting with Hyperion."

04:19:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob snorts in disbelief. Yeah, that's totally gonna work. Sure.

04:19:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This is insane, and no probably not all the worlds, I would bet just the Cheyenne's Star ones."

04:19:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe the Riverway colonies too? I can't remember where Aenea is."

04:20:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:20:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Very scarey stuff and it has more implications i'm sure."

04:20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Aenea is in the Cheyanne cluster."

04:21:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, why a task force for troubled world's? Why not just send support or extra personnel to Hyperion's law enforcement? This is some crazy stuff to wake up to, I'm glad I waited a bit before reading it."

04:21:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's all insanity, Eli."

04:22:06 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

04:22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think he must not trust the locals to deal with it. He must feel personally threatened, since his own party is being targeted."

04:22:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:22:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, that's how I interpret it."

04:22:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Also this way he can control the judicial response."

04:22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I assume."

04:22:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's a terrible thing to have happened. Something like it was bound to happen eventually with the way the Patriots have been doing folks though, just surprised it went that far."

04:23:02 You glance at your communicator's screen.

04:23:02 Notice from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Hellow SEAS, based upon the most recent News reports as of 9-18-2317, we will be observing developments over the next few days. Contrary to the nay-sayers of Melinda and others, I certainly will not go forward to participate in the upcoming Artifacting trip particularly when we may need to be available to defend our fellow citizens. So please be vigilent and of course there will be other trips in the future. [00:47 18 September 2317 GST]
You have one mail message.

04:23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd be willing to bet he doesn't even give two shits that we're striking. Or if he does, he's not doing a lot about it. I dunno."

04:23:27 You say, "Be right back."

04:23:29 You scramble to your feet.

04:23:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

04:23:30 You exit the ship.

04:23:30 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

04:23:32 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

04:23:32 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:23:33 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

04:23:33 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a letter here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

04:23:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:23:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:23:35 I don't understand that.

04:23:38 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:23:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I just can't fathom fiolence of any form though."

04:23:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:23:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The office won't even tell me whether the government has asked them to try ending the strike."

04:23:50 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Shangri-la Terraform Group 994" has launched from The Torus (Dock Delta).

04:23:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:50:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I do wonder why i'm more spoiled than they are?"

04:51:25 You laugh. "I don't care what they think."

04:52:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I probably do more for others than they would ever. I've given Melinda billions to bail her out when she cracked up two of her ships and others."

04:52:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "How easily they forget."

04:53:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I probably won't now because they are likely to use their ships against us at some point."

04:54:45 You say, "Yeah, people will remember what they want to. Obviously, they don't want to because then they wouldn't be able to justify their negative attitudes."

04:55:13 You say, "And I sure hope Morris tries. I'd love to pop his ship."

04:55:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I don't see any rats in the belt itself. Strange."

04:56:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah they do leave after awhile."

04:56:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah they might have. Just my luck, too."

04:56:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Let Melinda know it's clear, then."

04:59:06 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

04:59:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I sure wish I could go with Constantine and Dakhal to Hyperion even if Im not from there."

04:59:26 You say to Lily, "Well, I'd better try to get some sleep. I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

04:59:46 You say, "Yeah, I'll see if I can make it."

04:59:48 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. Rest well and sweet dreams. I love you."

05:00:08 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

05:00:10 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

05:01:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

05:04:31 [Tactical Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Spinward is clear of rats for the present."

05:04:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:04:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily cheers for Jacob!

05:05:08 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

05:05:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Only got two turrets damaged too. 1 was at 40, 2 was at 18. Should've moved a bit more."

05:06:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:06:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Or just ran and repaired and then gone back for them."

05:06:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You can't really dodge drills, but you can try to limit your exposive to the pack if you can. I like to kind of back away from large groups while picking them off."

05:06:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, that works too."

05:06:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That way I'm not getting drilled into from several directions."

05:07:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:07:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Rats are pretty slow-moving so I'd just run to the other end of the sector or just out of the sector and repair and then go back."

05:07:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Exposure, I meant."

05:07:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Those drills are painful lil bitches."

05:07:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah what Constantine says too."

05:07:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah they are."

05:08:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll definitely remember that next time I go hunting for them. They're easy kills, so I figure why not?"

05:08:53 Minor Change: As implied by a previous headline, AEU pilots may now undertake peacekeeping patrols to keep the streets safe.

05:09:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, and they're getting to be a problem in some parts of space."

05:09:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Never let them go if you can help it."

05:09:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Indeed. I'd hate to come across a reaper in my fighter."

05:10:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You can get them, but yeah, they're nothing to sneeze at. If you want to go after them I'd wait until you have some hull and weapon upgrades."

05:10:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, that's true."

05:11:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And with that being said, I think I'm gonna try to get another nap in. I really don't like sleeping this much, but what else can ya do?"

05:11:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The striking life."

05:11:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Sleep well."

05:11:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll do my best, good sir."

05:13:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:13:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah stay away from Reapers as they are pretty wicked and not worth any heroics."

05:34:58 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Bolt thrower and opochtli pirates in belt of Orion fighting with peacekeepers."

05:35:16 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "And interdictors."

05:35:48 [Tactical Communication] Pilot James Donovan transmits, "Anyone crewing up to go help, or just leaving it to peacekeepers?"

05:36:01 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'm there in a fighter."

05:36:19 [Tactical Communication] Pilot James Donovan transmits, "I assume your stuck then if they have interdictors?"

05:36:34 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Correct."

05:36:42 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Last interdictor is about to fall."

05:38:53 [Tactical Communication] Pilot James Donovan transmits, "So, what's our status in orion?"

06:16:11 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

06:49:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

07:06:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

07:07:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli."

07:09:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey..."

07:09:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going?"

07:10:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "As well as can be expected, I suppose. Came to the lounge for a few but you were pretty lost in though."

07:10:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, sorry about that."

07:10:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. in thought."

07:10:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No need to say sorry, was just commenting on it."

07:12:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I probably wouldn't be very good company anways, I'm still a bit stunned."

07:13:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Where'd you get that shirt, by the way?"

07:13:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, this old thing?"

07:13:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone chuckles.

07:13:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They have a rack full of alliance shirts. You can get EAOS and Accord stuff there, too."

07:13:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Huh, guess I never noticed."

07:22:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No work to do and no transports to run off."

07:23:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I got one a bit ago over Hoyt."

07:26:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Way to not read the room, Best. I don't know if any of us would risk our lives to protect NaPas."

07:26:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, a bit of chatter over general earlier about it."

07:26:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I've heard nothing about this through the terminal, of course."

07:26:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll let everyone know if I do."

07:28:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And Morris said he wondered if they would be paying us for that."

07:29:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wouldn't take much stock in that. A Leager and a Mutuality pilot aren't going to know anything about this."

07:29:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, you might be right."

07:30:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wouldn't make much sense. Not sure what pilots are supposed to do about someone behing beheaded in their homes. It's not like she lived in a starship."

07:31:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, if they do though, they're in for what shouldn't be a surprise. I can't imagine any of us being on board with turning into world police."

07:32:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."

07:32:18 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

07:43:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that happens a good bit, actually."

07:43:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You will sometimes get a bunch of acadets and they just go off and we never hear from 'em again."

07:44:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figure the attrition rate must be pretty high around here."

07:44:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Especially with what's been going on."

07:44:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's always been like that though, for some reaso."

07:44:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. reason."

07:45:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I suppose it's sort of a different lifestyle."

07:45:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe a lot of people don't really realize the implications until they get here."

08:06:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

08:07:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks heavily and then dozes off.

10:12:23 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

13:20:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:20:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:20:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:20:46 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:20:46 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:20:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

13:20:50 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

13:20:52 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

13:20:53 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

13:20:54 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.

13:34:26 Lily. I don't have a problem with Seas coming along at all. I can't speak for everyone, but I hope that everyone going can at least be curteous while confined in a small area. Hopefully us all being in the same place will help everyone settle things down, although I do know that Evenia is still quite upset by some of your accusations, and an effort to positively communicate would go a long way towards mitigating that.

I appreciate your offer to provide stations, but we are actually already stocked up on stuff and the stuff we need is the stuff I need to get from cats. Since the only station that's providing money is the repair station, and probably only a few hundred thousand credits at most, no org will be missing out on much if any.

As a side note, I am sorry you took my tone about stations going down as me being upset. Generally when I ask about stations it's generally just me making sure people are aware it's down or almost down, and if they're not able to put it up what I need to do to help out. The only times I can picture being abrupt is if there's a pilot trapped somewhere, but that's more I want them to get home safely as soon as they can.

Also, clarification, if the four of you are going, you're bringing the scout? Or are you bringing the siteseer regardless?
thanks,
Johann Schraft

17:30:57 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

17:30:57 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

17:30:58 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

17:30:58 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:31:06 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:31:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:31:07 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:31:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

17:31:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:31:22 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:31:22 Which sector did you mean?

17:31:23 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

17:31:23 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:31:23 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:31:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

17:31:27 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:31:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:31:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:31:31 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:31:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

17:31:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:31:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:31:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:31:36 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

17:31:39 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

17:32:39 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:32:40 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

17:32:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

17:32:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:32:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:32:59 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

17:37:41 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:37:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:38:13 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:01:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Ugh. This Drama between the organizations is pissing me off. This is exactly the kind of thing Best wants to happen. Ather doesn't even realize it."

20:01:53 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, I know. It's really making me mad too."

20:02:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

20:02:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Tara. Hi Constantine."

20:03:21 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Hi."

20:03:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How's it going?"

20:03:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Just waking up."

20:06:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm hoping no one helps the task force. I'm surprised Best even gave us that opportunity."

20:07:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Read the room, buddy."

20:07:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Not going to, but things like what happened on Hyperion are entirely wrong, and fucked up."

20:08:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I agree, but we're not police. They have law enforcement to deal with this."

20:08:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Bringing in the military and using us as some kind of brute squad isn't the answer."

20:08:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least, I don't think so."

20:10:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Besides, I think Best is only giving us the chance so that the news can print stories about patriotic pilots punching unreg sympethizing orphans in the face, or something."

20:10:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just for propaganda purposes."

20:20:15 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Three for a beacon?"

20:20:42 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Sure."

20:20:46 [Tactical Communication] Sarah Bellamy transmits, "Me."

20:20:55 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I'd gladly go, but I'm headed back and 30 sectors out. Do you have time to wait?"

20:20:56 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "One more?"

20:21:02 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Yes."

20:21:14 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "All done."

20:21:17 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Alright,, thanks bunches."

20:25:35 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

20:28:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Constantine, that officer isn't going to sign me up instantly if I talk to him, right?"

20:28:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I talked to him briefly, he asked if I would or wouldn't help. Figuring that as soon as I said yes, there would be a headline about my agreeing to punch dissidents in the face, I said no."

20:29:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure if agreeing signs you up instantly."

20:30:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm I better go talk to him wearing my Accord flightsuit."

20:31:20 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Damien I'm sorry I misread my mileage thing I'm father out than I thought. Please don't wait for me."

20:31:38 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "All right. Luck out there."

20:31:51 [Tactical Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "One for a beacon?"

20:32:18 [MTTS] Ulias: Heh, I don't know what you guys are up to, but I'm super intrigued.

20:34:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm I don't see him anywhere constantine."

20:34:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He should be in the security office. Wearing a navy uniform."

20:34:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh the security office."

20:37:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This is insane, how are starships supposed to help with someone being murdered in their home."

20:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Best is just using hte execution of one of his own party to further his own agenda, disgusting."

20:38:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "My best guess is he just wants the propaganda value of having us patrolling the streets."

20:38:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Patrolling the streets though? I mean we're pilots, what the hell?"

20:39:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Anyone interested in decapitating NaPas can just do it where we're not allowed to be anyway."

20:39:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ery true."

20:39:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I don't see how we're going to stop anything."

20:39:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, we're not supposed to, he's basically signing us up for some kind of militia."

20:40:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not sure how it would be portrayed so I'm not gonna do it, but I'm tempted to just say yes and see what they want us to do."

20:40:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I was tempted to do the same. I guarantee if I had a headline would have quickly followed though."

20:41:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh yeah, for sure."

20:41:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Instead of it saying "Area pilot asks question" it would say "Brave Loyalist constantine Stone vows to keep the peace in Best's specialized task force" or some shit."

20:41:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Eli.."

20:41:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Exactly."

20:42:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heya Tara, I'm headed right back there, just grabbing some food."

20:42:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'll say yes, how about that? They already think im some loyalist as it is, joining up might make your whole campaign harder."

20:42:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd prefer it if we froze him out entirely, but I can't stop you."

20:43:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, it might make you look pretty bad if you do, but yeah we can't stop you."

20:43:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, I'd wait a little bit.. I'm gonna look into a couple of things, there might be others who are asking for your help elsewhere."

20:44:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the first thing I tried to see is if there was a guy on each planet."

20:44:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you do that though, We'll all do our best to make folks understand if they get all judgey heh. I would recommend not doing it though."

20:44:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I didn't find any anywhere else."

20:44:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's possible that he'll just explain what the deal is and give you a cahnce to back out."

20:44:35 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

20:45:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah he's going to make our refusal look bad, too."

20:45:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's the headline, I knew that was coming."

20:45:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But make no mistake, this isn't going to assist anyone."

20:45:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Local law enforcement should be dealing with this."

20:45:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not military."

20:45:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, agreed."

20:55:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You should be the one to do it, Eli. No one will believe you did a 180."

20:55:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Even if they try to say that in the news."

20:55:48 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Beacons?"

20:55:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm that's a very good point."

20:55:56 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "OK."

20:56:10 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Anybody else?"

20:57:45 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "One more for beacons?"

20:57:52 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I would love to if I wasn't so far away."

20:58:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er. Will know better."

20:58:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Gen er. Will know better."

21:11:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'll be here for a while yet. But i've got to start working again soon."

21:24:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I really hope Ihaven't screwed something up."

21:24:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So what did he say?"

21:24:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn' tthink he'd be like " Ok yeah, you'r ein." I certainly thought he'd give me a cahnce to back out or something."

21:24:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well honestly guys.. I'ts worse than we thought."

21:25:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hold up, let me check one thing and I"ll fill you in."

21:26:36 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:26:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When I said I was interested, he said he would have my battlesuit fitted with the proper sensors right away."

21:26:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, geez."

21:27:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Patrolling our streets in suits?"

21:27:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's.. that's going to make people scared. Very scared."

21:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, this is sick. And battlesuits can actually kill someone. We're not talking stun weapons here."

21:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He doesn't expect you to use suit weapons on civilians?"

21:28:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It doesn't matter, Con. Its the fact the suits are seen."

21:28:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I mean I think he must expect that."

21:29:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You know, he might have just handed us something."

21:29:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe you should do a broadcast about this."

21:29:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Perhaps."

21:31:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I got an idea!"

21:31:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What are you thinking?"

21:31:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Probably not a good one, but an idea."

21:32:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you want to do a broadcast, Eli, maybe you can include footage of a tier 5 fringe suit or something."

21:32:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh."

21:32:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And be like look what he wants to have walking down our streets."

21:34:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think people definitely need to know about this. I doubt even the NaPas agree with this 100%."

21:34:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did I miss Tara's idea?"

21:35:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think so."

21:35:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "A jolly parade of syrup suits?"

21:36:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, now when I talk to him he asks me if I'm ready for a mission.. good lord."

21:36:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What if we turned this patrol thing around and used AEU suit's repair abilities to -help- civilians. I mean, best might take advantage of it, but theres a lot of places that still need repairs! Like I said, probably not a good idea, but still an idea."

21:36:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wha?"

21:36:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ha! Not sure that would work, but I like that."

21:36:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's an interesting idea."

21:37:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure the microdrones are good for fixing anything but suits, though."

21:37:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They aren't, I don't think."

21:37:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "To catch you up Evangeline, Best wants us running patrols on Union planets in our battlesuits."

21:37:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Seriously? Why?"

21:37:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That would be awesome though. Yeah sure I'll go oppress these citizens, and then just start fixing up their houses."

21:37:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's rediculous..."

21:37:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think he's hoping we'll keep the peace."

21:37:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Headlines Eva. Things are getting hot."

21:37:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't htink suits can fix..."

21:37:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Anything but other suits."

21:38:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "At the very least a battle suit can carry a lot of supplies or work tools that civilain workers couldnt."

21:38:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I agree Eva, but it's still a cool idea."

21:38:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It would be funny if it worked."

21:38:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes, but do you really want to..."

21:38:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes yes, but do you really want to do what Best says?"

21:39:00 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:39:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

21:39:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know I talked to him about it so that no one else would have to. He signed me up but I'm not going to actually accept a mission."

21:39:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Really?"

21:39:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I'm rather hesitant to go one one of these peacekeeping patrols."

21:39:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Tried to tell him to hold his horses, but he just signed me right up after I said I was interested in what he had to say."

21:39:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "... Yeah..."

21:40:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm glad I didn't talk to him, then."

21:40:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I probably would have had some choice words, if I could even get them out of my mouth."

21:40:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Fortunate that I doubt anyone is going to do this. We've had what, two people killed in as many weeks? If the separatists see battlesuits walking around..."

21:40:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, they're going to move on from amateur status and take things up a notch."

21:40:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wasn't going to talk to him at all, but I didn't want curiosity getting the better of folks."

21:40:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I read about that hyperion woman who was beheaded in her home."

21:41:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Best coul dhave easily prevented that."

21:41:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. Best could have easily prevented that."

21:41:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes, I know."

21:42:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He could have entered into talks with the sepratists, instead of charging the senators who suggested it with terrorism."

21:42:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So what do you want to do?"

21:42:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm sitting in my transport itching to salvage or something to be honest."

21:42:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I forgot how to salvage."

21:42:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, no I didn't say you were aruging."

21:42:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Angles? What are those."

21:43:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok.. hehe."

21:43:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, right?"

21:43:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We've been doing no work at all and our muscle memory is shot."

21:43:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What is this salvaging you speak of."

21:43:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We only try to salvage the Union."

21:43:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But our angle seems quite wrong."

21:43:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yup, it does."

21:43:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Basically my idea was to turn best's intentions on its head. This is clearly a tactic to create fear and distrust in pilots, I believe."

21:44:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, but how are we going to turn his intentions on their head if he's already halfway standing on it?"

21:45:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And did you talk to Best in person, Eli?"

21:45:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Huh? No no."

21:45:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh."

21:45:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's a naval officer in the security center."

21:45:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh lord."

21:46:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Do you think I should talk to him?"

21:46:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have an idea."

21:46:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think the fewer of us who get our suits fitted with whatever kind of civilian-tracking sensors."

21:46:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The better."

21:46:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably not. He gives you a yes or no question, if you say yes he signs you up. But it looks like you have to actually accept a mission after that so as long as you don't do that yo'ure fine."

21:46:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What's that?"

21:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "... Yeah but if we have sensors tracking us..."

21:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "At least I would think, but honestly I wouldn't even sign up in the first place. I'm quite irritated that I got signed up."

21:47:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I just wanted to hear him out."

21:47:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well... it's best not to feed into it then."

21:47:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm considering signing up for a patrol, just to see what it's like, but purposefully get my battlesuit blown up. It'd hurt the conquest goals too."

21:47:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, he apparently doesn't care one way or the other."

21:48:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm.. I don't know. I really think even a whiff of these machines on our streets is going to stir up more trouble."

21:48:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just read the com notice, Not gonna do it."

21:48:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Besides, we're striking. If he wants us working there are things he needs to do first."

21:49:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I mean not gonna go up to that guy."

21:49:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I hear ya."

21:49:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I know he wants us to work, but blowing up a battlesuit hurts conquest goals a lot!"

21:49:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Especially a tier 5."

21:50:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm very curious what these missions could be though. It apparently involves some kind of scanner. This makes it sounds like things are already going down that we jus tdon't know about."

21:50:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that's true. But accepting the job is agreeing to work, and accepting the job will mean battlesuits on the street."

21:50:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I wondered about that too, Eli."

21:50:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "... You are curious about the mission yet you don't want to do it? I'm confused."

21:50:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which will scare people, and I think escalate this situation."

21:50:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Are you signed up too Tara?"

21:50:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "No, I haven't signed up."

21:50:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What I mean is. If they're deploying battlesuits, and they're all set for it, then what are they deploying against?"

21:50:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No I get that. I'd love to know exactly what they want us doing, but I think putting battlesuits on the street is a bad idea."

21:51:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's rather hard to move around in the armor."

21:51:50 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I want to see what the mission is like. Just curious, but doing it in a way that will hurt conquest goals and our productivity. It won't help him at all if I get a tier 5 suti blown up. Our productivity will be worse than if I don't do anything."

21:52:02 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I can't stop you."

21:52:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Be careful."

21:54:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Shule, if you can, figure out what the guy means by scanning. Eli said his battlesuit got upgraded with a special sensor system."

21:55:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "?Yeah, the security guy told me the same thing. That mine got upgraded with a scanner."

21:56:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wish I had known someone was goign to do that. That's why I talked ot the guy so no one else would have to."

21:56:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I talked to the guy too for the same reason."

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

21:57:39 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

21:58:43 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:58:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:58:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:58:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:58:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:59:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:59:04 Which sector did you mean?

21:59:04 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

21:59:05 The ship is already in that sector.

21:59:09 Would you like to request docking clearance for The Torus (Dock Alpha)?

21:59:10 [Enter `yes' or `no']

21:59:11 You notify flight control of your desire to dock.

21:59:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:59:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:59:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh good point."

21:59:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:59:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't go in with weapons."

21:59:32 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:59:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you can help it."

21:59:36 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:59:36 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:59:38 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

21:59:39 You can go out and enter into the ship.

You can go up and out.

21:59:49 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:59:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:59:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:59:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:59:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:00:04 The ship is already moving.

22:00:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:00:05 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:00:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:00:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:00:08 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:00:10 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:00:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:00:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:00:17 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:00:18 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:00:19 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:00:20 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

22:00:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:00:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:00:22 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:00:26 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Fearless! Welcome to home space!"

22:00:27 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:00:35 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 442" has launched from New Earth.

22:00:44 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Leave the sector for your own safety."

22:00:44 Via general sector communication, Registered Merchant 442 transmits a text-based transmission: "If you say so."
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 442" has jumped out of the sector.

22:00:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:00:49 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:00:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:00:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:01:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:01:10 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

22:29:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like I should point out that they're likely hoping one of us will be curious and do one."

22:30:01 You say to Lily, "I'm planning on going on a mission, just to get my battle suit blown up."

22:30:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:30:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think it benefits us in any way to do one, but who knows."

22:30:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And it could certainly make us look really bad."

22:30:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't really either Constantine, but at least he's going in without weapons."

22:30:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:30:30 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:30:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

22:31:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident scrambles to her feet.

22:31:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

22:31:04 I don't see "lily" here.

22:31:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:33:38 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

22:35:58 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

22:36:17 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

22:36:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

22:36:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

22:37:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "To be honest I'm not sure signing up for work then failing on purpose sends the right message. In my opinion, the strike should mean they get none of our time at all."

22:37:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah agree Constantine. T least though we'll get info on what the missions actually are I guess."

22:37:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We don't want them thinking there's no reason to end the strike since we're incompetent to do the job anyway."

22:39:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:39:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I see your point Constantine but we ought to at least see what we're tasked to do."

22:39:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I agree. I just don't know that we should be encouraging people to sign up and blow their suits up en masse."

22:39:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like if we want to waste resources there are ways to do that without taking on these missions."

22:40:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:40:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well you guys have already done a fair amount of that."

22:41:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, and it appears to have had little to no effect. No reason to give them the headline fodder that tons of us are signing up for the task force while also accomplishing nothing."

22:41:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:41:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have discouraged the work but I will not hold others accountable. It's their choice."

22:41:38 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

22:41:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

22:41:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:42:27 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

22:42:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident runs a small silver genetic tester slowly over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks as the device blinks a light and beeps softly.

22:42:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident studies a small screen on the device.

22:42:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident opens a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

22:42:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It seemed like you were sort of encouraging people to sign up and blow their suits."

22:42:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a light green efficient round egg storage container from a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

22:42:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But it doesn't really matter, I guess."

22:42:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a light green efficient round egg storage container in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.

22:42:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like you said, I can't stop anyone."

22:42:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a dark gray egg from a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

22:42:59 You glance at your communicator's screen.

22:43:00 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings AEU, Regarding the new Ground combat work available to us, although new work under different circumstances is always challenging and fun! However, I highly discourage anyone to participate in this work for the time-being. While I am in favor of helping to maintain peace amongst citizens and to do whatever it takes to aid and to protect humanity, I am very much not in favor of anyone's participation in work which yields income to ourselves and to the Government towards this Peace-Keeping initiative. If the Government has other options for us to do peace-keeping work which involves no reward, then this will be acceptable. If you do engage, I will not be over-concerned though with reports of destroyed battlesuits. I have a big rubber stamp which will get some much-needed action! Hopefully it won't run dry on ink! [20:35 18 September 2317 GST]

22:43:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a neon purple efficient round egg storage container from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

22:43:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a dark gray egg in a neon purple efficient round egg storage container.

22:44:45 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

22:47:39 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

22:47:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:47:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

22:48:42 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

22:48:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

22:49:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:50:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "Were you able to take a look at your battlesuit yet?"

22:51:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Or did you answer that guy when he asked if you wanted to help?"

22:53:03 You say, "Yeah, I did answer yes, but I couldn't find anything different about my battlesuit."

22:53:28 You say, "I'm going to take an AEU tier 3 in with no weapons."

22:53:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I do have an AEU 2 I think it is. It's not any higher than a 3."

22:54:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So i'd take the laser module off of it or well just not use them."

22:54:12 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's unblinking eyes stare into the middle distance.

22:54:22 You say, "Yeah, exactly."

22:54:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You don't have to remove the module."

22:54:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:54:46 You laugh. "I know. I had an empty slot."

22:54:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

22:55:00 You say, "So, I just bought an AEU tier 3 and didn't put any weapons on it."

22:55:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't and got none through being GSL as the max I can have is ten and I already did."

22:55:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:55:22 "Wow!" You laugh.

22:55:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah it's around 3750 or 3500 or such you get that last one."

22:56:09 You say, "Yeah, I'm not even close yet."

22:56:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Heh I may not be now after what I posted and what i'm going to do!"

22:57:18 Lily says to you, "So love, if we can team up, wanna go in and get wrecked together?"

22:57:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

22:57:32 You exclaim, "Nah, doubt they'll do anything toyou. Constantine, Eli, and Evangeline have been openly against it. And sure, let's!"

22:57:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It might hurt a little."

22:57:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Better than a hangover I suppose!"

22:57:59 You laugh. "Then I'll kiss it all better for you."

22:58:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

22:58:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I'll kiss it all better for you too!"

22:58:29 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

22:59:38 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:01:38 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

23:01:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am not in the mood to deal with the idiots who hangout on General but I do wonder what they know so far."

23:03:42 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

23:05:44 You say, "Yeahm, I'm not tuned into General."

23:05:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

23:12:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

23:12:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

23:12:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it and goes to sleep.

23:13:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Shule, have you left on the mission? If you haven't, I relaly really suggest you abort."

23:14:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also don't think satisfying our curiosity is worth it."

23:14:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just the fact that you'll have a battlesuit there, with or without weapons is going to be pretty damning, and keep the citizens firmly against us."

23:15:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed. Knowing what the missions entails doesn't really help us, but putting suits in the streets is going to escalate this problem."

23:15:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like even if the missions are all above board, it shouldn't matter. We're still on strike."

23:15:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "There's really no reason to even look."

23:19:39 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

23:19:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You also may not be able to explode the suit on this mission, so there might be no opportunity to do damage. For all we know, the mission could just be using the sensors to spy on citizens."

23:21:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Apparently something can happen to your scanner, because there was an option to replace it."

23:26:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

23:28:38 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

23:30:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did we ever get a response? I heard you guys telling him, but didn't hear if he responded."

23:31:38 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

23:31:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think he's busy or resting or something."

23:32:38 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

23:33:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "What've I missed?"

23:34:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Best is trying to get us to do "peacekeeping" operations in our battlesuits."

23:35:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah that. I heard about that but will most likely not do anything aside from svp and ld missions."

23:35:39 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

23:40:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Personally I think best is insain for asking us to do this. While I do not at all mind helping to maintain peace, I don't want to do it for a guy like him. I'd rather do it for myself and the rest of the alliance. That's just me though. And as for it being rewarded, one should not have to accept rewards to feel that they can help to maintain peace. It should be done of one's own free will."

23:46:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Hey, shule?"

23:49:29 You hear your metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.

23:49:34 You hear your metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.
