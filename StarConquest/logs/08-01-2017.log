00:33:22 Your mining drone is searching for a new mining location...

00:33:25 Mining location found.  Your drone is moving toward it.  Arrival in approximately 1.20 minutes.

00:33:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:33:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:33:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:33:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:33:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:33:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:33:39 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:33:40 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

00:33:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:33:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:33:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:33:44 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:33:47 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

00:33:54 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

00:33:55 Your drone is continuing to move to a new mining location. Arrival in approximately 0.70 minutes.

00:33:55 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

00:33:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:34:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:34:02 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

Space Markets: (7, 6, 10)

A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:34:17 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 683,043.60 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

00:34:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:34:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:34:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:34:22 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:34:23 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:58:26 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:58:26 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:58:29 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:58:29 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:58:35 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:58:36 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:58:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "May it go better than our last one."

00:58:38 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

00:58:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:58:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:58:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:58:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:58:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:59:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:59:04 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Sector 11. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:59:04 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:59:06 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

00:59:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:59:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:59:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:59:12 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Sector 11 Outpost in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:59:15 Via general sector communication, Sector 11 Outpost transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to Sector 11."

00:59:28 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ooops, wrong sector."

00:59:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:59:30 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:59:31 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

00:59:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:59:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:59:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:59:35 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:27:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:27:49 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Or better...glorious superflare."

01:27:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:27:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:27:52 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

01:28:02 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:28:03 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

01:28:10 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2197 light-minutes per second from Galactic Southwest and Slightly Down."

01:28:10 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

01:28:11 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

01:28:11 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 139,294.93 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

01:28:12 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:28:21 You kiss Lileah Rose.

01:28:21 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:28:22 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:28:22 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:35:20 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:35:20 A barren hellscape covered in ash stretches on for miles in all directions. Off on the horizon, a massive volcano is spewing ash and fire into the blackened sky from its crater, and glowing lava flows cover the mountain. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans litter the ground. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:35:29 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:46:31 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a standard signal: "Farewell."

01:46:35 You wince as an extremely loud metallic bang emanates from outside the ship.

01:46:37 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:46:38 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:46:39 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:46:40 The starship has left a unique area of space.

01:46:40 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "There once was a pilot in Fringe, who's puns make all of us cringe. She'll say them on comms, while Ather Urmom's, while the rest of us just think she's unhinged. Hello Lexie!"

01:46:48 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

01:46:55 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well that was exciting."

01:46:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

02:04:08 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a wooden wardrobe, a wicker rocking chair, a throw rug, a walnut canopy bed with a lavender silk bedsheet, a floral pattern silk bedsheet, a lilac silk blanket, and a lavender silk pillow on it, a large storage chest, a storage container, a yellow storage locker, a pink mirrored vanity, a shaker chair, and a cedar dresser here.
Lileah Rose is asleep.
You can go out.

02:09:06 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

02:09:06 Current overall point level: 31
Current combat point level: 0

02:09:39 I don't understand that.

02:09:42 Sorry, but no help is available on `idle'.

02:09:50 You peer out...

02:09:51 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

02:09:54 I don't understand that.

02:09:57 I don't understand that.

02:09:58 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:09:59 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:10:00 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:10:00 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:10:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:10:32 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:11:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Would heading out into deep space from 777 in the scout be a good plan for exploration?"

02:11:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's artifacts out there, sure."

02:11:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If that's what you mean."

02:12:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I mean more then just artifacts. Anythign really. My first expedition was just going to be heading into deep space from the dusty reaches."

02:13:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I would focus on artifacts before deep space."

02:13:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "777 is certainly furhter out yes. Though as we talked about the other night, you probably won't find anything. It'll take you a ver` long t|me to even get out of that graveyward."

02:13:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not saying that it's useless or anything, but yeah, you'd probably be better off just getting artifacts so you can get a rift drive."

02:14:48 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 683,226.50 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

02:15:39 You stand up.

02:18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "One reason for that, Tara, is the rift has a way of pooling around things in space, and the sensors can pick those pools up, allowing you to find things like planetary systems, nebulas and so forth."

02:19:33 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]

02:19:33 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

02:19:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Found your snail, Eli."

02:20:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He's a fine snail indeedtran 1 one reason for that, Tara, is the rift has a way of pooling around things in space, and the sensors can pick those pools up, allowing you to find things like planetary systems, nebulas and so forth."

02:20:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm."

02:20:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.

02:21:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Anything interesting happened today?"

02:22:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Partly cloudy?"

02:22:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Someone please. For the love of what little sanity I have. And the tiny remainder of my soul. Shut. Him. Up?"

02:22:25 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Which one?"

02:22:29 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Or both."

02:22:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just a couple of bari pods decided to make their home over New Earth and Clarkson's Push."

02:22:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "The whip."

02:23:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh damn."

02:23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So how bad did it get?"

02:23:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Not bad. We took care of it pretty quickly."

02:23:55 [General Communication] Industrial Whip Nathaniel Owens transmits, "This act is really not going well."

02:24:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sweet."

02:25:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Whoa, noe of them was over New Earth? I didn't know we had one so close."

02:25:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I just knew about the one in clarkson's Push."

02:25:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, one was over New Earth."

02:25:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am guessing everyone had felo to take care of their ships."

02:26:26 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Wait, Eve. You have remaining sanity?"

02:26:39 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's questionable."

02:26:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I am sure it is."

02:27:22 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

02:27:30 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

02:27:30 You can go south, up, and out.

02:27:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:27:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:27:32 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

02:27:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:27:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:27:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:27:52 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "A what nate?"

02:27:55 Would you like to see the FTL map?

02:28:13 [General Communication] Industrial Whip Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I was mearly saying I did not know anyone was sane."

02:28:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Time travelling insanity sandwiches."

02:29:08 [General Communication] Industrial Whip Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Sounds amazing."

02:29:11 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Lordy."

02:29:29 [General Communication] Industrial Whip Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Eve may lose the rest of her sanity in about two minutes, just to inform you all now."

02:30:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits sleepily, "Hey you lot."

02:30:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's not much time to reach minimum safe distance."

02:30:34 That isn't a valid selection.

02:30:36 I don't understand that.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:30:39 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

02:30:39 [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:30:40 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

02:30:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalliste.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:30:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:30:49 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Thankful:y I'm in the rift and my distance seems safe enough."

02:30:54 [General Communication] Industrial Whip Nathaniel Owens transmits, "I'm safe. Unless she can get through a keypad lock."

02:30:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:31:20 I don't understand that.

02:31:23 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:31:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:31:26 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Get her mad and\you might be suprised."

02:31:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Saira."

02:31:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Greetings."

02:31:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hi Saira."

02:32:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww, Sir goldenpants is no longer a kitten. They grow up so fast."

02:32:31 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "We must quickly feed Eve*some sanity sandwiches."

02:32:43 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You have a Sir goldenpants? I should introduce you to Sir Humberton."

02:32:59 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

02:33:35 Sorry, but no help is available on `host'.

02:37:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Vernos Bailey transmits, "Welcome to the c\rps, Raul."

02:38:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hope `ou enjoy your experience as part of@t*e.corps."

02:38:18 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

02:38:18 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:38:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Is there a mall or somewhere where I might be able to pick up a none too expensive camera? I'm a bit of a sucker for documenting things I experience or like and I feel rather naked without the one I left at home."

02:39:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Oh, hello! Welcome!"

02:39:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ryo Stel transmits, "I hear extapa has some."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

02:40:39 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:40:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:40:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:40:42 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:40:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:40:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:40:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits with a laugh, "Is that like a mall or just some really big planet I'm like as not to get lost in?"

02:40:57 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's a City."

02:41:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:41:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:41:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

02:41:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:41:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:41:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:41:16 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:41:17 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

02:41:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:41:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:41:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:41:21 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:41:24 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

02:41:29 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

02:41:29 --

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

02:41:29 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

02:41:32 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:41:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's on the planet of Chetumal."

02:41:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:41:51 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:41:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

02:41:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:42:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:42:11 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:42:12 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:42:12 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:42:14 You peer out...

02:42:15 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

02:42:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:42:36 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:42:43 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

02:42:44 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked. A small light near the hatch is dark and unpowered.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:42:44 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

02:42:46 You exit the ship.

02:44:36 Saira Sorrenson waves to you.

02:44:39 Saira says to you, "Hey there."

02:44:41 You say to Saira, "I can show you where it is."

02:44:54 You smile at Saira Sorrenson.

02:45:05 Saira Sorrenson nods.

02:45:12 You ask, "Would you like me to?"

02:45:29 There is 1 player connected:

02:48:06 Saira Sorrenson says, "Thank you."

02:48:11 You say, "Sure."

02:48:35 You say to Saira, "I do need to warn youthat Ixtapa is a bit of a... naughty town."

02:48:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I will build all the things. In all the places. Or at least. That's what it feels like today."

02:48:48 [Suborbital Pod: Chetumal City to Ixtapa]

02:48:48 You can go nowhere.
Saira Sorrenson followed you.
As soon as you board the pod, it launches from the station, beginning a long arc above the surface.

02:48:55 Saira lofts a querying brow. "Oh?"

02:48:59 You nod.

02:49:07 You say, "There are a lot of adult stores there."

02:49:35 [General Communication] Atticus Bridger transmits, "Now I'm gonna probably sound real silly, but maybe it's just the lack of entry to the cities. But uh... can anyone tell me where a man can find a pack of cigarettes? Haven't seen a damn one being sold in any of these spaceports."

02:49:38 There is 1 player connected:

02:49:39 Rolando Caganda  (A) [n]                             

02:49:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "L5 station."

02:49:57 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'thirty minutes.'"

02:49:58 Saira chews on her lower lip. "Ah, well... that's all right," she allows delicately. "Is there a mall somewhere in case I find I ... don't like shopping here? Though I do have older brothers, so it's probably nothing I've not already endured."

02:50:25 [General Communication] Atticus Bridger transmits, "And where is that at?"

02:50:25 You say, "There is a mall, but this is one of the only ones that has cameras."

02:50:34 Saira Sorrenson nods.

02:50:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Or um...Where's the other place?"

02:50:39 You say, "I can take you to another mall after here."

02:50:52 The suborbital pod reaches the top of its arc, coming to a gradual stop before beginning to plummet back to the surface.

02:51:23 You say to Saira, "I meant like bedroomnaughty."

02:51:25 You grin.

02:51:37 "Where is it located?" Saira asks, leaning back against the wall of the pod and splaying her palms against its surface for balance. "You don't need to bore yourself by being my tour guide. I like to explore and it can take a while."

02:52:01 You say, "Oh, I don't mind. Unless you want to explore on your own."

02:52:07 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You can find some stuff on Centauri colony, on Gulch street or Cardinas gambling district."

02:52:12 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Bikura?"

02:52:44 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Centauri don't sell cigaretts though. They sell loose stuff and papers. And fancy lighters."

02:52:46 The pod's braking thrusters suddenly kick in, abruptly slowing the pod as it nears the surface.

02:52:56 The pod settles onto the ground, and you depart.

02:52:56 [Ixtapa; Suborbital Pod System]
You can go west.

02:53:01 "We'll see," Saira admits. "I don't mind company most of the time, but I also tend to feel bad if I'm darting into every store I see and dragging someone along." A beat, then a lopsided little grin. "My brothers hated it when I did that." A wistful sigh. "The torture was glorious."

02:53:13 You say, "Oh, I don't mind at all."

02:53:15 Saira Sorrenson grins.

02:53:18 You grin.

03:04:52 She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has sun-kissed tawny skin. Her body is delicate with sensually curved hips and shapely calves. She has lissome shoulders and pert breasts. Her face is symmetrically ovular and high cheekboned, with an aquiline nose and gently rounded chin. Her lips are full and pomegranate red and occasionally part to reveal a set of even, white teeth. Beneath a set of gracefully arched eyebrows, her eyes are slate blue and heavy-lidded. Her waist-length, silky hair is russet and teased into loosely flowing waves down her back. She has meticulously manicured light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a black velvet beret, a long black sleeveless silk dress, an expensive platinum watch with sapphire accents, a silvery gray silk sash, and a pair of black jelly ballet flats with a matching bow. She is also wearing a fine gold link necklace with a light-catching red crystal teardrop pendant, a pair of shimmering red crystal drop earrings, and a glittering red crystal bracelet. Her face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.

The rails along the edge of the hexagonal apex form a rather inadequate windbreak, and the force of the wind continually pushes you against other people and into various immobile objects. Teenagers accelerate past you on reactionless footjets, braking abruptly in front of stores or apartments, or skimming at reckless speeds down ramps leading to lower levels. A section of missing rail to the east turns out, upon careful examination, to lead to a steep ramp.
You see a sanitation drone here.
Saira Sorrenson is standing here.
You can go east, south, and northwest.

03:09:44 You can't go that way.

[1] Chetumal City

Enter your selection.
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

03:09:55 Your suborbital pod ride will cost 10,000.00 Fringe credits.  Do you wish to pay this price?

03:09:56 [Enter `yes' or `no']

03:09:57 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'ten minutes.'"

03:09:57 You pay 10,000.00 Fringe credits, and are informed that a suborbital pod will arrive within two minutes.

03:10:01 You say, "It's on this planet."

03:10:08 Saira Sorrenson says, "Aaaah."

03:10:26 Saira Sorrenson says, "For a poor alliance, they certainly boast many shopping attractions."

03:10:31 You nod.

03:10:39 You say, "For sure."

03:11:33 [Suborbital Pod: Ixtapa to Chetumal City]

03:11:33 You can go nowhere.
Saira Sorrenson followed you.
As soon as you board the pod, it launches from the station, beginning a long arc above the surface.

03:11:40 You sit down.

03:12:32 There is 1 player connected:

03:12:32 Rolando Caganda  (A) [n]                             

03:13:28 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

03:13:37 The suborbital pod reaches the top of its arc, coming to a gradual stop before beginning to plummet back to the surface.

03:14:22 You stand up.

03:14:29 Saira Sorrenson smiles.

03:14:35 You smile at Saira Sorrenson.

03:14:57 Saira grimaces. "Urgh... I don't like pods... they fall way too fast."

03:15:13 You say, "Yeah, it's a bit uncomfortable the first few times."

03:15:21 You say, "I've kind of gotten used to it."

03:15:31 The pod's braking thrusters suddenly kick in, abruptly slowing the pod as it nears the surface.

03:15:41 The pod settles onto the ground, and you depart.

03:15:41 [Chetumal; Suborbital Pod System]
You can go southeast.

03:15:45 [Chetumal City; Plire Road and Seaview Track]

03:15:45 You can go north, south, west, and northwest.
Saira Sorrenson followed you.

03:15:54 "I keep expecting those thrusters to fail and..." Saira Sorrensonfalls silent. "Wlel, you can imagine the unpleasantness."

03:16:18 Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident points to the south, "Keep following this road south and at the end, you'll see the mall. It's right across form the courthouse.

03:16:23 You say, "From."

03:16:36 You say to Saira, "Nah, they're not going to fail."

03:17:59 There is 1 player connected:

03:17:59 Rolando Caganda  (A) [n]                             

03:19:58 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra et bruyo. Poae bruyo won ske bruyi sket jukl gary wuharel."

03:20:05 Saira dips her head in a nod. "Thank you, Shule," she murmurs. "I think I'll just... wander for a while. My mind's a bit preoccupied and I don't want to keep you."

03:20:23 You smile at Saira Sorrenson.

03:20:28 You say, "Take care and be safe."

03:20:35 Saira Sorrenson smiles at you.

03:20:36 You say, "I don't want to bother you either."

03:20:39 Saira Sorrenson says, "I will certainly try."

03:20:39 You grin.

03:20:50 Saira Sorrenson shakes her head.

03:21:00 Saira Sorrenson says, "You're not a bother at all. Thank you for taking the time out."

03:21:09 You say, "Oh, it's nothing really."

03:21:11 Saira Sorrenson grins.

03:21:14 You say, "I'm glad I could help."

03:21:16 Saira Sorrenson leaves your group.

03:21:21 You wave to Saira Sorrenson.

03:21:23 Saira Sorrenson waves.

03:21:39 Saira Sorrenson wanders west.

03:22:16 [Chetumal Spaceport; Passenger Station]

03:22:16 You can go northeast.

03:22:18 [Chetumal Spaceport; Passenger Station]

03:22:18 This small room is filled with uncomfortable plastic seating and small displays showing starship arrivals and departures. Several anxious people watch the screens, leaning forward at each declared arrival, hoping it means a starship pilot is about to arrive and ask for passengers.
You can go northeast.

03:22:21 [Chetumal Spaceport; Level Two]

03:22:21 You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, and down.

03:22:22 [Chetumal Spaceport; Level Two]

03:22:22 Considered to be the hub of the spaceport, this circular area is nearly always crowded with travelers, traders, and pilots from all parts of known space. Though the area is neither large nor well lit, it is impressive in its own way. Beyond the people milling about, the dark gray metal walls gleam in the low light, with doorways framed in brushed black metal leading to adjoining shops and services, including a bar to the southeast advertised by a garish orange neon sign over the entrance. Strong steel beams with triangular cutouts follow the curve of the wall upward, meeting overhead in an array of sleek monitors displaying the news of the day. Main corridors extend away from the hub to the north, east, south, and west, and near the west corridor, wide ramps lead up and down to other levels of the spaceport. Around the perimeter of the ceiling is a circular DISPLAY that you can READ for directions to various areas in the spaceport.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, and down.

03:22:50 [Chetumal Spaceport; Level Two Corridor]

03:22:56 You can go southeast.

03:22:57 [Chetumal; Xenology Center]

03:22:57 Though you are denied access to the majority of the xenology center, there is plenty here to hold your interest. Dozens of alien artifacts, when not being studied, are placed on display behind clear plasteel. You examine the artificial monopoles and exotic synthetic materials and wonder idly about the species that may have created them.
You can go southeast.

03:22:59 [Chetumal Spaceport; Level Two]

03:23:00 You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, and down.

03:23:00 [Chetumal Spaceport; Medical Center]

03:23:00 You can go southwest.

03:23:01 [Chetumal Spaceport; Medical Center]

03:23:02 The design of this small but modern medical center is modular, with pale gray walls and slightly rounded corners. Arrays of diagnostic equipment and cabinets of medicines are carefully guarded and maintained by the efficient white-clad personnel on duty. Several sleekly designed medical creches, rather dismayingly shaped like coffins, are lined up along the far side of the room. A sign overhead instructs those with injuries to LIE in a CRECHE.
You can go southwest.

03:23:07 [Chetumal Spaceport; Level Two]

03:23:07 You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, and down.

03:23:11 [Chetumal Spaceport; Garage]

03:23:11 You can go up and down.

03:23:15 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

03:23:15 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

03:23:15 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

03:23:16 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

03:23:17 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

03:23:17 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:23:18 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:23:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

03:23:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:23:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:24:16 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Orange 7" has jumped into the sector.

03:24:17 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Orange 2" has jumped into the sector.

03:24:18 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Yellow 0" has jumped into the sector.

03:24:19 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello there, Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Orange 7! Welcome to home space!"

03:24:20 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello there, Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Orange 2! Welcome to home space!"

03:24:20 There is little point in launching, since the ship is already in space.

03:24:21 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Hello there, Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Yellow 0! Welcome to home space!"

03:24:28 Which sector did you mean?

03:24:28 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

03:24:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:24:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:24:30 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:24:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:24:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:24:36 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Yellow 0" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

03:24:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:24:37 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

03:24:38 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:24:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:24:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:24:41 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:24:44 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:24:50 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:24:53 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:24:53 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

03:24:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

03:24:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:25:06 The ship is already moving.

03:25:08 The ship is already moving.

03:25:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:25:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:25:13 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:25:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:25:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:25:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:25:33 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:29:06 You pull a large lever towards you.

03:29:06 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:08:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So what all is needed to do artifacting?"

04:09:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You need a space suit, space suit jet, Navaid, and a ship and patience. An artifact detector is nice too."

04:09:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Where do I get the jet and navaid?"

04:09:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh and an artifact container."

04:09:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Over on the Torus."

04:09:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Same for the container?"

04:10:12 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Rest Station from the two-person light transport "Rhino". The organization has earned 343,384.10 credits.

04:10:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Actually, you can get the container at the xenology center on New Earth or any capitol planet."

04:10:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, how much do they cost?"

04:10:56 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

04:10:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

04:11:00 Not much to see out there.

04:11:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

04:11:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:11:04 You peer out...

04:11:04 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north and down.

04:11:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:11:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:11:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:11:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't remember. Not much though."

04:11:22 The ship is already moving.

04:11:24 The ship is already moving.

04:11:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:11:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:11:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:11:26 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

04:11:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:11:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:11:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:11:33 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:11:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

04:11:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:11:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:11:38 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:11:38 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:11:40 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

04:11:44 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

04:11:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:12:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:12:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

04:12:21 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

04:12:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

04:12:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

04:12:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:12:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:12:41 Though you are denied access to the majority of the xenology center, there is plenty here to hold your interest. Dozens of alien artifacts, when not being studied, are placed on display behind clear plasteel. You examine the artificial monopoles and exotic synthetic materials and wonder idly about the species that may have created them.

05:42:35 You say, "And yeah, don't forget your clothes in there."

05:42:38 You grin.

05:42:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I mean. Who's comms are getting clearer? That was like, out of nowhere."

05:42:57 [General Communication] "The rautines took off with my waffles!" Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cackles!

05:43:10 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, im in the warzone rift."

05:43:15 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its quite scary."

05:43:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um...Okay, who gave Eli haze?"

05:43:34 Lileah Rose says to you, "yep i will when i finally get going again."

05:43:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, was trying to sorta talk Tara though that battlezone in the rift."

05:43:37 Lileah Rose grins.

05:43:59 You grin.

05:44:08 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I admit nothing."

05:44:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And Evenia? You say that as if you don't transmit strange shit."

05:44:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I want to bring a souviner back from the rift somehow, some day."

05:45:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure you will."

05:45:26 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

05:45:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Does a fragmented reality count as a souvenir?"

05:45:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "..I dunno?"

05:45:44 There are 2 players connected:

05:45:44 Lileah Rose  (A)          Rolando Caganda  (A) [n]   

05:45:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I never do. Everything I transmit makes complete and total sense."

05:45:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I used to think the whole thing was some strange hallucination, but the fact that sometimes objects will stick around once you drop out kinda proves that ti's not."

05:46:04 You say to Lileah Rose, "I'll probably take your big salvaging ship out for a few salvaging runs tomorrow."

05:46:13 Lileah Rose exclaims, "oh sure enjoy!"

05:46:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah, This ammocrate infront of me looks and feels real."

05:46:24 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Right... Eve."

05:46:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Quiet you."

05:46:37 Lileah Rose says, "I am not that interested in salvaging so glad it will be put to good use."

05:46:44 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And again. I'm totally and completely innocent. Wait, that is true."

05:47:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So if you're innocent. That means Eli is dark-skinned. Right?"

05:47:08 Lileah Rose says, "i might try that fancy ship sometime though but I'd like to try to figure out trading whenever i have the time."

05:47:13 You grin.

05:47:20 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

05:47:28 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It must be so."

05:47:38 Lileah Rose asks, "have you worked out anything ina Sim yet?"

05:47:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! You guys remember that time we were transmiting strange shit on comms? That was a blast."

05:47:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli sir. Are you dark-skinned?"

05:47:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Seems that my ship is slowly getting faster."

05:47:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

05:47:54 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli, just say yes."

05:48:09 You say, "Nope, not yet."

05:48:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, you've never seen me from before, but I actually used to have quite fair skin."

05:48:15 You wrap your arms around Lileah Rose.

05:48:19 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I so have? In that photo."

05:48:19 Lileah Rose nods.

05:48:26 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

05:48:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh I forgot you saw a photo."

05:48:47 You say, "But I should."

05:48:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Indeed I did."

05:49:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, before the blue skin thing I think the description of "some dude" fit me quite well."

05:49:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hmmm."

05:49:41 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent". The organization has earned 2,378,575.37 credits.

05:49:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "As in if you saw me and had to describe to someone what you saw, you'd just say "It was just some dude""

05:50:25 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hey, just because you are blue doesn't mean you aren't still just some dude."

05:50:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey! Thanks Johann!"

05:50:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I wouldn't say so. Personally. But that's just my opinion. For what it's worth."

05:50:36 Lileah Rose says, "yeah is ther one in this ship? I forget and sorry there's a lot of stuff in the Control room up there."

05:50:40 You squeeze Lileah Rose affectionately.

05:50:43 You say, "I'm not sure."

05:50:45 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I'm not prejudiced based on color."

05:50:47 You say, "I'l look."

05:50:51 Lileah Rose chuckles.

05:50:53 You say, "sometime"

05:50:56 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

05:50:59 Lileah Rose grins at you.

05:51:16 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

05:51:28 You grin at Lileah Rose.

05:52:58 Lileah Rose wraps her arms around you.

05:53:00 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Now, Kaido, he was just some dude, even with the shark thing he had going on."

05:53:06 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On that note, good night all."

05:53:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Night Shule."

05:53:24 [General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Night ni."

05:53:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Goodnight shule."

05:53:49 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Night Eve. May yourdreams be filled with firestorms when the time comes for sleep."

05:53:50 Lileah Rose says to you, "I'm sorry if i came onto you so soon. I just thought you know ... we only live once and so why hold back if there is someone you really find to be attractive and sexy"

05:53:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach mutters.

05:53:59 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

05:54:05 [General Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

05:54:27 You say to Lileah Rose, "No need to be sorry."

05:54:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Shove that damn firestorm up your...anyway."

05:54:31 You smile at Lileah Rose.

05:54:32 Lileah Rose says, "i'm just like you in that I thought I would only just fly and pilot."

05:54:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

05:54:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It seems like the battle has calmed down some. Phew."

05:54:44 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles at Evenia an Eachtrannach.

05:54:50 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "That's easy, just eat tacos."

05:55:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know, he might have just been some dude to you. But the first time I met that guy he trapped me in my ship with a stun trap and then beat the shit out of me for fun. That's not just some dude to me, that's a little psychopathic."

05:55:01 Lileah Rose says, "I went out into deep space for over a year. It was strange, never hearing anyone else's voice."

05:55:07 You say, "wow"

05:55:29 Lileah Rose says, "I would talk to myself some jsut so I could realize that I could still talk. I sang lots of songs out there haha."

05:55:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He was always mostly cool with me after that though, so I guess it was some sort of weird shark man initiation."

05:55:55 You say to Lileah Rose, "I was going to tell you when you said let's sit down somewhere more comfotable that if you picked somewhere too comfortable, I'd be tempted to do something like take all of your clothes off. "

05:55:56 Lileah Rose kisses you.

05:55:59 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I...Um yeah. That's a touch nuts."

05:56:00 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Who knows. He was a strange one."

05:56:03 You kiss Lileah Rose.

05:56:08 Lileah Rose says, "that is how I earned a lot of credits"

05:56:14 You grin at Lileah Rose.

05:56:19 Lileah Rose grins at you.

05:56:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well I suppose if I was shark guy,  I might be a little angry too. From what I understand he didn't exactly ask for that."

05:56:30 You say, "And yeah, I can imagine that exploring out on your own could get a bit lonely."

05:56:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Seems that the comms are pretty abuzz tonight."

05:56:38 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I think the strangest pilot I ever met though who stuck around longer than six months was Meteu."

05:57:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Night AEU."

05:57:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well I can understand anger. But smacking the shit out of someone. Just coz? That's unhinged."

05:57:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Night, Shule!"

05:57:07 Lileah Rose says, "so when you get enough for a navigational aid and a jet, I would love to show you what it's like out there."

05:57:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh it can get chattier than this. Most folks are way out of comms range right now."

05:57:25 You smile.

05:57:29 You exclaim, "That'd be fun!"

05:57:54 Lileah Rose asks, "so how's your points now?"

05:57:59 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

05:57:59 Current overall point level: 31
Current combat point level: 0

05:58:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wel, ok in the spirit of fairness I will say that I threw the first punch. But that was after he had me trapped in my ship for over an hour with that stun trap outside, and then finally said it was cool and that I could come out now. When I did the trap was still there and I got the shit stunned out of me."

05:58:07 You say, "I have 31 overall points"

05:58:12 You say, "not that many"

05:58:14 Lileah Rose cheers for you.

05:58:29 Lileah Rose says, "well sorry I didn't help you out any this morning"

05:58:37 Lileah Rose says, "maybe tomorrow though."

05:58:46 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well in that case, you had every right to throw the first punch. It was he who started it."

05:58:47 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What was so werid about um.. what did you say the name was Johann?"

05:58:54 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Meteu?"

05:59:01 You say, "It's fine."

05:59:03 You grin.

05:59:10 Lileah Rose grins at you.

05:59:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah.."

05:59:15 You say, "You were super helpful yesterday"

05:59:18 You grin.

05:59:33 Lileah Rose says to you, "by the way, if you want to haul asteroids feel free to use the hauler"

05:59:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That name actually sounds kinda familiar."

05:59:41 You say, "ok, thanks."

05:59:43 You smile.

05:59:53 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

06:00:22 Lileah Rose says, "I think using a big shp will certainly help you to gather a lot of debris faster though and that should be good for you."

06:00:24 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "He had more than a few screws loose, and he's the reason I think it was Keegan got blacklisted from League space for a while."

06:00:38 You say, "ok, I should go to sleep and yeah, it will. That will really help."

06:00:42 You smile.

06:00:46 Lileah Rose says, "same here Love."

06:00:48 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "He would randomly leave his ships unlocked and I'm pretty sure it was keegan who would end up stealing them."

06:00:52 You smile at Lileah Rose.

06:00:58 You say, "ok, good night and rest well"

06:01:01 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Like this happend more than twice."

06:01:22 Lileah Rose says to you, "nite and rest well."

06:01:23 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Why would you leave your ships unlocked?"

06:01:38 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I have no clue."

06:01:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Didn't you just hear what he said? He said the guy had a screw loose."

06:01:46 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "More than a few."

06:02:05 You kiss Lileah Rose on the lips.

06:02:21 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. Because I haven't said it yet this mission. Tentacles!"

06:02:27 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "He was pretty good at trading though."

06:02:39 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, you are doing your missions, I was gonna see if you wanted to race."

06:02:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Almost there.."

06:02:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Which, you would probably win anyways, with that damn huge hold."

06:02:54 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You wanna race the salvage queen?"

06:03:30 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. I'm taking offence for my hold here. She is not huge, she's just...roomy."

06:03:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sigh of relief."

06:03:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's how I feel right now."

06:04:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Survive the battle?"

06:04:08 [General Communication] Johann Schraft snickers.

06:04:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Mhm!"

06:04:17 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Shut it you."

06:09:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I will salvage all the things, damn it."

06:17:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

06:19:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We need to find you a Cup O' tentacles."

06:19:14 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes!"

06:19:24 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "All the tentacles!"

06:20:09 [General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've a fuzzy octopus won from a rather eyesore inducing machine."

06:20:44 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles. "I love that machine. I can never resist."

06:25:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station from the two-person medium transport "Salvage Regent". The organization has earned 1,698,656.24 credits.

06:33:01 You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order to avoid being disconnected.

06:37:01 Lileah Rose yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

06:38:01 You have been idle too long.  Have a lovely evening.
    * You have been disconnected. Please come back soon. *

06:57:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Three heavies taken out in the fighter cadets can get isn't to obad, right? I mean.. all my turrets were destroyed."

06:58:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey AEU."

06:58:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh Tara, how was 777?"

06:59:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Good, I probably made close to ten million salvaging. The return trip was an hour of being stuck in an battlefield."

07:00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh no! What happened?"

07:00:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The rift made it like I was in the trenches of some old, old historical battle."

07:00:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ohh, like a crazy rift battlefield."

07:00:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

07:02:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that you in Dreamseeker?"

07:02:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Mhm!"

07:03:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

07:03:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, AEU space remains clear."

07:03:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To my shame we never cleared the frontier."

07:04:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's not really worth it at this point, though."

07:04:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Would anyone like 2 beacons?"

07:04:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I could go for one once I finish finding this lost probe."

07:04:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You got it!"

07:07:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm always happy to gun, given you've the chair for it."

07:07:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, this is gona be a run."

07:08:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay, maybe I can borrow a gunship from somebody."

07:08:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Six heavy fighters in the area, the disabled pod is on the other side of the sector."

07:08:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can do it!"

07:08:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Imagine how much more scary it will be when you're getting actual artifacts and you have to leave your ship to get them."

07:09:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still wonder what would happen if a RAT caught up to me while I was on a spacewalk."

07:09:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hopefully you're not wearing a metal belt buckle, should that happen."

07:09:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

07:09:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "There is a LOT of debris in this area.."

07:09:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "If this nest isn't taken care of, there'll be tons of RATs."

07:10:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im counting at least ten chunks."

07:10:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm. Where is that nest?"

07:10:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do want to do a nest before this conquest ends."

07:10:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Two sectors west of the old frontier."

07:10:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Argh, rats near our beacons."

07:11:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Again? I just cleared out a good chunk."

07:11:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is a nest, they sort of propagate from them."

07:11:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Those things replicate like crazy."

07:11:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though, I imagine by the time I could assemble a crew to destroy it, they might have consumed the debris and moved on."

07:12:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, Im clear. Theyl eft me alone, suprisingly."

07:13:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's good. They're actually sort of slow. As long as you don't start very close to any you should be able to pull artifacts from nest sectors without too much trouble."

07:13:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been hit by drills a few times doing it, but I've never been too badly banged up."

07:14:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Shoulda seen the five pirates I had to deal with in 777. I kept using the watch towers laser on them and they warped out one by one."

07:14:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow. Did they interdict the sector?"

07:14:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Don't think so."

07:14:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it's good that you ran them off."

07:14:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Too many people use 777 to let pirates hang around."

07:17:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much industry did you get doing all that salvage?"

07:17:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Won't know until the storage container is brought to a starport."

07:17:30 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

07:17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, did you not eject the container before you left?"

07:18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nope, Should I have?"

07:18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, when you're done salvaging you should leave your ship, go upstairs to the control center, and eject the module."

07:18:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry, I should have told you that."

07:18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Orion's the same way."

07:18:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's okay, you'll still get the points. The processor isn't going down any time soon."

07:19:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If I got out there later I'll eject it."

07:19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "If you go now the rift was flowing towards 777. Its why my return trip was so bad long."

07:19:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Might have changed by now though."

07:20:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, either way it will be a longish trip. I'll do it after I sleep."

07:20:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I think I'm in heaven."

07:20:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What makes you think that?"

07:20:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean it's great that you do."

07:20:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've come across a wonderful onsen and the food is great."

07:20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

07:21:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ooh, nice."

07:21:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where is that?"

07:21:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I've seen that but I can't remember."

07:21:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that on Hyperion?"

13:06:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:06:08 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

17:22:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How's your industry looking?"

17:22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Meh. Not so great. I'm just salvaging now, but that doesn't seem to bring in many industry points."

17:22:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The higher grade stuff means more points. I just dropped off a load worth 1.6 Million and six points."

17:23:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Yikes."

17:23:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So as you get more points in industry and upgrade your salvage rapple and gear, it'll get faster."

17:23:23 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Lexie tells jokes all the time. Sometimes they don't even rhyme. On general she shouts, the rest of us pout, and wish Fringe would give her a fine."

17:24:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "I'll read the upgrade book and see when I'll be eligible for it!"

17:24:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Anyway, I gotta rest. See you later!"

17:24:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "See you later, Tara. And great work!"

17:25:32 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

17:34:09 [General Communication] Johann Schraft chuckles.

19:48:37 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:48:37 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:49:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:49:34 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

19:49:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:49:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:49:39 You glance at your communicator's screen.

19:49:39 You have one mail message.

19:49:44 The ship is already moving.

19:49:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:49:45 The ship is already in that sector.

19:49:47 The ship is already in that sector.

19:49:50 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

19:49:50 [Enter `yes' or `no']

19:49:51 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

19:49:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

19:49:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:50:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:50:06 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

19:50:07 You pull a large lever towards you.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:50:08 You scramble to your feet.

19:50:08 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:50:27 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

19:50:27 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

19:50:28 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

19:50:28 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:50:28  You are wearing a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt, a pair of slim Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

19:50:28 You are carrying a small package in your right hand.

19:50:31 a small package

19:50:31 This is a package. It is addressed to Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident, and was sent by Lexie Amarras.
It is closed.
You open a small package.
Inside it you see a tiny stone howling wolf statue with amethyst accents and a letter.

19:50:38 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

19:51:01 --

19:51:02 Dear Shule,

Thanks for being there to get blown up with me and to save me from pirates.  It's much appreciative.  This one looked insane enough, and I found him a nice padded box.

Lexie

19:51:17 You crumple up a letter and throw it in a nearby garbage can.

19:51:21 You toss your package in a nearby garbage can.

19:51:40 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

19:51:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

19:51:46 Your communicator reports that...

19:51:46 
At least three recently active pilots are relaxing at Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge.

19:51:49 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:51:49 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:51:50 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:51:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:51:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:52:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:52:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:52:06 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:52:06 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

19:52:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:52:11 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

19:52:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:52:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:52:13 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:52:14 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

19:52:14 You say nothing to Lileah Rose.

19:52:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:52:16 [Starship "Blueberry"; Living Quarters One]

19:52:16 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on fuchsia status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Lileah Rose is asleep.
You can go out.
(You are lying on a walnut canopy bed.)

19:52:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:52:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:52:18 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:52:21 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

19:52:23 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

19:52:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:52:30 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

19:52:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

19:52:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:52:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:52:49 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:52:49 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:52:51 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:52:53  You are wearing a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt, a pair of slim Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks.

19:53:28 You say, "Hi Luja."

19:53:46 Luja Garland says into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Hi, Jada."

19:54:19 Luja Garland says, "I'm going from civilian pilot to just a plain old civilian in around..."

19:54:20 Luja Garland glances down at her watch momentarily.

19:54:30 Luja Garland says, "4 hours or so."

19:54:47 You say to Luja, "Awww. Well, we'll miss you."

19:54:53 You hug Luja Garland.

19:58:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:58:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:58:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:58:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:58:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:58:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:58:23 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

20:24:23 That isn't a valid selection.

20:24:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

20:24:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:24:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:24:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

20:26:33 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

20:26:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:26:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:26:51 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

20:26:56 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

20:27:00 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a drifting cloud of tritium.

20:27:01 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (2, 8, 8)

20:27:02 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (2, 8, 8)

20:27:11 Those coordinates are invalid.  The format is: "x, y, z"

20:27:51 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Lily's notes say that the top is a control center."

20:28:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But the beacon does broadcast a message."

20:28:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can any beacon broadcast a message?"

20:28:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:28:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It can if it has a message top."

20:28:27 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

20:28:32 Scanning reveals no nearby debris.

20:28:34 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

20:28:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay. So should I just put a message top on this."

20:28:40 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:28:56 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:31:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's sometimes on a different temp station. So, not sure. Is there arleady one out there that has a message top?"

20:32:00 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

20:32:05 Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's hold.

20:34:53 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

20:34:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:34:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, it's just the one that says the standard beacon network is one sector galactic east."

20:35:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I should build one with a message top then?"

20:35:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:35:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sorry, which beacon are you building?"

20:35:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Home beacon 776."

20:35:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah, no message beacon for that one."

20:36:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. That message is just automatic?"

20:36:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

20:36:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Amazing."

20:36:27 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

20:36:32 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

20:36:37 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a single spacesuit glove.

21:10:49 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

21:10:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:10:56 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

21:10:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:10:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:10:58 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:11:01 You peer out...

21:11:01 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The luxury sightseer "Celestial Explorer" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

21:11:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Celestial Explorer, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:11:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
There is little point in launching, since the ship is already in space.

21:11:06 The computer reports that the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 790" has jumped out of the sector.

21:11:13 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

21:11:13 
Courier starship departed to AEU sector Providence Gate (Alpha-1) approximately 3 minutes ago.
Courier starship departed to AEU sector Providence Gate (Alpha-1) less than a minute ago.
The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:11:15 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:11:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:11:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:11:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:11:19 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

21:11:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:11:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:11:23 There appear to be about 19 pilots recently active.

21:11:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:11:24 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:11:24 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

21:11:24 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:11:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:11:29 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:11:29 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of radium.

21:11:32 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Celestial Explorer! Welcome to home space!"

21:14:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:14:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Saira."

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:14:12 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

21:14:13 I don't understand that.

21:14:13 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:14:14 I don't understand that.

21:14:16 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (2, 12, 2)

21:14:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:14:42 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

21:14:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

21:14:53 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

21:14:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Capital Assets.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:14:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:15:04 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

21:15:04 Current overall point level: 32

21:15:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Though... how'd you know it was me inside this ship?"

21:15:53 The sounds from the ship's hold cease as the cargo finishes transferring.

21:16:49 You apply your thumb to the thumbprint scanner of a portable point unit, which contacts the nearest license points center.

21:16:49 Current overall point level: 37

21:17:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits dubiously, "Lucky guess... seeing as how there are probably way more of us flying around than just me."

21:18:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, I do sometimes manage to get lucky."

You can go south, up, and out.

22:27:34 You wave.

22:27:36 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:27:36 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

22:30:26 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I've done it before. I ran out of expert battle restorations in the middle of an IFS cruiser beacon, and had to craft right then."

22:30:39 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"

22:30:49 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'm sure it was nerve racking."

22:51:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:51:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:51:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:51:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:51:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:51:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:51:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:52:05 The ship is already moving.

22:52:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:52:10 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:52:10 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:52:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

22:52:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:52:15 The computer reports that the one-person cargo hauler "Swansong" has landed on the planet New Earth.

22:52:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:52:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:52:17 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:52:18 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

22:52:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:52:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:52:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:52:22 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:35:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

23:35:55 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:35:58 I don't understand that.

23:36:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:36:47 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:36:52 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

23:36:57 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an abandoned storage pod.

The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:52:10 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

23:52:15 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

23:52:20 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a defunct sector probe.
