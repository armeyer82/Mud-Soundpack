Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing
red and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, a
small red insulated cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot, a small purple ball
containing a dingling bell, and Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved purple top with a brightly colored
dragon print, a pair of skinny blue low rise jeans, and a pair of mystic purple
suede clogs. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten
on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria
perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both
hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on the floor.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike", the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout
Zeta-6", and the scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Lambda-7" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na. I was a bit too disgusted
at Gabrielle's appearance to take pictures."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How about the mushroom guy."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'd have to look. I know I
don't have a single photo of him, but he might be in a group one."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Who agreed to be in a group
photo with a mushroom?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lots of people!"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I mean, I guess it'd hide any
flaws with your own face."

Lily Kaise kisses you.
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well. What abot that time? What
would have wrked differently?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "See, this is why you should
come on old frontier! You can't really mess up so it's a good practice place.
Old frontier woo!"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But then, the AEU government
would have access to a mining station."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I miss cleaning out Old
Frontier. It's been a while."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then again...it's totally
possible to mess up on old frontier if you run into vine clusters with bad
combinations. Never mind me."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The AEu government already has
access to a mining station. There's nothing you can relaly do to prevent that."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Due to the non-aggression pacts
with the other alliances, I do believe that AEU pilots get the resources they
mine at their asteroid stations transferred over to the AEU as well. Or at
least, large portions of them."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "This is something I found out
only recently, myself! See? Old pilots odn't know everything."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "There's Glittering Belt
anyway, who's is that?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ours. That's why I said the AEU
already has access to a mining station."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Sorry, missed you saying
that."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Why give them a second?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Why give League about three?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They technically have access to
a second, too! And a third! And a fourth!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure, those ones would be
slightly taxed, but doesn't mean they count any less."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That slight taxation means less
credits for Best."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Chuckle and ' not by that
much."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Something is better than
nothing."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh are we continuing? I thought
you guys launched when I wasn't looking. I wasn't sure."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is it doable?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I'm not really trying to
disuade you from your unsound and flawed logic, I'm just trying to tell you that
your logic is not really that sound when it comes to the station."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Not with three of us."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That station is better for
mining than the other one, right?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Better than the glittering belt
that is."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Honestly there are several main
worths of that station including the mining, to be sure. My star lounge too woo.
Let's also not forget though, the upgrades shop. It's got some good low-end and
high-end upgrades for newer and older pilots alike."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I never quite understood whose
idea it was to put an upgrades shop on a mining station."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not having access to this
station is inconvenient for Best's government, yes?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not really, I doubt they care
much. It's more inconvenient for the pilots than the government."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Otherwise they'd have made more
attempts at clearing the place out rather than leaving it up to us for the most
part."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "These upgrades would not be
useful for any other type of ship? The navy or merchants wouldn't benefit from
them?"
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Ather, you still wantin' ta
do the cleansing now?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Thanks for coming again, and
sorry about how that went."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If so, I'll just switch
suits."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The navy and the merchants have
never really gotten any of the special-end upgrades that I've ever seen. Not
from any of our upgrade shops. Heck, I don't even ever recall seeing any of them
with sensor dampeners, but they are home defense forces, usually. Who can know
what the patroling navy gets? Also, I very much doubt that the naval and
merchant factions get their upgrades from the same places we get them."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, I wanna know what
suit I oughta bring."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And yes, frontier for sure! Who
has EAOS suits they'd be willing to use?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My best is Muty 4."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I can get plasma on my
Muty."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have an EAOS 3 if you
have room for me."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We always have glorious room.
Damien, Ted, do either of you have repairs with your Mutuality suits? Or can one
of you switch to AEU if you have it?"
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I got my AEU 5 on me right
now."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "You want me ta bring that?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have microdrones on my AEU."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Why do you have microdrones on
your AEU."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think he means on his
Mutuality."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Muty even, sorry."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And, because, at tier 4, they
are the most effective on that suit."
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure, Damien. Bring that. Ted,
outfit your Mutuality suit with plasma if you haven't done so already.
Constantine...new earth lounge with your EAOS 3. Anyone else?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Muty without plasma? Is that
even a thing?"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "At early levels, I believe so!"
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Been so long since I've
operated one. Was never fond of them even in the days that I could buy one."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Never done that myself."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
[General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Last call! Anyone else on their
way?"
[General Communication] Bryan Stout yawns.

[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, Katina?"
[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "What ship were you docking
again?"
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "It'll be my capsule."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Alright."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I'll come by with it once
we finish at the processor, I'm hoping."
[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "No worries, take your time, just
have your ship docked before departure tomorrow."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Did ya send me a key?"
[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I did."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Cool, thanks."
[General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "What is everyone up to?"

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The

[Nouveau Quebec; Docking Bay]
Noise, light, and a faint aroma of warm maple syrup greet visitors to this large
docking bay. People wander around, some, including technicians and mechanics,
tending to the usual business with starships, but others are apparently merely
congregating in order to gossip, scrutinize passersby, and exclaim about bees.
The bay itself is a large hexagon some 200 meters across, with immense airlock
doors to space on the southernmost side. The walls are a clean dark gray, but
the unusually high ceiling overhead is painted a soft blue as if in imitation of
a planetary sky, with an enormous royal blue and gold fleur-de-lys in the
center. The squarish contours of the bay are softened by the addition of support
struts in the corners, each one containing elaborate ironwork. Over the entrance
to the access corridor to the north is a large blue and gold banner reading:
'Bienvenue au Nouveau Quebec, Terre du Sirop et de la Poutine.'

[Starship "Distant Wanderer"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Nouveau Quebec; Docking Bay.
You see a small natural golden brown trash bin, a rare black EAOSian contoured

[Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Distant Wanderer"; Docking Bay.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved purple top with a brightly colored
dragon print, a pair of skinny blue low rise jeans, and a pair of mystic purple
suede clogs. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten
on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender
bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver
ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a soft fuchsia
Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a Tardick lizard named Asteria
perched on her shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both
hands, and waist are left uncovered.
She is carrying a sheet of blue paper in her right hand.

Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this
spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec. The straight
sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the
blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging
mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In
the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant
fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal
statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the
north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller,
somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au
Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique
des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window,
where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'

carved in a Gothic style with the images of angels and saints, some of them
unfamiliar. Images of other holy people, among them the present pope of Nouveau
Quebec, are painted in murals across the walls and around the entrances of other
high church offices here, including the Sainte Office Du Trs Saint Pape and of
the Ministre des Affaires Religieuses, while the ceiling is decorated with an

dance and parade around in glittery costumes, while an equal number of onlookers
ooh and ah from the safety of the painted sidewalks. A number of shops are open
along the wide corridor, their doorways situated among bright, glittering murals
of fantastic subjects. One such shop is called 'La Tuque' and is surrounded by
painted pictures of floating hats, and another is decorated with beautiful masks
and has a sparkly gold sign overhead reading: 'Le Masque.' Yet a third doorway
is framed with a shiny deep blue arch and has an engraved plaque on the door
reading: 'Chic Resto Pop.' Meanwhile, in competition with more established
stores, several small tents have been set up, among them 'La Joie de Chapeaux!,'

surrounding a huge blue and gold fleur-de-lys. A cart vendor loudly calls out to

This wide corridor serves as a showcase for Nouveau Quebec's artist community.
With displays of everything from vivid free-form paintings covering the original
gray metal walls to fantastic towering paper-based statues and elaborate metal
sculptures, this open-air representation of the most avant garde of artistic
expression draws locals, some of whom seem quite loudly indignant at this waste
of their tax credits, while others gaze fondly upon the creations of their
favorite artists. Still others seem to be here merely on their way to somewhere
else. The entrance to the Ministre de la Culture is here, its artfully
decorated doorway surrounded by brightly colored notices.

A great celebration seems to be going on here! Beneath colorful banners and
streamers hanging beneath a ceiling painted with a stylized night sky lit by
colored lamps, masked and costumed people have gathered here for a party. People
dance and parade around in glittery costumes, while an equal number of onlookers
ooh and ah from the safety of the painted sidewalks. A number of shops are open
along the wide corridor, their doorways situated among bright, glittering murals
of fantastic subjects. One such shop is called 'La Tuque' and is surrounded by
painted pictures of floating hats, and another is decorated with beautiful masks
and has a sparkly gold sign overhead reading: 'Le Masque.' Yet a third doorway
is framed with a shiny deep blue arch and has an engraved plaque on the door
reading: 'Chic Resto Pop.' Meanwhile, in competition with more established
stores, several small tents have been set up, among them 'La Joie de Chapeaux!,'
'Le Petit Mange,' 'Boules de Neige,' and 'L'Animal Sauvage.' Great piles of
artificial snow have been heaped up along the walls and tents like snow drifts
and seem to be among the most popular attractions here.

Down the center of this corridor is a painted path of pale orange paving stones
lined on either side with young maple trees growing straight and true from wells
of soil amid patches of grass along the path. Behind the real trees are
paintings of a forested countryside where, behind the many maple trees, the
spires of tall evergreens appear here and there against the azure blue sky.
Citizens and tourists alike stroll along, admiring the scenery and occasionally
glancing upward at the sound of trilling bird calls in the trees. The scent of

quadrants, each containing a vast area perhaps a kilometer on each side of maple
trees in various stages of growth from seedling to maturity, flourishing in
environments mimicking the four major seasons on Old Earth. Though the section
now growing in autumn conditions draws the most reverent attention from tourists
and citizens of New Quebec alike for its blaze of glorious color, the winter
section is crowded with modern machines and warmly dressed technicians

I don't know exactly where to begin. To ones who are not aware, It all began
when I had my heart broken by someone whom I dearly treasured and cherished.
People have there own ways of coping when they go under a great amount of stress
or pain. When my boyfriend let me go, I did not take it strongly as I needed to.
Instead I ran, because that was my way of coping. My way of coping was running
away from my pain. The contents of this brief account should further explain
that however. And hopefully you will have a better understanding once you have
finished reading this. One day I might write down more details of my experience
but, as for now I've not the strength. The following pages are what I wrote
while I was lost in the rift. Some pages may seem hurried, other reflective, and
some I just wrote down my thoughts because I felt scared and alone, and well, as
you will read, writing helped anchor a bit of sanity.

I did something absolutely mad. I ran away because of Ather, someone who I will
now admit to myself, sense I am all alone in the rift, that I could've possibly
loved. Mel took me away to feng wo to get away from it all. I thought it was
going to help me heal, for Feng Wo is very dear to my heart, and I saw it as a
comfort haven. I Had lots of friends whom cared about me, that went with me on
the trip. And then one day, while we were hanging out in the OBS room, these
beautiful birds carrying poutches came and made this circular stone thing, and
we thought it was an offering thing. Everybody was offering sorts of things,
some offered blood, while others offered shiny things. I offered a lock of my
hair at first, but then I offered myself to the rift. I did this because I was
teribly sad. and depressed and everything was screaming Ather to me. Mel wanted
me to throw away my amulet but I couldn't. and I got overwelmed and offered
myself to the rift. I remember going into the control room. I was quite
overwhelmed and had an unclear mind. I gazed into the rift and told it to take
me. Then an inhuman voice whispered behind my ear and asked, "You offer
yourself? I knew I could not part with my amulet, so I would go with it. So I
said to the voice, "Yes, my heart is broken. I want to fly away with you." Then
the inhuman voice said, "The deal is struck." The next moment, I was no longer
in the rift but in a place that is not really a place itself. So now I am stuck
in the rift. I don't know where I am. This is what I wanted. I am so scared,
Will I ever see Mel again? Will I ever see Ali again? I know I have probably
pissed so many people off. I imagine them being mad at my disappearance. I'm so
scared, I don't know where I am, except that I am in the rift, and I teribly
miss Mel, and I hate and want ather...

Right so In this riftscape I found myself in some sort of cave, or moonscape, or
coral rief, I could not tell. I had this dread that I would be stuck here
forever. All that was with me was a wasp. I remember calling out Mel's name, and
crying, I was so scared. And then I curled up and slept from emotional
exhaustion. I woke up again, with the wasp still there with me. At first I tried
making friends with it. I even named it Ritzy, but then I grew mad and tried to
punch it. then I tried going after it and it stung me and now everything has
changed. I am here in a fountain like thing, and I want that coin in the
fountain, but I don't want people seeing me get it though. Wow, I am not
completely and utter alone? Bad rift, it lies to me. Or is this my insane mind
speaking. I miss ather. I am glad I am away from him, I am glad I am away from
everyone. I wish I could stay here forever, or something. Mel would never
forgive me. I don't belong there anymore. All because of some stupid heart
break...why did Ather leaving me hurt so much?.

I am nowhere and somewhere again. There is a cannon. What do I do with a cannon?
I remember that before the intity took me into the rift, that we were in a
riftscape that had soldiers firing cannons. So I think that I might catch Mel
and my crew mate's attention if I shoot it. I shot the cannon, and I attracted
attention. I saw people looking at me, is it you guys? I saw your mouthes open,
and I felt slightly relieved. Maybe you guys see me somehow. But that wasn't the
case. Because the next thing that is happening is that I am being trampled. I
feel pain of being trampled. I do not know what I was thinking, it could not be
you guys, you guys would never hurt me like this. I thought that maybe it was
you guys, and that if you heard my cannon shot, that Yawl opened your mouthes in
surprise and got up and started looking for me in the ship. But then you guys
probably could not see me so you trampled over me somehow, but that doesn't make
sense. So in my bewilderment and trying to make sense of this, I am gone again,
and I look up to see that I am in a basement.

I am going mad. I want to kill this bee, but it keeps going out of my sight, it
is now on the trunk of a tree, so I am just considering how I will kill it.
While I consider, I will write down what happened in the basement. All I know is
there was this book I wanted to read. I love books, but this basement frightened
me. The book would be old and moldy to read, but I wanted it so bad. But it was
dark and cold in the basement. I finally gathered up my courage and made my way
across the dank basement. I remember the concrete floor being cold and gritty
against my bare feet. Suddenly halfway across the basement, out of nowhere the
furnace roared to life with an angry blast of heat. The sound of the roaring
furnace almost hid the sound of a door being opened that should've been locked.
I think I ran outside? Because the next thing I know is that I am outside, and
it is teribly dark again. I see a dark figure step inside. I scream, and when I
open my eyes once more, I found myself some where and nowhere again with nothing
but a hat. Bewildered, I took the hat and put it on. It was too big, and I found
my arms touching something sticky and wet. Then I was sliding out the other end,
and someone helped me up. I looked around and I saw a pencil. I've gone mad. It
was time to take my wormhole physics exam. But I had not told anyone that I
skipped the class. my whole semester. And it was time to take the class. I felt
panicked I did not want to do this, I needed some sort of escape. I was going to
fail the test, I had to do something, anything. I grabbed the pencil and stabbed
my palm. I closed my eyes in pain, and when I opened them, I found myself here,
with this bee that is after me.

While I try to escape this rift scape, I want to write, because it calms my
heart and brain. Plus the things I've had to do here is mad. fact number 1. I'm
not over ather.
Fact number too, I'm actually in the rift itself.
fact 3, In the end, this is what I wanted. Something to run away with that would
distract my mind and brain. I thought feng wo, but am I crazy for thinking that
this rift, being here in the rift is distraction enough? I am away from prying
eyes, or people, and I am away from the person who hurt me bad.
fact 4, I don't want to leave. At least, I don't want to go back to the pilot
core. I am nothing there anymore. What would Mel and nissi think if and when
they found out that I've offered myself to the rift? I could not be trusted to
be on my own. I don't think I am of any worth to the core anymore. I hope I
become a legend or a mistery, because if I go back to the core, or if the rift
forces me back to the ship, then I might consider retiring. I feel like being
out here is solitude for me. Perhaps I may find my peace out here, if I can
escape the rift, and avoid being driven mad by it. Per haps I will be okay out
here, wherever I am. Ather certainly probably wouldn't care much if of my
absence. Perhaps I will be just some crazy girl who went rogue over a heart
break over him. Perhaps I will be a piece of gossip he may speak of to another
girl he might be attracted to one day. But I certainly hope not. A part of me
wishes he will get the news that I've been taken. I know mell has noticed my
abscence by now, I am sure she has sent back a message to the QE back at home to
tell them of my abscence. I secretly hope that Ather would come out here and
save me somehow, maybe knowing something has happened to me will open up his
heart again and he will come and save me. I guess he's the only one that could
convince me to go back there. But he does not want me, so good luck with that. I
guess I still hope he will take me back and he won't shun me. but I don't know.
I'd rather stay out here than go back there to a still closed up Ather, and a
very angry core. I am sorry for doing this to Mel. I really am. That is
something I won't forgive myself for. She did all she could to help me, and I
just up and left her, and turned my back on her. But as much as I love her as my
bosom friend, something snapped inside of me and I do not wish to go back. Maybe
I have gone crazy. Maybe my heart's been broken so much that I want to be like

Ather, you were worried that the government would not take well to you. You were
worried that something would happen to you. Isn't it ironic that you're quite
alright, and I am not? If you ever read this some day, I want you to know that I
cared so much for you. The best memory was not lying in a hammock with your or
sleeping in your arms, yes those were cherished moments and I don't regret them.
The best memory was when we were at the Nightshade Cafe. And I was playing the
piano for you. I loved your jovial comments about dissecting pianos. I loved
your arm being wrapped around my waist. I can still hear the clicking of your
optic units well in the memory as you looked around the cafe. You seemed happy
and content, and I loved seeing you happy. Another happy memory was when I was
sitting in the lounge and I ketp gazing out the window, and you asked what I was
thinking, and I blurted out what I was thinking. And then I was too shy to tell
you what I was thinking of you. I miss you asking what I'm thinking. Or when you
put your hand lightly on my shoulder and asked me "A creddit for your thoughts?"
It made me blush and I was touched you cared what I was thinking. I know when I
left the lounge your words echoing in my head that you will see me again so that
I will tell you my thoughts of you, I was elated and all girlish, like wow he
wishes to know what I think of him. Another happy memory was when you took me to
288 and we got to know and learn about each other. I blushed inside when you
said you did not like sharing your women, and you winked at me. I remember
asking you what your original eye color was, because I was so enamored with you.
That was another time, from 288, but every moment spent with you was grand. Also
that night when you made me dinner. I remember that if you had your original
eyes I could've made you cry. Because you wanted to feel human and experience a
happy and wonderful relationship. That was one of the most hopeful moments of my
life. It was all grand. Maybe you letting me go because you did not think it was
fair for the both of us that you were not always around was the best. Maybe I
will learn that some day. But all I know is right now, is that it hurt me deeper
than I even knew, when you set me free. Because I waited for you so many times,
I did not give up on you. and I guess I felt like you gave up on me. And I felt
like it was so easy for you, and it hurt. It hurt because I thought I could love
you. I opened up my heart to you, the petals of my heart were tender. And you
were like the bee coming to polinate me, but I only got stung. That is so stupid
my analogy, seeing as I'm in this riftscape with this damn bee that I've been
trying to kill for several hours. Anyways, All I know is I left, because that is
what I do. I run away from things that hurt me. I wish I was as strong as you
are, and could've dealt better with it. But I didn't. I offered myself to the
rift, because I felt too broken and pained to think clearly. I wanted a means of
escape. And now I'm here. in the rift, trying to find my way through it. It is
indeed rift madness. But I write to try and keep my sanity. And maybe I am going
mad, if I think this rift is helping me not think of you so much, or feel the
pain anyways. I'm too busy trying to escape riftscape after riftscape. And you
are the only person in this galaxy who could convince me back to go to the core.
I have probably disappointed Mel, and all the people that cared about me by
doing something so selfish. But I don't think I could be okay facing my
heartbreak and facing the shame of the core if I go back there. In a way this is
rift is my release and prison. I am selfish for saying that the only way that I
could probably bare going back there is if you took me back. and I could not ask
that of you, so I won't. If you cared at all maybe you would take me back,
protect me, and keep me safe. But that piece of goodness is rare. And I'm
rambling now. But this is me. If you ever read this one day, you'll know that I
cared about you so much, that I'd've rather face the dangers and the unknown
than be apart from you. But you cut the string that tied my heart to yours, and
I am bleeding, and I am now in the unknown. And it is indeed insane that though
the rift frightens me, and it I am lost in it, it has given me some way to cope
with the pain of my heart. It distracts me, it makes me focus on my obsticles at
hand, if i am ever to find my way out of the rift. I hope you all will forgive
me one day.

I punched the bee, or tried to. But I felt the pain of the impact on my fist
against the bark of the tree, then a stinging sensation in my hand. I unclenched
my fist, and found the bee there. To my horor the angry bee flew out and dove at
me and sstung me everywhere, into my shirt, arms, all I felt is pain from it
stinging me. I wanted it to stop. I close my eyes and cried.

I cannot tell where I am. All I know is that there is a box with red stains at
the corner of the box, and it's upside down. There's a thing, a ghost inside it.
I'm teribly afraid. I know it wants to hurt me. There is someone here, he is my
friend I think. He wants to flip the box over, but I don't want him to. I can't
explain why, it's just a feeling, and he mustn't overturn the box. While I wrack
my brain on how to stop him from opening the box, all I can do is just shoot him
warning glances, and shoo him away from it, in hopes he will not change his mind
soon. My brain hurts. There is a knife here, I must stop him with it. I just
don't know how, I don't want to hurt him, though I can't say I have not tried.
Rift madness. This is my third day in the rift. I wish Euclid was here. I wish I
had his brain. I'd never give it back. Rift madness.

I've done it. I stabbed my friend, it was the only way?. I did not want him to
flip the box. I stabbed him once more, and he got his knife and stabbed me back.
Lots of pain, lots of stabbing each other. Guess the ghost didn't have to do a
thing to hurt me. I collapsed. I opened my eyes, and I still could not recognize
where I was. There was a dog, it was very wary it was growling, but I knew it
was not upset at me. I wanted to calm it. I reached out to soothe it. It stopped
growling. But as soon as I touched it, it exploded into action and tried to
attack me. Some unseen force pushed at my back and pushed me to the ground and
the dog leaped over and went into combat with the force that I could not see. I
fainted. I wake up. Now I am in a starship or something. All I know is I'm
moving towards a planet or some sorts, and I can't..I can't move to the
controls. Too many things in the way. I have to stop moving somehow, I'm moving
fast and it's horid to watch the thing on the view screen racing towards me.

I faced a couple more things after that. I remember smiling in disbelief or for
some reason, and saw black, white, then red all over. And then consciousness
returned, because I looked up and saw that I was at Outland City
Nightshade Coffeehouse. So I was out of the rift, I hoped. but I was so unsure
and shaken. I remember looking around, and was surprised. This was the place
where I had the best memories, this was the one place where I had the happiest
moments. I remember trying to call Eli so that I could go to Accord and send a
message, but could not find my phone, and remembered that I forgot to put it on
after I took a shower in Mel's ship. So I called out over general for Eli, and
people cheered and asked me if I was okay, and they seemed so happy that I was
back safe. I felt so emotional and touched then. But I wondered if they would
still react that way if they knew that I had done all of this to myself. I was
still so afraid. I went to accord and everything was so familiar and I was so
shaken. People came to the QE chamber to aprove my message. I could barely
speak, everyone was being so kind and gentle to me. A few days later I told Erik
everything that happend to me. and I was so surprised that he did not think
lesser of me for doing something so wreckless. I was still surprised that he
still cared. I was pretty sure that I would be looked down on. For the first
time then I did not feel so alone. I knew that I had to tell others the truth
though, so that is why I have written this book, because at least my crew mates
deserved to know what had become of me. I told Mel that happened, and again I
was very startled to see that she did not turn her back on me, or scoff at me
for my stupidity. It has left me touched and contrite, and I cannot explain how
much it means to me that both Erik and Mel did not turn away when they found out
the truth.

List of things I know.
1 I am still trying to cope with everything that has happened to me.
2 I know I have worried so many people, and I am teribly sorry.
3 I don't think that all of this was worth over a boy.
4 I will never do something so wreckless over a boy again
5 I believe that the rift has taught me a lesson despite what I went through.
And that is, never to run from fear and pain, but to face it. All I knew in the
rift was fear and pain, but it let me go at Nightshade cafe, where I had the
happiest moments. So maybe, if I face my fear and pain, I will find happiness?
We went to feng wo because I could not face Ather's seemingness to be alright
after letting me go. I wanted distance from him, and the pain of the heart break
I was feeling. I did not think it was wrong to go away to a comfort haven, in
belief that it would do me some good. However offering myself to the rift intity
was wreckless and was not the best idea, and was not an escape from the pain I
was feeling. I was overwhelmed and was not thinking clearly and I just wanted
some sort of escape. Though I am surprised that the intity did not choose the
ones who did offer their blood instead of me. I guess it was interested in what
I had to offer the most.

In closing I would like to say that, I do not think that what I went through in
the rift is a common thing. I believe it was a personal experience, so I cannot
say how to deal with it, if one was ever taken into the rift, because you guys
might face something completely different than I have. My advice is to not be
stupid and wreckless like I was, and offer yourself to the rift. That is all I
know how to tell you to face it. I was not forcibly taken, I offered myself.
Which is a bad idea in my opinion sense you have read of some of the things I
went through durring that time. I believe I encountered a bad faery or rift
intity that fed off of my emotions and amplified it, but I also believed that it
was trying to teach me a personal lesson. Hopefully you will never feel so low
like I did enough to do something so wreckless. Lastly I was given permition by
Mel to share the account that she had written of what happened with them after I
vanished from the ship. On the following page is her account.

On October 24, 2317, we were flying through the rift out heading for Feng Wo.
These bird creatures appeared and began to build a stone cairn in the
observation room of Nocturnal Flight. Once the birds left, pilots began to put
stuff on the cairn trying to get some communication. We offered trinkets such as
rings, hair, shiny objects. We felt some sort of deja vu when we first held the
stone that's on top of the cairn and it was warm. Nissi felt like she missed
something when she held it. Thus we wanted to know the meaning of the symbols
and purpose of the stones. Since it was Katina who came up missing, I should
mention that she placed her hair on the cairn and asked if she could have it
back if it wasn't taken.
The stone cooled off, Nissi said something about people should bleed into the
cairn. Damien Goss, Magnus Branderson, Moris Corlew, Wendy Arroyo, and Katina
Faye didn't realize she wasn't serious and offered to do it. Nissi decided to go
get supplies after, I think, Magnus asked for a knife. I think this was so that,
if people were going to do it, it would be safer, Damien and Magnus sliced their
arms and bled into the bowl. Morris Corlew, then went off for about 5 minutes to
make sample containers so that they could just be placed on top of the bowl if
people wanted to prick a finger for blood. In retrospect, allowing two pilots to
do the bloodletting into a bowl was a bad idea and I will assume responsibility
for this as it is my ship. I believe that, since we don't get many chances to
possibly learn something about rift entities, we acted quickly as there is not
always time to wait around for a proper science team to investigate.
It was after Morris left to make sample containers that a face was seen in the
trench wall of a war scene from the rift. Katina Faye exited the observation
room at that point. We soon discovered she was not aboard the ship. We then
notified home and stopped in at Feng Wo and asked after her. We had no luck
there and headed into the rift for clues. We were asked by someone at the Accord
how she disappeared and what our plan of action was, to which we responded that
she walked out of observation and just disappeared, and that our plan was to
look around Feng Wo space for any clues. We had discussed that we may have to
head home and attempt to discuss this with EAOS if we did not find any clues
fairly soon.
In regards to the Feng Wo stop, on October 25, we asked a representative there
if they had seen her. She was given a photo and they did put up a missing person
poster for us. After that is when we decided to go back into the rift and the
hallucinations occured.
On the 26th, myself and other pilots had some visions of probably our inner
thoughts. It began with Morris seeing things moving and photographs staring at
him. At one point, a box of alcohol a crewmember had brought aboard tipped and a
bottle of absinthe rolled across the floor to land at his feet. most Everyone
who drank the absinthe had some sort of vision, Morris saw an overturned
cardboard box and a knife in a photo, I spoke to what I believe to have been my
subconscious, Wendy spoke to an aquaintance she met recently, and Tobias spoke
to an unknown person, although it appeared to us that he was speaking to another
crewmember. From these, we deduced that Katina was hiding as she initially
wanted to do and that she had to fix whatever the rift did to her by not wanting
to hide. Or we'd need to find some clue as to how we could help her.
While I don't know everything the other pilots heard or saw, with my
hallucination, I theorized that Katina was where she wanted to be. That she was
hiding and some crazy way, got assistance from the rift. Thus we tried to relax
in case she somehow was still near and continued to look and hope till we saw
her on comms. Prior to that, we were just all frantic with worry.
After the hallucinations, we had a discussion and deduced the following. The box
was a symbol of her hiding, alone and the knife was that of the box needing cut
open. Meaning, we needed to try some tough love to get her to snap out of this
behavior of running and hiding because it just isn't healthy. These things
coupled with myself saying she is where she wanted to be helped us piece this
tough love thought together. There was something in Wendy's halucination about
we are not searching for the right thing. We have the answers with not the right
questions. So we had discussed these things and came up with our thoughts on how
to handle it going forward. Which, I have stated.
My halucination was as follows. I said to myself that I am tired of having to
explain everything to these pilots, even if I am right. That they need to learn
things for themselves and I am tired of being mom. This was the reason that I
deduced it was my conscience because I am probably helpful to a fault. I believe
that I asked myself, after saying oh wow or something, where is Katina. I then
got the answer that she is where she wants to be. From conversations I had with
her prior to her disappearance, I knew she wanted to run away and hide when
problems or her love life drama became too much for her to handle. I had tried
to explain to her that she cannot continue running and then this rift
disappearance happened several hours later.
On the 27th, we noticed that Katina was showing up at home on the communicator.
She sent us a QE that she was safe. Since we were close to the Buddha, we
decided to stop there before returning home. We described the things that
happened to a few of the workers out there. I gave a mostly exact copy of this
letter to father Paul and we headed out for home.

--
Star Conquest Help: POSE Command
--
Category: Communication
--
The POSE command is similar to EMOTE in that it helps you depict your
character's body language. Unlike an emote, however, a pose lasts until you
cancel it, and anyone entering or looking at the room will see your current
pose. This pose will also show up if someone takes your photograph.
In the same way that SIT CHAIR will depict your character sitting in a chair,
using a pose will depict your character in a certain way until you change it.
You may want your character leaning against a wall, or eyeing everyone who
enters the room, or working on a sketch. Anything that makes sense for your
character is fair game!
To use the command, simply type POSE. It will present you with a list of preset
options. You may also choose to write a custom pose by choosing option #1 from
the menu.
You can also set your pose in one command, simply by typing POSE followed by
whatever you would like your pose to be. You can cancel your pose quickly by
typing POSE CANCEL. If your pose involves sitting or lying down, standing up
will cancel it automatically.
Keep in mind that all poses are in the form of "[name] is [doing a pose]." So,
for example:
Right: pose leaning against the wall.
What Others See: Jim is leaning against the wall.
Wrong: pose leans against the wall.
What Others See: Jim is leans against the wall.

When dealing with the stations and firing at incoming asteroids that are on a
path to hit X station. Is it just small rocks or can the chunks be Grenwold
sized? Are Grenwold sized chunks too much for the station to handle?

This wide corridor serves as a showcase for Nouveau Quebec's artist community.
With displays of everything from vivid free-form paintings covering the original
gray metal walls to fantastic towering paper-based statues and elaborate metal
sculptures, this open-air representation of the most avant garde of artistic
expression draws locals, some of whom seem quite loudly indignant at this waste
of their tax credits, while others gaze fondly upon the creations of their
favorite artists. Still others seem to be here merely on their way to somewhere
else. The entrance to the Ministre de la Culture is here, its artfully
decorated doorway surrounded by brightly colored notices.

[Nouveau Quebec; Tree District]
The north end of Liberty Avenue is here amid a painted forest of maple trees
presented in every season across the vertical metal walls. Flanking the entrance
of the Ministry of Trees here are two especially beautiful trees, their leafy
green boughs overhanging the doorway. At the apex of the domed ceiling is the
sun, a great round yellow lamp with wavy streamers of solar flares painted
around it. Wide corridors lead away to the northeast and northwest, each with an
elaborate metalwork sign overhead, though the largest and most imposing sign
hangs over the arched entrance to an area to the north whence come the rustle of
leaves, the sound of bird calls, and the faint scent of maple syrup. A harrowing
ladder leads up to another chamber.

Down the center of this corridor is a painted path of pale orange paving stones
lined on either side with young maple trees growing straight and true from wells
of soil amid patches of grass along the path. Behind the real trees are
paintings of a forested countryside where, behind the many maple trees, the
spires of tall evergreens appear here and there against the azure blue sky.
Citizens and tourists alike stroll along, admiring the scenery and occasionally
glancing upward at the sound of trilling bird calls in the trees. The scent of
maple syrup fills the air, courtesy of a small cart at the side of the path
where maple-flavored treats are sold.

calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a stretchy long-sleeved white top with a colorful butterfly
print, a silky fringed white sash embroidered with white stars, a pair of tight
light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left
pocket, and a pair of white leather clogs with a row of glittery fireflies
across the toes. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid
silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria. Her
head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

Hello, this is for those of you who went to NQ with me. I just wanted to remind
you all that I'm leaving at 1400 hours Friday, tomorrow. I would appreciate it
if you could all please camp out in my carrier tonight, so I will be assured
that I will not be leaving you behind. This is for acomedations, since I am
aware that people have different sleeping hours. For those of you who have ships
docked in my bay, please leave me a note on the coffee table in my control room
before you go to bed telling me that you guys are in your ship and on board.
That way in the morning, I will read it and would count you present. If I do not
see a note from you, and do not see you on board, I will undock your ship, and
you will have to fly your ship back yourself. I'd very much like to avoid
leaving with your ship docked, and without you in it. For those of you who do
not have a ship to take you back, and I do not see you on board by departure
time, you will have to take the spacebus back whenever you wake up and have the
chance. I'll be glad to give you a lift back through the skim when you arrive,
if I am around then. If not I'm sure someone else would be happy to give you a
hand as well. But I'm hoping that won't happen and departure from NQ will go
smoothely, which is why I'm posting this. Thank you so much for joining me, I
hope you guys have enjoyed your time here.
