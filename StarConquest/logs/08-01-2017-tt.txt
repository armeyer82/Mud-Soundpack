Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
power
You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
launch
You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock
clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits with a laugh, "Is that like a
mall or just some really big planet I'm like as not to get lost in?"

ftl chetumal
What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an
alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny
station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the
Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order
is entered."
Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm!
Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

Saira Sorrenson
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has sun-kissed tawny skin. Her body is delicate with sensually curved hips and
shapely calves. She has lissome shoulders and pert breasts. Her face is
symmetrically ovular and high cheekboned, with an aquiline nose and gently
rounded chin. Her lips are full and pomegranate red and occasionally part to
reveal a set of even, white teeth. Beneath a set of gracefully arched eyebrows,
her eyes are slate blue and heavy-lidded. Her waist-length, silky hair is russet
and teased into loosely flowing waves down her back. She has meticulously
manicured light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a black velvet beret, a long black sleeveless silk dress, an
expensive platinum watch with sapphire accents, a silvery gray silk sash, and a
pair of black jelly ballet flats with a matching bow. She is also wearing a fine
gold link necklace with a light-catching red crystal teardrop pendant, a pair of
shimmering red crystal drop earrings, and a glittering red crystal bracelet. Her
face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, left wrist, and
both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large suitcase in her right hand.

You stand at the apex of Ixtapa, a city of cement ramps and plasteel towers,
with a greater height than width. The rails along the edge of the hexagonal apex
form a rather inadequate windbreak, and the force of the wind continually pushes
you against other people and into various immobile objects. Teenagers accelerate
past you on reactionless footjets, braking abruptly in front of stores or
apartments, or skimming at reckless speeds down ramps leading to lower levels. A
section of missing rail to the east turns out, upon careful examination, to lead
to a steep ramp.

Considered to be the hub of the spaceport, this circular area is nearly always
crowded with travelers, traders, and pilots from all parts of known space.
Though the area is neither large nor well lit, it is impressive in its own way.
Beyond the people milling about, the dark gray metal walls gleam in the low
light, with doorways framed in brushed black metal leading to adjoining shops
and services, including a bar to the southeast advertised by a garish orange
neon sign over the entrance. Strong steel beams with triangular cutouts follow
the curve of the wall upward, meeting overhead in an array of sleek monitors
displaying the news of the day. Main corridors extend away from the hub to the
north, east, south, and west, and near the west corridor, wide ramps lead up and
down to other levels of the spaceport. Around the perimeter of the ceiling is a
circular DISPLAY that you can READ for directions to various areas in the

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Six heavy fighters in
the area, the disabled pod is on the other side of the sector."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can do it!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Imagine how much
more scary it will be when you're getting actual artifacts and you have to leave
your ship to get them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still wonder
what would happen if a RAT caught up to me while I was on a spacewalk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hopefully you're
not wearing a metal belt buckle, should that happen."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "There is a LOT of
debris in this area.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "If this nest isn't
taken care of, there'll be tons of RATs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im counting at least
ten chunks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm. Where is
that nest?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do want to do
a nest before this conquest ends."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Two sectors west of
the old frontier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Argh, rats near
our beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Again? I just
cleared out a good chunk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is a nest,
they sort of propagate from them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Those things replicate
like crazy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though, I
imagine by the time I could assemble a crew to destroy it, they might have
consumed the debris and moved on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, Im clear. Theyl
eft me alone, suprisingly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's good.
They're actually sort of slow. As long as you don't start very close to any you
should be able to pull artifacts from nest sectors without too much trouble."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been hit by
drills a few times doing it, but I've never been too badly banged up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Shoulda seen the five
pirates I had to deal with in 777. I kept using the watch towers laser on them
and they warped out one by one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow. Did
they interdict the sector?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Don't think so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, it's good
that you ran them off."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Too many people
use 777 to let pirates hang around."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much
industry did you get doing all that salvage?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Won't know until the
storage container is brought to a starport."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, did you not
eject the container before you left?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nope, Should I have?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, when
you're done salvaging you should leave your ship, go upstairs to the control
center, and eject the module."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry, I should
have told you that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Orion's the same
way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's okay,
you'll still get the points. The processor isn't going down any time soon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If I got out
there later I'll eject it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "If you go now the rift
was flowing towards 777. Its why my return trip was so bad long."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Might have changed by
now though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, either way
it will be a longish trip. I'll do it after I sleep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I think I'm in
heaven."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What makes you
think that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean it's
great that you do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've come across a
wonderful onsen and the food is great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ooh, nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where is that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I've
seen that but I can't remember."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that on
Hyperion?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's in Jacktown on
Hyperion, yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The scout has such a
strong battery.. eighteen hours.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's
awesome."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Slap a feinstein
sink and you get over a day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When I first
qualified for that I used it and burned about 800 sectors straight out into
space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't do that.
It was so boring coming back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im not too far off
from getting the Mutality deep space charger."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We gotta clear
the vents then!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll try to get
a crew together tomorrow just after midnight. We'll need your plasma suit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That station
actually sells a bunch of good stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I changed back to the
AEU suit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I don't mind changing
again though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's
what the fund's there for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "What's this plasma
suit?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you don't
mind the inconvenience, that is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which there is
one, I get that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "EAOS."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "EAOS's style
battlesuit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Has a plasma cannon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That sounds pretty
nice. I'll look into it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's great for
fighting bari, and sort of regular at fighting other stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Won't have any repair
options."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Which is why I changed
back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The AEU and
rental suits are really good for doing low deployments."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Alright, on my way
back to new earth."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Still want that
beacon, Dakhal?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sure, I was just
enjoying the Sea of Grass. I'll head my way to New Phoenix."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eeeeve."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How are you?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not so bad, how's
you?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Vernos."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Vernos, you want
to do any gunship beacons?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Was actually
considering some sleep."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nicolette?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "What?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "You want to fight me
now?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Be advised of a
package report. The packages located on a certain ship have changed. The
packages are safe, but may require careful handling."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Well that certainly
narrows it down."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "The packages in
question. Are located on I'll save you. I suppose. Handle with care."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Before I sleep, what
type of credits does that toll station to 777 charge, Con?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "EAOS."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's 5 million."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I need a new
metacomm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What makes you
say that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'm not a fan of
neon green. It's a rather intrusive color."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Mines a nice ice
blue."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well I've always
thought the watch one could be cool."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah, I have
an ice blue and it has really grown on me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Anyway. Time to
sleep!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good night!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Aaannnd the drop."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Not as bad as the
drop pods used with battlesuits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I tought you
were going to say "Hey eli! " for a second constantine, and that would have
settled it. You're psychic."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How are you?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's up party
people."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Everyone. If you were
having fun, stop now. Eli's awake."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm alright,
I seem to have fallen asleep in my ship."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That happens to
me all the time."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "One of these days, I'm
going to fall asleep on accident and wake up to discover that everyone left to
go find the Jinu aboard the Lowell."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Bobbleheads. I'm
leaving now before I get the idea of putting them on my console."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. That's
planned...what is it. 35.6 days away from now. in 1.5 grand cycles."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You totally
should. I have a Jinu one in my fighter I bring for luck."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Somehow I doubt it Eve,
considering I was at the meeting where we voted to do that, and that was years
ago."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not what sure what the
hold up has been."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach sighs. "Killjoy."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The vote was between
going to see if we can re-establish contact with the Jinu, or to attempt to make
real contact with the IFS. The vote was to find the Jinu and even though I voted
that way, I often felt like we should have done the other."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When was this?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So I guess, in a way,
it's a good thing that it hasn't gotten off the ground?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like, years ago. 3 or 4
years ago?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. Eli...I was just
kidding around. Damn it. where did your humor go?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, huh. Nothing ever
happened?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "My humor is still
asleep."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli's humor, wake the
blue damn fuck up."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No it never happened,
or rather, hasn't happened yet. I'm sure there's a lot of ligistics to work
out."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This was before the new
Accord station even opened, the meeting was held on the old one."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Eli, what do
we use on tactical platforms for exploration?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sightseers,
or long-ranged sightseers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "These bo'h have
exploration@g;ade s/\sors?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Preferably
the long-ranged ones, but those are application only."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, they are
sold at Hermes communications locations. The places where you buy passenger
ships like the taxi."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So um. To any of you
felo-liking people. I'm looking to move some white soldiers. And maybe some
beautiful golden humming felo. Or talkers as they're called. If you want some
and you are not. A cadet. Give me a shout."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Mean hummers?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't catch 100^ +>
that,'but if they hum that\"-^ld be =ool}"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I have mean humming
felo, but I'm not moving those."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I want my blue glowing
one."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Uh oh,m Little blue
heard me, he just came in and gave me the death glare."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm working on it.
Sanity man, have patience. I don't actually give birth to the things."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This is a good thing
Evenia."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is. After I said
that, I got a super creepy image."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I hope none of your
telepathic ones are around, they might have gotten tha timage to. Did any of
them give you a really awkward look?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sorry, I didn't catch all
of that. You have singing felo?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs. "No."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aww, okay."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought you just said
you did?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah dude, I got a
ship full of them."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I meant. No Eli. Yes
con."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Amazing."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't believe I have
gotten no mail today. This is amazing."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I haven't either,
it's sad."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There you go Eve."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh dear."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So Constantine. You
interested in one of these lovely and sweet, singing felo?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Really? You're not
going to comment on my package?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I only have gold
though, is that an issue?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Um.. ok that came out
wrong."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chortles.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're golden in color?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, that's great."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I was showing
Nicolette my mean humming felo."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "How'd that fight turn
out?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It hasn't happened
yet."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It could though."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Right, little mis
thinks I'm scared to fight her. Be at earth if you wanna see this."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "We will be delighted
to bring you into the gym to watch. All are welcome."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And constantine, I'll
get your pet after I wipe the floor with her."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn she's eager too.
She's hauling ass in that capsule of hers."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sphere will remain in
my ship, to keep it fair."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So wait, what fight is
happening."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was skimming."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Look out Even, she just
shoved past me. She's coming for ya."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. Me and Nicolette
decided we'd fight yesterday for...some reason or other."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She's got tha tmean
look on her face."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, yeah I'll watch that."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Get ya butt to earth
then."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm already here, I'm
outside the gym."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Don't tell people to get
here when you're not even here yourself."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is when she says."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm all around you!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And appears from inside
the punching bag."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So is Constantine.
Everyone is ready for the early morning entertainment."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I won."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So did not."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did you? It kinda
seemed like neither of you did."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I did."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey applauds sedately.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Raul."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Welcome to the
corps!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I just got snatched."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why do I get the
feeling that we're missing the best part?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "What, us both laying
in medical?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, right. Nevermind."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Now um, who said
beacons?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I like that."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You can't bow out
now."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Clippers?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "We just gave you
amazing entertainment."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Why don't we grab one
more with Nicolette, and take up a gunship of some kind?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "No bowing out now."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I'm headed over
there now."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Over where? There are
plenty of places."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have a
gunship, Eli?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I guess I
misunderstoood."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm so confused."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll jump back."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "My suggestion was.
That we find one more with Nicolette. And take up some form of gunship."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I went back to Old Earth."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I just assumed that you
still meant one of ours."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm at old earth as
well."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Since we initially were
talking about clippers."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh shit yeah. One of
your ships. I don't even have a gunship."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Never bothered buying
one, since I couldn't fly the thing."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, so before we tear
anymore holes in space to travel around, let's be clear on what's going on."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I will go back to New
Earth and get on your gunship, Eli."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Right. Meeting at new
earth then."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We'll be back to pick
you ladies up."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh, how kind."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well um, unless you
want to come over here, don't ask me I just work here."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Come pick us up. We
just battled for your entertainment."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Am I fixing all the
things?"
[General Communication] Top Gun Nicolette Lawrence assaults your ears with a
burst of static and screeching feedback as she transmits at the top of her
lungs, "BIG HARRY'S MONKEY WAFFLE HOUSE!"
[Tactical Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We got one extra spot
for a Pulsar beacon if anyone is awake."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Hello!"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Luja!"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained
8,703,703.70 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU
Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person pulsar
"Black Sunshine".
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So...does that mean
in some cases, size does matter?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh and eli, it's the
accelerator that goes down first at the bubble. 15 hours from now."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know I went to go
check it earlier, remember?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh yeah. I am
officially being completely unhelpful then."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Y ou said "get outta
here you glowing blue fuck and go check your stations!" and I ran away, I'm not
sure how you don't remember this."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I never did! He
lies!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Eviction notice? Waht
the hell is this shit?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I just paid the rent
like two months ago."
[General Communication] "Have you paid your rent?" Evenia an Eachtrannach
laughs. "It's the first of the month."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "That was strict!"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh damn Luja, I hope I
can catch a hug before you head out tomorrow."
[General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "Yeah!"

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Aeu."

close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits ponderously, "Is there some
sensor in this ship I might be able to use to scan what debris is before going
after it? I'm after bari corpses, but all I get are rocks.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits in a trembling voice drawn
taught with evident pain, "Erm, is there a button or something I can use to

looking?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Meh. Not so great.
I'm just salvaging now, but that doesn't seem to bring in many industry points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The higher grade stuff
means more points. I just dropped off a load worth 1.6 Million and six points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira Sorrenson transmits, "Yikes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So as you get more
points in industry and upgrade your salvage rapple and gear, it'll get faster."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Lexie tells jokes all the
time. Sometimes they don't even rhyme. On general she shouts, the rest of us
pout, and wish Fringe would give her a fine."

has 45,000 units of cargo storage."

cool."

the one I had about eli."

Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

 You are wearing a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt, a pair of slim
Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this,
you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are
also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black
leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold
wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL
communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology
container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera
bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star
on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large
pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both
wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying nothing.
Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather captain's chair.)
who
There appear to be about 14 pilots recently active.
The communicator network detects:
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey  (A) [g]
Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident  (A) [m]

Atticus Bridger  (L) [c]
Sean Sloan  (L)
Jada Nelson  (L)
Johann Schraft  (L)
Ali Candan  (L)
Gonzales Bourne  (F)
Evenia an Eachtrannach  (F)
Your communicator also reports that there are 4 pilots who were active but
dropped out of communications.
Additionally, there are 13 pilots who appear to have their communicators on but
have not recently been active.
Final total: 27 pilots.

Help on: Sight-commands
-----------------------
In recent months, a large number of visually impaired players have joined Star
Conquest, and in order to make the game more comfortable and accessible for
them, we have added a few very helpful commands that many other players may also
find extremely useful.
SIGHT (S I G H T): The SIGHT command has actually been a part of the game for a
couple of years. Basically this command removes the 'visual' element from
starmaps, screening out a lot of the gibberish that serves only to annoy and
distract visually impaired players while their screen readers frantically recite
dozens of dashes. It also does things like remove all but the ships you have
keys to from the TRANSPORT menu in garages so that screen readers aren't
scrambling to recite five million ship names. Most recently, this command also
adjusts damage reports in starships to only list the damaged components,
eliminating unnecessary extra spam. Overall, this is a very handy command.
BRIEF (B R I E F):  The BRIEF command makes it so that when you're walking
around, room descriptions will not be displayed unless you specifically request
to see it by using the LOOK command.
FOCUS (F O C U S): The FOCUS command is a combat command which allows you to
focus on a single ship during combat instead of getting a huge list of ships to
sort through. You'll be given a list of ships to choose from, and your weapons
room will focus on that ship until you either use the FOCUS command again, or
until the ship has been destroyed.
QUIET (Q U I E T): Finally, the QUIET command, though not specifically intended
for blind players, is very helpful in cutting out starship spam. This command
will only work in the starship you're currently in, and only in the control
room. The starship will stay in quiet mode until you change it.
We hope these commands are helpful to our visually impaired players. We ask that
our other players be understanding. If you come across a player who spells
things very oddly, it's likely not their fault as they can't see the letters and
can only hear how the words sound. Helping them in private with spelling can be
very beneficial to everyone, as long as you do it nicely.

user is floating above the target's hull. The charges on display seem to be
nearly featureless discs covered with a thick plastic coating, with a magnetic
pad on one side. Some are shaped to intensify damage done to a specific
component, or unshaped in order to simply affect whichever component is closest.

moon so hostile that even a spacesuited human cannot survive. It was discovered
that this moon, dubbed Teslaworld, was permeated with tunnels filled with
valuable mineral deposits, as well as a large number of artifacts from some
alien species who had occupied the moon previously. Now, Teslaworld is explored

human members of the EAOS wanted simple souveniers to give to their friends and
family, and decided upon plastic models of the Torus. However, unable to
sufficiently communicate their ideas to the alien EAOS members, they ended up
with simple discs instead. This explanation seems rather unlikely; but still,
the plastic discs endure.

of elk. All HyperTea locations are hyperspatially linked, allowing you to
interact with people and objects regardless of what HyperTea they're in.

This is where people from all over the First Thirty come to get their motionless

human members of the EAOS wanted simple souveniers to give to their friends and
family, and decided upon plastic models of the Torus. However, unable to
sufficiently communicate their ideas to the alien EAOS members, they ended up
with simple discs instead. This explanation seems rather unlikely; but still,
the plastic discs endure.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

Help on: Meetings

Meeting Policies
----------------
   Meetings in Star Conquest, as described here, are in-character gatherings of
players, to discuss the storyline, choose a course of action, or change alliance
policy.  Most are announced ahead of time, though not necessarily via a means
requiring host intervention.  They are often considered IC events, even when
involving only players, and policy dictates that participants act as such.
   During a meeting, some may wish to alter alliance policy or decide on some
major course of action.  This will require a vote, and there are certain
requirements in place which a vote must meet to result in an official decision:
     * A motion to be voted upon must be explicitly put forth and then seconded.
     * A quorum is five players of each alliance for which a decision is being
made.  (If an alliance has fewer than nine members, a quorum is three.)  Each
player's character must have existed for 10 days or more to be considered part
of a quorum.  A quorum of four may be approved with a vote, with power to veto
awarded to the alliance leader as well as any other alliances present.
     * An official representative (leader or diplomat) from each alliance for
which a decision is being made must witness the vote.  This representative has
power of veto.
     * A reasonable time must exist since any other vote involving the same
issue.
   Although players may call any vote they wish, no official decision will be
reached nor any official action taken until and unless a vote occurs with these
requirements fulfilled.
   Also note that representatives are real human beings and may not be able to
attend for OOC reasons, or may also be unavailable for IC reasons.  If this is
the case, the caller of the meeting may cancel, reschedule, or go without;
however, the requirements above are always in place.  Representatives are not
required in order to meet, but only to hold an official vote.
   The caller of the meeting may also choose to have whatever information he or
she wishes placed in the orders of all involved alliances.  Other methods of
spreading the word are generally left up to the player.  However, if a
representative is present, that representative may send a reminder over the comm
at the time of the meeting.
   Any player is allowed to request a meeting; there are no requirements based
on age or points.  However, a request may be denied for any IC or OOC reason. 
If you wish to request a meeting, please type MEETING-REQUEST.

Three-Dimensional Space
   Many players are familiar with Star Conquest's old 2D space, which was
represented solely by what is now the X-Y map.  This help file is intended to
acclimate these older players to the new third axis, and to give new players the
basics of navigation.
   First, although 3D space can of course be visualized in any orientation, one
specific orientation is emphasized by the game to simplify navigation.  Many
find it helpful to think of it like this:
     1. Your Z-coordinate ("height" on the X-Z map) is your "level."  Every
other point in space with the same Z-coordinate is on your level.  Incidentally,
each level is equivalent to the old 2D starmap.
     2. Now imagine ten such levels, stacked one atop the other.  The X-Y map,
then, looks "down" upon this stack from the top.  Each level is, of course,
transparent, until an object blocks everything directly below it.  Thus, you are
looking down through all ten levels.  Your numeric keypad moves you in any of
the eight compass directions on this level.
     3. The X-Z map shows this same stack from one side, oriented toward the
Y-axis.  It might be useful to use this map simply to determine which level you
are on, and then use the X-Y map to determine where you are on that level.

does have power."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh crap."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Pirate bolt thrower
and two scouts at 777, and they've left interdictors in the area."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Eli?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Do interdictors stop
me from using the rift accelerator?"
You have been idle for an extended period of time.  Please do something in order

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They will
yes, if you have to land on a temp atation."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or you can
try to take out the interdictors yourself. I'm coming though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'd go for it if I had
upgraded my transports hull, but I havent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well the
interdictors don't take many hits themselves, but it's fine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Was about to
come tug that one out anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Chased one of them out
with the watch tower's lasers."

minutes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't
actually fight off the pirates though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Would it be possible
to dock a couple of FTL-less fighters at the recharge rest station? Could use
them to defend the area against these guys."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That would be
tricky, those stations are only temporary and have to be replaced everyso
often."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So if they go
down with fighters inside, the fighters will be ejcted into space with no one on
them and be easy picking."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The recharge rest
station had like, twenty days of life span last I checked."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's why I suggested
that one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, but it's
still tricky to have to redock the fighters when the station goes down. It's not
a bad idea, just a tricky one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "These Lasers aren't
that strong, are they?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're
decent, it's that there's only one turret."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The short
ranged ones are actually quite strong."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wow, so he's kind of
hard to perdict too. A dangerous enemy but capable ally."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like he stole

it to children."

happy!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wouldn't
exactly call him an ally, but yeah, /e's helped turn the tide of a battle or
two."

couldn't find a beacon for it on my list."

that?"

of great salvaging."

consider doing more of that."

old one."

label it."

frustrated, but..."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Not enough coffee?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So supposing I rift back
manually, how do I know when to drop out?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "You will need to make an
approach to the beacon."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do I just monitor the
locations until I see the Mir beacon? Will that show up?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yeah, it's just like making
your approach anywhere, you will see the beacon, and probably a couple temp
beacons."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

in Zero-g? Its space.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, are you
talking about having no artificial gravity in your ship?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Artificial gravity,
I'm speaking. Turns out ships are programmed to throw a fit if you try."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't know
you could control that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "You can trip the
breaker for the gravity to float around inside."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hah, what did your
ship say?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't speak
machine. But I imagine it was a slur of obscenities."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oof. Okay, I don't
recommend tripping that breaker. The fall down to the deck is really difficult
to predict."

handily, I'll have it up in about three minutes."

you guys make it, I'll be there to label it. I just can't remember if it's alpha
or beta."

folks were still in their meeting. The longest meeting ever known."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Sure, I can switch to
an EAOS suit if needed."

question constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I need a couple
suits to go into the vents."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, if you
give me a bit I might be able to help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be
great."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sorry, I might have
missed some things. I was having a scuffle with a trio of fighters."

enough crew though, go on without me."

about vents?"

we're going to try and tackle them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You have a
repair suit, right? Do you have regenerate?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Do I got time to take
my scout to the old frontier drydock? Got to buy a new battery."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can't dock
there until we clear the vents."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You won't be
able to dock."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's one
reason we need to clear the vents."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, I see. That's

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Alright then!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "So what do we have
currently? I can get a plasma suit if needed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I will
have you do that, if you don't mind."

should, that's what it's there for."

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I didn't get the
battle of mir curse today. This makes me happy."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is that when you get a
salvage mission in battle of mir and it sucks because there's so few chunks in
each sector?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man, I hate that."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It's a total bitch
for the IFS wrecks."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah it is."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Why?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, nevermind."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. Because there's
shipwrecks around there. And there's only one chunk in each sector. So it takes
you like...10 sectors at least."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Only thing I've ever found
out there are gloves of spacemen not to be seen again."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Granted, I've not poked
around much."

could get that merchant-grade storage compression system..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rhino would have 59500
units of cargo space with it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd like to find
anything but asteroids when I'm out salvaging, myself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Whats the best grapple
you can get?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The biggest I
had before I got rogued was mighty grapple XI."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can buy
grapples with grades over 100, but I've only ever seen one chunk with a grade
higher than 60."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I haven't
spent the money to upgrade to that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Things with
that high of a grade are like, way out of comms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figure
they're for doing salvage ops out in deep space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which I 100%
want to do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I saw a field
of alien shipwrecks that was grade 100 but it was like 500 lightyears out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I believe it
was called the Veil of Rage."

That's a few days at least isn't it?"

of power?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are ship
upgrades that generate power."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The ship we
were in had plenty of charge, and a blast furnace."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah If I got the revo
battery my scout would have thirty hours of charge, I believe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have the
Feinstein battery on mine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A feinstein
battery will double a ships cahrge, as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er
Fienstein."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's honestly
overkill though, I'm not going on any two day artifacting trips."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe someday I
will."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oops, I meant the
feinstein battery, yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Before we had
temp stations. I used to just go capm out in the Radio bubble for a couple of
days heh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any
good use for that Hyperion battery?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Look at its max
speed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Gotta go fast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not that I'm
aware of, I'm sure there is somehow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right, but I
don't think we have any engines that are that fast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Umm.. Look at the
engines on the AEU book."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, but
none of our engines will go over 6000."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, the
fastest one is 6000."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh. Starting out you
mean?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So the benefit
of the 8000 is wasted for some pretty hefy drawbacks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's all
the battery matters for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe Best is
toiling away developing new engine tech for us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So the extra
speed capacity is wasted. I've often wondered if that extra capacity can't be
utilized somehow though, perhaps having that extra does something, I've just
never been able to figure out what."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, what suit
do you want me to bring Constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "EAOS 5
perhaps?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or do you
need a League?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Dakhal and I are in
EAOS-1."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We do need a
league or a repair."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm in a league
2 currently, but a 3 might be much safer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you use that,
I'll repair."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or if you want
to repair, we can brace it with the League 2."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'll bring a
League 5."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'll
switch to AEU then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If that's
alright? I'm not as good at repairing? I bet we could get Evenia to come along
too, she's pretty good at repairing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, that's fine.
Sure, we can ask her. The four of us should be more than enough, though, I
think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right on."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity, the rats."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Time to roast bari
with Plasma! Any tips for dealing with the bari?"
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Lots of rats today, yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's fairly
straightforward, basically they're resistant to everything but sonics and
plasma."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think worker
hordes are fine to use lasers on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So do that to
kind of conserve your energy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Everything else
you'll want to use arc on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Alright. I happen to
have a full stock of energy bottles."

befuddles me the most, is how you snatched that whole space warehouse without
anyone even noticing."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Windflight", the one-person flitter "Roundabout",
and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.

[Starship "Raging Seas"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone

such."

are considered at each paycheck, I'm assuming."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which can really
mess you up. You can end up with all the ore going to one processor."

three thousand unused metal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Because when I
suspect an attack is imminent during my building phase, I try to spend down to

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I give you
mad props for taking on pirates in a hauler."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's
hardcore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I know you
weren't really trying to fight them, but that was pretty rough going for the
interdictors while under fire."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "Well, I had to put Rhino through her paces."
Tara Flores laughs. "Wnated to see how her new armor plating would hold up.'"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah. They picked up
on what I was doing and knocked out my sensors, then my turret."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I swear that bolt
thrower is the one I chased off in 777."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "RATS are gone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks. I'm in a
sector to the east. Some sizeable comets here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It might have
been the same Thrower, for sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The pirates
will often jump out before their ships explode, so it's not uncommon to run into
the same ones, over and over until someone gets lucky and takes out a ship
before it can jump."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Do only the pirates
have access to bolt throwers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, they're
available on Endymion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Sounds like prime
equipment for keeping them in the system."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And once you
have enough points, you can actually install the bolt cannons on anything, save
one or two exceptions I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, no it
won't keep them there. They use temp drives just like we do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. ok, I
take that back. It is possible to hit them with a bolt and cause their drive to
seize for a moment, in which case they won't be able to amke even the temp
jump."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Always have a
temp drive bolted in your engineering room. I know some folks like to wait until
they need them, but there's not really a reason to do that. I just always have
one bolted,  just in case."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Temp drives aren't
used unless they're needed, yeah?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, I
didn't even stop to check out that outfit you mentioned, Tara."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "I guess I should figure out
something to do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I think that the
torps they've been selling me just aren't all that great. Heavy fighters take
two, but I've heard that they should really only take one."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Okay, that's just
scary."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sitting here drinking
ale and eating nachos just isn't cutting it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's scary, Eve?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I was just about to
say the same fuckin' thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It might be the
launcher and not the torps."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Have you
upgraded it at all?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What does strength
effect? On grapples?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The higher the
grapple strength, the faster the chunk will fall apart into pieces."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's my favorite
grapple characteristic."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I basically only
use mighty grapples."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, so you can then
salvage the smaller parts with the EMM?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hmmmm. I've been using
fine toothed grapples. I think fine tooth is good for things like comets, but
mighty is good for shipwrecks."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Johann."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "He just crashed for
the day. Can I help you with something?"
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, if you see him tell him I
probably wont be able to make it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Ah damn."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I suggested you,
myself."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "As much as I want to go I'll
probably be busy that day."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well. The trip will
be out for more than just a day. It's a proper exploration trip. As long as they
can get you on the ship..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's ok
if you are asleep for parts of it, those trips can run for oever a week a lot of
the time."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah. We'll see! Might be able
to get aboard on friday, or early saturday."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Johann would send you
a key, so that you could board early."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Three hundred
industry!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys want to
do anything?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Gladly?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe a nest?
The rats have sort of been a thorn in our side tonight."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, im about to buy
some stuff at the torus."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nest?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Are you saying that
you're somehow fertile, and are looking for a nesting partner?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, no."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I mean I wish I could say
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So, no nest for
us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are
beacons, tesla sites."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I could go for a
beacon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright,
beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im up for a becon.
Wheres the autovector sold on the torus, though?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Look in the
xenology research thingamabob place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forget its
true name."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's the right name."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's located in
the northeast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's the
right name."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's called
the xenology thingamabob place."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "For all your
thingamabob needs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They also sell
hot dogs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Darn I don't have the
credits for the autovector. Tempted to take a loan."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For some
reason."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's
like, super weird that they sell hotdogs now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You could always
mine again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You're allowed
two mining sites a day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Upgraded my scouts
battery. It lasts for a day and six hours now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Also got the navaid
and jet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We should go
artifacting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Lets do that Beacon,
Yeah? Dakhal's waiting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli, you don't
want a beacon, do you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The rub is that
none of the three of us can engineer on my clipper."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well I guess I
could, but my energy dumps are really weak."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Say are you
all beaconed out?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I'll
come, and I can bring an engineer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I found one,
just laying around in the spaceport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Some sort of
coat thief."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "If I had tried to
recharge my battery to full at the processor, Con, it would have taken three
hours with the upgrade."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, trickle
charging can be slow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But if you're
doing multi-day artifacting out at 777 or something, it's fine."

scooping."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We'll have to chat
about it some time. Heck, I'd be willing to explore to find new gas giants."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
#`uQVQofb;f]IR%3`f|QA0{TWGT*SqrOZ#23U5Hr
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds
unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits,
"Current riftflow conditions are 2189 light-minutes per second from Galactic
Westsouthwest and Slightly Down."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Critical Strike.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

[Starship "Courageous"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.
power
You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
launch
You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalliste, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.

Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a
settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of
beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates
a solar system may also be in this cluster.
A beacon has been placed trailing the orbit of Candelaria, a waypoint on the way
to and from deeper space.
This beacon lies along the path of the local solar system's galactic orbit. Dust
and debris has been pulled in its wake, leaving a funnel-shaped void.
