-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:11 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

03:13 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:15 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:15 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:15 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:16 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,000,000.00 credits from a xenology submission.

03:18 Mischief the large black felo jumps down from Lily Kaise's lap.

03:18 Mischief the large black felo seems to be hungry.
Mischief the large black felo approaches a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

03:22 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

03:30 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:30 I don't understand that.

03:30 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:30 [General Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "Things get sorted?"

03:54 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Kelp Escape or something? That's her's."

03:54 You peer out...

03:54 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove" and the four-person mule "Lion's Den" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

03:54 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yes, that's the one."

03:54 [Tactical Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "I am having problems."

03:54 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm going then, to see if I can run them off. There arn't many."

03:54 You say, "No, it's not."

03:54 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Just go if someone doesn't get there fast."

03:55 [Tactical Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "Long range laser ate the FTL drive..."

03:55 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Nothing bigger than an Ares that I saw, it'll most likely be fine."

03:55 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Do you have a temp drive?"

03:55 Lily Kaise says, "Wish they would tell her she can just jump."

03:55 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Have a temp drive? Always have a temp drive."

03:55 Lily Kaise says, "They don't interdict."

03:55 [Tactical Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "It is a little late for that now."

03:55 Lily Kaise sighs.

03:55 You say, "Oh hell."

03:55 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well, they ran away from me."

03:55 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Kani, move to the edge of the sector and go out till he clears it. He can bring you a drive."

03:56 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I hope you didn't explode?"

03:56 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Okay never mind then."

03:56 Lily Kaise says, "Heh I htink she did because she didn't have sense enough to move out of the sector. Oh well."

03:56 You nod. "Yeah."

03:56 You ask, "Let's go back to the torus?"

03:57 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Kani?"

03:57 Lily Kaise says, "Sure."

03:57 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

03:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

03:57 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

03:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

03:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:57 Lily Kaise says, "I think ERik ran them off though."

03:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:58 You say, "Yeah, I think so too."

03:58 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

03:58 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:58 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

03:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:58 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:58 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

03:58 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Kani, are you all right?"

03:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:58 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:58 Lily Kaise says, "You could have just gone it would have been ok."

03:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:58 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:58 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:58 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

03:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

03:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:58 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:58 Lily Kaise joins your group.

03:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:58 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

03:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:58 [General Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "I'm fine. A little grumpy. But fine."

03:59 You say, "I just want to be here in case we're needed later."

03:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

03:59 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Did you explode?"

03:59 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

03:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

03:59 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:59 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "No broken bones, I hope."

03:59 [General Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "All my parts are where they are supposed to be."

03:59 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok'should we go to the flare?"

03:59 Lily Kaise says, "Will look for the lizie though."

03:59 Lily Kaise glides south.

03:59 You say, "Nah, Erik ran them off, but we're closer to it if something happens."

03:59 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "At first I thought that was your fighter so I figured you were in there engaging."

04:00 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

04:00 Lily Kaise joins your group.

04:00 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

04:00 You say, "Sure, we can go to theFlare, but Erik ran them off. We'll be ready if we're needed later though."

04:00 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:00 Lily Kaise nods.

04:00 [General Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "I would not take an unupgraded fighter to engage things with long range lasers."

04:00 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

04:00 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and a small mystic purple bioplastic crate here.

04:01 [General Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "I'm fine, it was insured, nothing is injured but my pride."

04:01 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Insurance is good. We Fringe are insurance pros."

04:02 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Shh, it's too late anyways."

04:02 You say, "I don't have insurance on any of my ships."

04:03 Lily Kaise says, "So that is why I say just use the org ships for combat."

04:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Speaking of getting things blown up in fighters though, anyone feel like messing around in the sims for a while?"

04:04 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Just because."

04:04 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I would but am sort of busy watching this Fringer walk in and out of my ship repeatedly."

04:05 Lily Kaise says, "Weird."
