Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, a robotic chef named Nellie, a small hot beverage dispenser,
and a small hot coffee dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Heya there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heya."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Everyone quiet!"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "No, you talked. Therefore
untrue statement."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "One of them days. Now don't
wake my felo. Hadesa's takin good advantage of the quiet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Remind me not to try
to do a solo ground combat mission unless I feel really comfortable with things.
I already almost blew up twice today. Once when I was going through the outsider
mission on new earth and once when trying to get through destroying a rats pod.
Ouch. I had to launch out of both of them and get repairs for my battlesuit."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Ok, everyone, besides
myself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll have to
complete that rats mission some time today though. Gotta."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh whoa... there's
other people in the galaxy?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What
suit are you in?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What's up other
people!"
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I'd like to hope so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Gotta say it I'm a
little nervous."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Not much."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Bored out of my mind, so
just doing a few tesla."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have one of the

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "The rentals I mean.
Stupid comm."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's what bores me outta my
mind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And do
you have a minidrones module on it?"
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Salvaging does for me."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "There are no people till
coffee is consumed. Therefore I shall now be quiet again and consume it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yep. My downfall was
that I used all the drones too quickly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's no
shame in having to launch like that. It'll get easier once you start getting
more upgrades."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "You heard it from her, a cup
of coffee is more important than we are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
launching is way better than letting a giant space robot break both your legs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which
I've done more than once."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I have to think when I
salvage. Tesla is better with enemies, but...before I got enemies, it was like
washin my hair. Rinse, lather, repeat. Scan, extract repeat."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I"m generally looking for big
stones, hauling them up til they scream, then dropping them."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh wait. Lather, rinse,
repeat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know. I'd just
like to be able to complete it in one go though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I'm
not talking about one-use repair drones, I'm talking about the minidrones module
that lets you use the repair ability."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they're
two different things."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Yeah, it's a bit dull
without enemies, but what can one do!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or
whatever it's called in that suit, maybe minor restoration?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eve, lemme know when you've
had your coffee and you can think straight please."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "The microdrones?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Also, you can repair your suit if you have the Minidrones Module. Be certin to
use the Abilities you have as there is at least a Minor type of Repair Ability
even at this level."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Salvage, Michael. Roid haul,
lots of other things. But...some folks are fine with it...I just can't do it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The
minidrones won't run out, they just use energy, which will replenish with a
little time."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You
don't need to rely just upon Repair Drones."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Even the
basic repair ability should make those missions a snap in the rental."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can do that, Morris."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Yeah, I can't wait to get
enemies to deal with with tesla but I don't mind repetition if I have a good
book or something on holo or someone to talk to."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You can
see what you have equipped at the battlesuit outfitter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I don't think I have
the mini drones module. Just the micro drones. And you only get 5 of those."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kinda hard to read a book or
watch the holovid while doin solo Tesla."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
when you get a chance, head over to the battlesuit outfitter and put a
minidrones module on."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "To a point yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Then buy
the minor restoration ability."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll
be wrecking enforcer drones in no time."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "That's where the someone fun
to talk to comes in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have the
restoration already. But I can only have two modules on the rental."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You want
guns and minidrones."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You
are confusing Repair Drones with Minidrones but yes you should go to the
Battlesuit Outfitter and check the terminal for what you can equip your suit
with and you should obtain the Minidrones and ok you should have Minidrones and
a lasers more than likely or some other gun but you'd need ammunition which you
will need to purchase."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, it's a bit more
tolerable with enemies. But before 'em..."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I just did my best to speed
run them, just to see how fast Ic ould get it done."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Don't know that i'd try it
with drones, but I would take a holo and listen to it without. I might do that
again."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How do ya operate your suit
while holdin the holovid?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's
shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its
surroundings.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm gonna check to
see what my suit has right now. I ended up transferring it to vermin."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Speed runs were fun. Just
take a time meter, hell I'd do it even with drones."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well might be harder for you
to do it MOrris, I wedged it between protuberant anatomy and kept my hands free.
It's tight in my suit, so that works."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Erm."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "So creative."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Carefully prop it inside
with you, I just really need to keep it where Ican hear it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey coughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I...never mind."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits an irritating burst of static.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oops."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I just tend to prop it up
on my shoulder."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I didn't say it was
comfortable. That's why I only did it the one time."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Serious question though,
when do you exactly get enemies?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And it sits there? Lightning'd
make me jump once and it'd be down buried somewhere."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I dunn."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Those corners are pokey."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not sure Michael. Tier 2 suit
maybe?"
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Ah, ok thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And I have the
chaingun and microdrone modules installed. Those are the only two I can have
though. Or really any two modules."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I've been wondering that too."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I have a 1.5 and I have
them. Can't tell yo uwhen they showed up."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "If I find out before you
michael I'll let you know, and vice versa."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Look
under abilities and be certain you purchase all that are available."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I figure they just show up
whenever your sites look tempting."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I do solo Tesla so rarely.
Somebody mentioned tier 2 once. Somebody else said they check your industry
points fore they send ya someplace with drones. So I really don't know."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Well, will find out soon
enough."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Just keep doing Tesla and
it'll happen eventually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yep, sure did. Micro
restoration."
[General Communication] "Y'all can't see me shudder." Morris Corlew chuckles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok
then when you are in your battlesuit, be certain to press the COMMANDS button
and set up those buttons so tht you can use micro Restoration."
[General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "It isn't that bad, this like
my 18th for the day."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Holy..."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "In any case. Whether or not
you wedge it, balance, or whatever, I agree with you MOrris that it's a
distraction."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think I'd be dead at 4."

is a separate ability from using Repair drones. Repair Drones are supplemental
to using an ability."

"So, if it spins slower, you're going the right direction."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Make sure the
grapple is good enough for the grade. I usually start at one end then move back
and forth as needed, reducing my angle changes until you hit it. Pay attention
to how the chunk moves when you grapple it, for clues on how close you are
getting. The slower it moves, the closer you are."

of us remember every move we make at every single moment. but I damn sure didn't
take any for myself."

felo, especially if you're tryin to keep a line of felo Evenia might want, ya
might wanna revoke her keys if she has 'em or not give her any."

A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well I know this. Which was
exactly why I poked my nose in when you were away, to make sure there weren't
any maned on there. I don't need or want your felo. If I wanted one, I'd simply
ask. You already knew of my interest anyway, since you mentioned you might be
getting rid of those ships of felo. Or not getting rid, but you said the ships
you have are far too many. So if my kindness in checking on animals means
somehow I've done something wrong, I'll apologize. Good luck with your felo in
the future."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Considerin you were seen movin
felo from the ships, and onto 'em...and not just the tug...that kinda don't hold
water."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can say whatcha want. But
I know what I saw on them videos. I trusted ya...gave ya a chance. I shoulda
known better. Burn me once shame on you, burn me twice, shame on me."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The four-person mule "Lion's Den", the two-person flare "Deadly Strike", and the
two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 003" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully

one around even when I get better suits, just in case."

sure."
[General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I like how versatile they
are. It's why I had one, they were good for RATS pods and the low deps."

free-for-all kinda thing."

Ather'd done his free-for-all this year. Maybe next year."

downside."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's a starship combat thing.
He was considerin makin it more tournament style last I heard but then it never
happened."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah damn. See I can gun and
engineer okay, but flying is not my forte. I may have gotten all my hours, but
the actual flying in my test when it came down to combat was hell."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You'll get there."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"And I can help you with flying."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd like to get there a little
faster, personally."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just don't let nobody have ya
fly a high cruiser beacon as your very first intro to combat flyin. And if
somebody tries it...lemme know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I know a couple
basic patterns (east/west, north/south) that kinda thing, but anything more
complex makes my brain go mushy."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Morris will write them a
flaming letter."

"It's not best to fly set patterns."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah. Too
predictable?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Heh I did that flying my first
combat ship on a low. I did better with someone else's the first three times.
Got cocky I suppose. Or just sucked. Which is also possible."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, let's just say there's
pilots that'll do that to folks. And it's scared more than one pilot offa flyin
combat."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Exactly. Seriously thouggh, I'd be happy to help you out."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ouch. Yeah I really hope it
doesn't happen to me."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "It all depends on the person. I
am a risk taker so that wouldn't have been so bad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Once I get a little
more experience I'll see what we can do."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Best I can tell ya is don't be
afraid to say no. If ya ain't ready, ya ain't ready."
[General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits an irritating burst of static.
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "See, I'm not the kind of
person who likes to take risks, especially nt with other peoples' ships."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Oh the reason why I tried
flying my own ship was so if I blew up it was my own ship and not someone
else's. I didn't care so much about the ship, but I did get annoyed that I
sucked as badly as I did."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I doubt someone is really going
to let you just go and blow up their billion credit ship."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, if ya wanna work on it,
lemme know. I can take ya out in a corvette or somethin, letcha fly a low and
get used to it."
ftra 1 No problem. We can pracctice in simulators so you don't risk anyone's
ship.
I don't understand that.

it."
[General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm definitely willing to
learn, so there's that. I tend to do better in controlled areas."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Good deal. I might take you up
on that at somep oint."

I think."

Corlew, we will teach you the ways of the exploding on overdriven beacons."

A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chirps quietly as it receives a
new notice.
Jacob,
I didn't want to say this over comms, but I highly discourage learning space
combat from Morris. For one, he tends to get hit a lot and doesn't really care.
This is not good as our ships cannot take as much damage as their ships can.
Therefore, our flying strategy tends to be somewhat different than League
pilots. I personally believe that people should learn space combat from their
own alliance. That way, people have the opportunity to learn how to best use
their own alliance's combat ships.
Best Regards,

Dear Shule,
I know, and I thank you for it, and I'd like to try it again.  I"m going to
practice some with the simulators first.  That helped with my gunning, and i"m
sure it'll help with the piloting.  When I get to that point, i'll call you
first.  I'm not wild about Morris, but I'm also trying to maintain bridges there
which is what led to the question.  You never know when you need someone's help
and the only person you can call on is someone you don't like much.  Better to
be civil and practice diplomacy than to be left hanging cause you've cut all
lines of communication.  Take care,
Lexie

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

four and a half hours to 287."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't
think I've ever seen rift conditions this bad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would
turn around but I have to move my ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. you
sure you left from the right spot? That sounds like there's no aceleration."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I
paid the toll and everything."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "12 rats in orion, just so
people are aware."

is exactly in the direction I'm going and at 9721 l-m/s though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is
pretty fast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So
that's probably why."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Weird, I
wonder if they forgot to put the accelerator on or something. You might have
just paid the toll for the inserter alone."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person medium transport "Star Of Gutenberg". The organization has earned
1,668,293.86 credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, but
even with that, if you were accelerated it shouldn't take that long. 285 is not
really all that far if I remember right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I
guess that's possible. The toll said it was for an accelerator."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If that
matters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh it did?
Hmm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
they did mess it up. I've noticed using the inserter from the other side doesn't
get me back to 286."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It puts
me in random sectors."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I came
out in Olivia's Pearl yesterday."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits,
"That sounds disconcerting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, that's
just because of how close all the beacons are together."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That happens
with rift travel sometimes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So you
get blown off course."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Even
when using an inserter?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not really
that, it's just the way it pulls you out. Sometimes a different beacon than the
one you are aiming for is the one that pulls you out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Wow, 5
hours now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm
moving at a paltry 544 l-min/s."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But I'm
wondering, if someone didn't set the heading for the accelerator, if it would
still charge you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
guess that's possible."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
couldn't take it. I'll just try in a few hours."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there
a map?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Like of
space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was
thinking I don't know where any of our planets are in relation to one another."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I
thougth I might start mapping it myself using the providence ndb locator."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, not
really. You can use starcharts, but it takes some training to read them
properly. Space is always changing and shifting so it's hard to always have a
accurate map."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh I see what
you mean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
guess it makes sense that the relative positions of the planets would change."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "On long
timescales, though, I would think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah it's on
long time scales. It's doable to figure out where they are in relation to each
other. The easiest way is probably with a friend and a long-ranged scanner but
that's kind of not much of an option at the moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
the accelerators are lined up, it was just bad weather."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's
crazy."
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives
a new notice.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cackles!
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That is sad.
Beautiful, but sad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well at
least we're succeeding at what we set out to do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,
absolutely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It just
happens to be very little."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It just feels
wrong though. To be pleased to see results like that. Normally that would make
me jump up and work my butt off."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Who
knows, maybe in three, four months."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We'll be
back to work!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli chokes as he transmits, "Three or four?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Stars, I hope
it doesn't take that long."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You're
right. It's gotta be at least eight."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well
with the negotiations on hold..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I still can't
believe they only put them on hold. Anything that Danikin set up should be
purged. If they are goign to continue to insist on outccord,  the least they can
do is not use some shady escapist's deal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder
what they're even negotiating about."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It seems as
though they still want access to the facilities and things like that, without
contributing and without having to abide by restrictions. Though I'm not privvy
on the specifics."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, so
they say. I can't imagine what reason the Accord would have to allow access to
anything if we left."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was pretty
surprised that the Union basically insisted on not having access to Geminis,
it's very odd."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
Union insisted?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, that's
not exactly what the headline said, no. It said that we may lose access to the
Gemini due to Union insistance on limiting interaction."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I
see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So I guess,
in a way, they did insist on it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, in
a sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, we
can't fly geminis to GMG anymore, anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But I
guess we might get attacked by turtle thralls at any time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So
they're still good to have."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Does
rifting consume power the way jumping does?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It
doesn't seem to."
