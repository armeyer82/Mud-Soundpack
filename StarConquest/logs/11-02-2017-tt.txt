Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top here.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Space Defense Captain]
This office is small but elegant, the recessed lighting shining softly over pale
green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with
an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of
the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners
of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The
door is closed.
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet
here.
You can go east.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

"Kim, let me know when you're ready to do beacons."
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station in thirty seconds unless

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase
"Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space

The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

it last night, I don't think I can at this exact moment."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder what I
get after the medium transport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "From unreality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heavy transport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder how
many priority runs I need for that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've done over
1000."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think it's um.. 90k
storage?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't know, I just got
my second non-promotion the other day. They were very nice abou ttelling me that
I did not get promoted again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I've had
one non-promotion towards it so far."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Once I get that one, I'm
probably going to stop doing as many priorty deliveries and just focus on
freight. You can already make a fair amount from shipping freight with the
medium."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's
what I'm thinking I'll do too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably even get like a
robot and a plant to make it bigger heh, since we'll probably be stuck with it
for a long time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might try a
couple different plants."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And see whether
speed or size is better."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It will be like
an experiment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I tried doing
passenger runs for a while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems
strictly worse than courier runs to me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe I'm
missing something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you know if
there's been any movement on the skim issue?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Has Ather been
working on that behind the scenes?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmmm?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think he said he wants
it to be you and I, contantine, when he goes. But I honestly thought it would
have happened by now. That's one reason I didn't go with Katina and the others."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws grips a
plastic wrecked EAOS Defender firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't
break the toy.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Since he's going on the
artifacting trip though, I can only assume we've got a while still."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm very tempted to try
and switch to a runabout for the trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What are those
all about? Are they faster than sightseers?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, with no boosts or
anything, mine has a max speed of 28k. Which is faster than my sightseer which
has a double speed plant."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if I
can get one put together in time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't have a
ticket, though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Eve usually keeps spares
in case anyoen wants one, she might have one she'll sell you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eh, I would feel
like a chump asking her, since she just sold me the detector for the sightseer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I read in this
book of upgrades about being able to get certain ones at dry docks. Could either
of you give me directions to these... dry docks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll just do
this one in the sightseer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Just jump to Drydock.
It's got it's own sector."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can just
autotravel there."

place?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Bring a spacesuit, and
think twice before jumping out of strange holes."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Before you go increasing the size of your starship for the Artifacting trip,
you probably need to contact Johann as the available Docking Bay space was
already nearly maxed out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's
also true, Lily."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's a large
station in league space. Kinda rundown but still very functional."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And where
might I buy closets, or a wardrobe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, definitely want to
talk to Johann first. Though we've had two people drop out so I'm betting it's
fine."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
thought of it but I don't need any storage space anyways and I like having an
onboard shower and living quarters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ardsley has a
furniture shop, Landfall might have that in its furniture shop."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The station in
the Calm sells cheaper build it yourself type options."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's one of the
debates i'm having with myself Lily. Do I want to sacrifice my living quarters
and shower for that extra bit of speed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Actually...
yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Plus, the work I'd have
to do to get it ready to go in time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Living quarters
would be nice. I've done up my sightseer storage room as best I can, but it's
still cold and gray."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I also like the
sightseer battery."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Probably going to try to
make a quick trip to Feng Wo while we're there. Just to get a look at the place
and meet some of hte folks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've discovered
that I'm definitely a 24+ hour at a time kind of artifacter."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I've
slept in many a storage room."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hell yeah Constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's how we used to
have to do it back in the day anyways, to make it worthwhile. No such thing as
quick trip tot he bubble like there is today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I still feel weird when I
hear people just randomly decided to go to GMG on a whim. I remember having to
plan that shit out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, are the rest
stations relatively new?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah
well if we had 4 of us in my little Sightseer which was the original plan, an
extra room would have been welcomed and uh huh the shower!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Still you can put a portable shower in the head which is what I always did
before."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah that's what
I did in mine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I guess you could say
they're relatively new."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't imagine
doing what I did at the bubble without the station out there."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix
Dissident's neck.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess it
probably would have taken me months."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "As it is I'm
almost capped on exploration."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Used to it was like this,
 "Hey, you want to go to GMG? Oh, you do? Ok Let's meet up on Wednesday and head
out so we can get started on thursday morning""
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Haha
surprised you're not already but you sure will be when we get back!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've never
actually hit a cap on anything, but yeah, I think the artifacts from the trip
are sure to get me there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When I was a
cadet I used to get close on space combat all the time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh for the bubble I just
used to artifact as much as I could, then cut power to certain systems and just
sleep in my ship floating in space. The stations are certainly much safer."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
used to cap all the time but I am probably pretty far below capping anything now
and thankfully as I had exploration caps for months!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Land."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Eli
when Shule and were able to go to gMG, we used ot put a decent recharging
station out there and we would regularly spend the weekend out there or a couple
of days at a time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I keep
thinking."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One more haul,
and Unreality is sure to recognize my loyalty."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And devotion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But no."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If
we could get someone to cooperate with us, we could take a carrier over the skim
via the Rift and make a little excursion out of it sometime."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think shooting down
other couriers gets you the most towards that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Wait, what?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unreality wants
me wrecking other courier ships?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Of
course!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But
not from the same company."

perfectly."

cutthroat galaxy."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You
won't be in other's good graces as it will royallypiss them off which is why
it's not done regularly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Is there a
furniture store on new phoenix?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah,  it irks people,
but it's lega for sure. The navy won't even respond."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's
Rattania."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If I
was the aggressive type."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forget which
street its on, but it's at the north end of the the city."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thre
certainly are a few names... who I'd love wo wreck!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Thanks
constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You don't even have to
use a courier ship to do it. You can just fly around in a fighter or something
and do it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see very few
other couriers in general."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have seen a
Scientia courier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are those flown
by civilian pilots?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, that's probably me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I could have
worked for any courier company, not just Unreality?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep."

questioning my decision."
A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. At least the
Scientia one isn't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can always quit, but
if you've got a medium already you'll be losing a lot of progress."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I can't do
that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm a company
man now."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I had only had one

might not have done it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm hoping that
some day."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Found it.
Unfortunately, I found a jewlery shop first. Picked myself up a new necklace and

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing red and yellow aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a small white trash bin, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.

Subject: Death and Avarice final post
Author: Johann Schraft
Posted: 21:58  2 November 2317 GST

So, we are almost set! This is my first final checklist which will probably be
updated as something vital I forgot gets brought to my attention.
First, be sure several of your friends, or in Ather's case, people who you can
barely tolerate today will do fine, have keys to your artifacting ship. Also, as
the owner of the carrier, Nissi should probably have access to everyone's
artifacting ship keys just in case.
Second, Melinda offered, and I don't see why not, that if up to five people want
to come home after a few days, she will take them home in the transport.
Third, for the trip down, the transport crew will be:
Johann, Melinda, Damien, Lily, shule, Ted, and Aisling.
Finally, if we leave, and you're not aboard, I don't plan on turning around, so
make yourself accessible, or be left behind.
The final crew list is as follows:
Aisling The Fox: 6.5
Ather Jamoa: 6.5
sean Sloan: 6.5
Ali Kandan: 6.5
Tobias and Sarah: 6.5
Nicolette Lawrence: 6.5
Damien Alexander: 6.5
Ted Warburton: 6.5
Alko Delovega: 6.5
Bryan Stout: 6.5
Melinda Michaels: 5
Nissi Valdaire: 5
Johann Schraft: 5
Evenia Kallseah: 5
Eli Grey: 5
Lily, Shule,: 5
Constantine Stone: 5
Damien Goss: 5
Chase Marshal: NA
total so far: 105/117
Thanks,
Johann Schraft

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, Purr the humanoid
service robot, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.
The current civilian term started on  2 October 2317 GST. Time remaining: 9

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
-06n|G$w@2wY(toC:0lkc76|kE'wk&zMw_%x!Q&G
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
