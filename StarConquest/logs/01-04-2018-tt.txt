Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black
plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go out.

New Major Changes:
-----
Two new advanced battlesuit classes are now available.
One is available through a mission that has to do with a certain mythical bird
of unlikely composition, because the AEU needs a battlesuit to fill its role
rather urgently. Though the mission and the battlesuit are available only to AEU
players at present, players of other alliances are mechanically able to assist
with the mission if they so choose. An equivalent Accord mission will come
relatively soon.
The second new battlesuit is available through the Megapod raids and also fills
a role that certain ground combatants may be missing, though its need is not as
urgent. It's available among the possible loot of the newest raid type. Please
look forward to arguing over who gets it first!

New Minor Changes:
-----
Ships with base block attachments must now detach them before landing.
   Posted 9 hours, 15 minutes, and 42 seconds ago
-----
RATS nests will now be found amongst debris fields only. The previous generation
pattern was something of a holdover from the older sector system, and we feel
this change will make more sense thematically.
