02:06:21 [MTTS] lunarfang: Someone correct me if I'm wrong.

02:06:38 [MTTS] usfolks: It's something like that. It's the Bears Bears thing. But as far as I know it's not connected to the claw thing.

02:06:43 [MTTS] atherj: I don't think they're actually anything, really. Just a random spontaneous host thing.

02:06:53 [MTTS] kaite: I have never gotten bears in an activity whereby points were earned.

02:07:38 [MTTS] Ulias: I've never been a part of a bears bears bears thing. I don't even know what that is.

02:09:19 [MTTS] Ulias: They're part of the IC points part <shrug>.

02:09:48 [MTTS] Ulias: Not saying you guys aren't right, I just have no idea what bears bears bears is and I got my bears points years ago.

02:10:00 [MTTS] usfolks: I know. But they were literally right after hosts posting a bears bears thing to the gamewide output.

02:10:24 [MTTS] kaite: One time I got 2 while docking sightseers to a platform and was doing a bit of spacewalking.

02:10:30 [MTTS] atherj: You probably were a part of it when youw ere logged in and inactive or something.

02:11:07 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

02:11:52 [MTTS] atherj: They really are random far as I've seen, trust me, gang. I've never seen anything except randomness when it comes to the "bears bears!" thing.

02:12:37 [MTTS] usfolks: It's host initiated. I can tell you that much.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

07:59:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not a big deal really. Points and starship rights are hardly what is important at the moment."

08:05:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Having a theory wasn't the problem Vernos, it's what you decided to do with it. Gottta let other alliances handle their own business."

11:40:13 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

11:40:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

11:40:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

11:40:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:40:28 The ship is already moving.

11:40:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:40:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:40:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:40:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

11:40:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:40:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:40:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:40:39 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.

11:40:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Endymion.

11:41:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:41:32 The ship's current engine speed is 6000 km/s.

11:41:32 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 8.0 seconds.
The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

11:41:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

11:41:38 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:41:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:41:49 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:41:50 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:42:02  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

11:42:02 You are carrying nothing.

11:48:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

11:48:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

11:48:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

11:59:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

11:59:10 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

11:59:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

11:59:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

11:59:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

11:59:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

11:59:41 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

11:59:51 You scramble to your feet.

12:00:01 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

12:01:01 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

12:01:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:01:33 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

12:01:35 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

12:01:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"

12:09:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Love where dit you go?"

12:10:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Good morning. Just running some errands."

12:10:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

12:10:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Endymion Spaceport; Landing Pad.

12:10:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:10:51 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:10:52 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:10:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:10:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:11:05 The ship is already moving.

12:11:06 The ship is already moving.

12:11:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:54:28 Tamra Swenson asks, "Totally?"

19:54:29 You say, "Yeah."

19:54:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So by suggesting that she helped pirates steal something you may have done so."

20:12:59 [Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]

20:12:59 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

20:13:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Our old cruisers were still using the designs from the war. When we were throwing together warships with whatever we could."

20:13:50 Tamra Swenson says, "I like the name hope good optimistic name."

20:13:58 Tamra Swenson grins.

20:14:00 You say, "It's a tactical platform. Do you want to put that felo in your ship? I like it too."

20:15:07 Tamra Swenson says, "I did."

20:15:20 Tamra Swenson says, "I brought my ship effervescent zephre."

20:15:24 Tamra Swenson laughs.

20:15:30 Tamra Swenson says, "It's a mouthful but a good ship."

20:16:07 You grin.

20:16:10 You say, "Oh."

20:16:13 Tamra Swenson
She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and has freckled skin. Her body is a bit thinner than average with attractively curved hips and pleasantly curved calves. She has angular shoulders and slightly smaller than average breasts. Her abdomen is firm and punctuated by a small navel. Her face is heart-shaped, lightly-freckled, and subtly asymmetrical, with a delicate nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rosy and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Subtle plum blush is applied to her cheeks. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-grey and narrow, and enhanced with thick black eyeliner. Her shoulder-length, wavy hair is coppery red and swept back from her face into a mass of tousled curls. She has long painted opalescent purple fingernails.
 She is wearing a wide-brimmed purple hat decorated with a plume of silver feathers, a short-sleeved purple cropped top encrusted with sparkling amethyst and ivory jeweled tulips across the front, a tasteful silver watch with diamond accents, a pair of skinny purple jeans with amethyst and ivory jeweled tulips on the front and back pockets, and a pair of purple silk stilettos illustrated with impressionistic sketches of silver bamboo leaves. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a light metallic gray flightbag with a multicolored spiral galaxy on the side, a tyrian purple swivel einrophone in
20:16:13  a golden brown reinforced plastic phone holster, a compact metallic royal purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a glittery royal purple camera strap, a metachannel FTL communicator, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a silver ring set with a polished opalescent moonstone, a glittering purple evening bag, a silver necklace with a clear quartz flower pendant, and a delicate silver necklace with an opalescent moonstone pendant. Her face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

20:16:24 Tamra Swenson asks, "What does a tactical pratform do?"

20:16:24 You say, "I didn't see that you didn't have it anymore."

20:16:27 Tamra Swenson asks, "Platform?"

20:16:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will not ever know the difference with all the hate going around. I wanted to see the changes in the two inside and out."

20:16:37 Tamra Swenson says, "Oh well, I am quick."

20:16:43 Tamra Swenson grins.

20:16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm in the 2314 broadcasts."

20:16:49 You say, "You can customize it to what you want depending on what ships you attach to it."

20:17:06 Tamra Swenson asks, "Ah amazing, so it's a way of making ships into different ships?"

20:17:12 Tamra Swenson asks, "Or some such?"

20:17:12 You say, "Kind of."

20:17:18 Tamra Swenson asks, "Can you tell me an example?"

20:17:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It was mostly just weapons redistrubtion. There's not a whole lot to see the difference in."

20:17:19 You nod.

20:17:23 Tamra Swenson smiles.

20:17:45 You say, "Like I attached three shuttles to this ship and made it into one that has a lot of storage."

20:17:53 You say, "Interplanetary shuttles."

20:18:06 Tamra leans against him resting her head on his chest.

20:18:44 Tamra Swenson says, "Oh wow!!!! so it's a way of uniteing more than one ship and making it even more powerful."

20:18:50 Tamra Swenson says, "Or spacious etc."

20:18:52 You nod.

20:18:54 You grin.

20:18:58 You wrap your arms around Tamra Swenson, pulling her close.

20:19:02 You sit down on a large leather couch.

20:19:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Time to race rats for an artifsact."

20:19:08 Tamra Swenson says, "Mmm sounds like some ingenious work."

20:19:11 Tamra Swenson sits down on a large leather couch.

20:19:16 You smile.

20:19:24 Tamra Swenson cheers.

20:19:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Artifact I mean."

20:19:32 You say, "I have another one that I attached three hyperian fighters too."

20:19:36 You say, "To."

20:19:44 Tamra Swenson says, "So those have more firepower."

20:19:47 Tamra Swenson asks, "Right?"

20:20:04 Tamra Swenson says, "Sounds kinda cumbersome to fly though."

20:20:22 Tamra Swenson opens a glittering purple evening bag.

20:20:24 You nod.

20:20:32 You say, "Nah, it just turns it into a gunship."

20:20:43 You cuddle up to Tamra Swenson.

20:21:22 Tamra Swenson says, "So you can make your own gunship then using this, great design."

20:21:25 You nod.

20:21:26 Tamra Swenson grins.

20:21:42 You say, "And the gunship can either be a fighting ship, a crago ship, or an exploration ship."

20:21:49 You say, "Cargo."

20:21:53 Tamra Swenson snuggles up to your shoulder.

20:22:28 You wrap your arms around Tamra Swenson, pulling her close.

20:22:41 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

20:22:49 You glance at your communicator's screen.

20:22:50 Notice from the Space Defense Captain: As of this writing, all AEU sectors are clear of threats. The Old Frontier Processor will likely be unsafe in a few hours, so be aware of that. We had some good fighter beacon activity yesterday -- currently, Eli leads with 6 ships and Evangeline is close behind with 5. There are still a few hours left in the contest, so fire up those launchers and win some stuff! [17:18 24 July 2317 GST]

20:22:50 Tamra traces his jawline with her fingertip.

20:22:56 Tamra Swenson blushes.

20:23:32 Shule caresses your back, getting lower and lower.

20:24:00 You ask, "What?"

20:24:03 You say, "Sorry."

20:25:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Try span."

20:25:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Vernos won't even try for the contest as he thinks we don't have enough pilots."

20:25:36 Tamra Swenson says, "It feels great, shule, but I will lose track of time, and then the felo will starve and it'll be my falt."

20:25:40 Tamra Swenson laughs.

20:25:46 You say, "Awww."

20:25:57 You say, "We can get it food and a bowl really quick."

20:26:02 You grin.

20:26:06 You remove a glossy white ceramic felo chow bowl from a leather briefcase.

20:26:12 Tamra Swenson says, "I really enjoy this though, I want you to know this. As soon as I have relieved myself of that responsability I shall feel a lot better."

20:26:16 You give a glossy white ceramic felo chow bowl to Tamra Swenson.

20:26:21 You say, "There's a bowl."

20:26:24 You remove a family size bag labeled "Low-Grade Dry Felo Chow" from a leather briefcase.

20:28:27 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's on a different channel, I thought?"

20:28:28 You ask, "Ok?"

20:28:30 Tamra Swenson nods.

20:28:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It is. I'm tryin to find it."

20:28:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "At least there was that one about the Resistance Anniversary party, and that one about the unidentified warships that seem to be some sort of new allies, though I've never heard about it until now."

20:28:39 Tamra Swenson says, "Let's go aboard your vessel."

20:28:44 Tamra Swenson gives you a very large and extraordinarily soft gray and brown shamak fur.

20:29:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I swear I saw it on Span."

20:29:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well that makes sense Emily, but I asked several folks before this and was told repeatedly that it was on ISn. Was even told I'd have to sit through Ather's long interview if I wanted to see it."

20:29:12 Tamra Swenson says, "I thought that'd be a good decor emphasizer."

20:29:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

20:29:17 Tamra Swenson exclaims, "Or something!"

20:30:01 Tamra puts her right arm around him drawing him close.

20:30:08 You say, "Come sit."

20:30:09 [Starship "Israel Hope"; Control Room]

20:30:09 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, a polished rosewood bar, and a very large and extraordinarily soft gray and brown shamak fur here.

20:33:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's definitely on SPN2 if you're lookin for the slaver trial Eli."

20:33:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And I certainly would like to know more about th ese warships. I'm guessing there simply has not been anymore developments. We'd have likely heard by now if there were."

20:33:30 Shule brushes your cheek with his lips.

20:33:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. I happened to miss that. Was probably just workin on flight school at the time."

20:33:56 Tamra Swenson asks, "Are you a type of pilot who has lots of peoples or just one?"

20:34:49 Tamra Swenson says, "That is a beautiful thing."

20:34:55 You smile.

20:34:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A news piece about unidentified warships that assisted in repelling an attack on Ars Magna, emily. They transmitted an indecipherable signal."

20:35:11 You kiss Tamra Swenson softly on the neck.

You can go south, up, and out.

21:42:36 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:42:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:43:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:43:18 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:43:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:43:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:43:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:43:39 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:43:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

21:44:15 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey."

21:44:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Would you like to help deploy the scooping station?"

21:44:41 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:44:41 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:44:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure."

21:44:46 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

21:45:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:45:47 You peer out...

[Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four]
This is a fully modern docking bay, made of the same sleek, slightly darkened metal that the exterior of the station is made from. Brightly painted yellow lines mark entry and exit paths for ships, and rows of dotted lines indicate where ships may touch down. A series of electromagnetic manipulators prevent atmosphere from escaping into space when the bay door is opened. One of the EMMs is emitting a steady hum, indicating that it should be replaced. A ramp leads up to the rest of the station.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

21:45:51 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:45:51 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay Four.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

21:48:10 Constantine Stone says, "I'll work on my mining site until then."

21:48:11 Constantine Stone stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

21:48:39 Constantine Stone asks, "What time do you think we will want to leave here?"

21:49:01 You say, "Ok."

21:49:06 You say, "Umm, not sure."

21:49:10 You say, "Less than an hour."

21:49:20 Constantine Stone says, "Okay, I'll come back here in about a half hour."

21:52:53 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station.

21:52:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:53:42 The ship's current engine speed is 6000 km/s.

21:53:42 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 16.0 seconds.

21:54:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:54:11 You begin the docking sequence.

21:54:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

21:54:26 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

21:54:26 You can go out and enter into the ship.
The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:54:27 You exit the ship.

21:54:27 [AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station; Docking Bay]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is parked here.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:54:44 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:54:45 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

21:54:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "43 minutes."

21:54:51 You begin the launch sequence.

21:54:56 A launch trajectory is located.

21:54:56 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:55:04 The ship is already moving.

21:55:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:55:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:55:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:55:10 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

21:55:13 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:55:15 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:55:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:55:16 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:55:17 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

21:55:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:55:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:55:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:55:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:55:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:55:27 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:55:27 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

21:55:28 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:55:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:55:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:55:32 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:55:35 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Firestorm. Welcome to Accord space."

21:56:23 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:56:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:56:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:56:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:56:38 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:57:10 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:57:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "It will take us some time to get out there too, though, right?"

21:57:42 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

21:58:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nah, not very long."

21:59:42 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a string of light purple plastic kelp.

22:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:01:42 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

22:03:52 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

22:21:12 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm waiting for EAOS's reaction."

22:21:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."

22:21:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How about they oust him?"

22:21:22 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

22:21:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I don't think any of us would miss him if somebody did do that."

22:22:11 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They very likely could pull another sheffield thing. It wouldn't surprise me."

22:22:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "What in the mother of all flying fucks is he on about?"

22:23:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'm sorry, but I don't have words. I got nothin'. He's cracked. Simple as that."

22:23:32 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You just said words."

22:23:42 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with short dangling tendrils and a chartreuse glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:23:53 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, this is in a sense worse than what Sheffield actually did in his presidency. Sheffield actually admitted that the Outsiders exist/they're going to kill us all, and was fatalistic ultimately. He might've been wrong, but at least he was trying to do what he did for the good of protecting his alliance. I'm not saying it was a good idea, I'm saying he believed it was a good idea. President Best though, is trying to simply pretend that the problem doesn't exist and wants to discredit anyone who says otherwise."

22:23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And what about the aparklehawks? Hmm? If Grenwold was never destroyed, then how did felo end up in the velourian forest and end the existiance of the sparklehawks and other speices?"

22:24:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Godamnit, I'm so mad I can't talk."

22:24:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think he's trying to say that it's always been chunks, Eli. That it wasn't a recent thing. I mean, he's not correct, but that's what he's saying."

22:25:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wonder if he's been drug tested recently."

22:25:19 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "He damn well should be."

22:25:33 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or had a mental health screaning."

22:25:43 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior pulsates gently.

22:26:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "He'd have the Ministry of facts change the result if he failed."

22:26:03 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "How about a full medical? All that shit included? Guy's cracked."

22:26:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs. "Indeed."

22:26:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 607,031.25 credits from a xenology submission.

22:26:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, remember what they put Rebane through? Wonder why they never did that with him? I mean he was showin signs back then."

22:27:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What happened to the sparklehawks Best? Hmm? Or did they never exist either? The velourian forest was never decalred a felo refuge? They didn't kill off multiple species?"

22:28:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Where did they come from, if Grenwold was always just asteroid."

22:28:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Straight up, Eli."

22:28:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If he were to walk around there, it'd be obvious what happened there. EAOS fabrication my socks."

22:29:00 [General Communication] Evenia laughs coldly. "Him? Walk around there?"

22:29:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh yes, his royal highness is above that."

22:31:43 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

22:32:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I know it, Eli. But he's obviously got nothing better to do than try to discredit you."

22:32:14 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm."

22:32:19 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "He could be genuinely unwell."

22:32:33 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You did the right thing speaking out, but he needs a target."

22:32:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, it was obvious how nuts he was during the election. He's just showin more and more signs. I hope the folks that voted for him are genuinely happy."

22:33:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's what bullies do, pick a target, I just don't think you're a very good person to pick."

22:33:23 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Like I say, if that's democracy, I'm glad we don't have it."

22:33:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If he is honestly unwell. He needs to be tested. And he needs to not be in that office."

22:34:53 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "We got faith in ya. Eli. He's trying to anger you. Discredit you. Anything he can do. But you did the right thing. Don't doubt that."

22:35:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Agreed."

22:35:55 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Wait, are we talking about Best or Vern?"

22:36:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You might want this."

22:36:06 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Bunk beds in quarantine."

22:36:24 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Best, Nissi."

22:37:24 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,041,378.80 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

22:38:37 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is shutting down.

22:38:37 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 48 megacredits from AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station.

22:42:27 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

22:42:50 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure the truth will be known for certain! It was witnessed by like several hundred people!"

22:43:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "What the fuck."

22:43:21 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
22:43:22 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

22:43:25 You scramble to your feet.

22:43:26 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:43:26 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

22:43:29 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

22:43:29 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:43:30 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:43:31 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

22:43:31 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:43:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:43:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

* Disagreement by Prominent Figures on Whether Grenwold Was Destroyed by Outsiders: The Truth Will Probably Never Be Known For Certain [24 July 2317] (NEN)

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

22:43:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

22:43:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:43:46 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

22:43:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:43:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:43:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:43:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

22:43:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:43:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:43:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:43:56 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:43:57 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

22:43:58 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:44:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:44:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:44:01 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:44:02 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

22:44:03 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:44:05 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:44:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:44:06 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:44:07 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

22:44:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:44:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:44:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:44:11 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:44:13 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

22:44:14 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Four).

22:44:14 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Firestorm. Welcome to Accord space."

22:44:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:44:48 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They did that weird thingy that they do when they power up their phased destabilizing beam, then they drew power from other ships too so that they could crack open the planet, and then bam! Literally."

22:44:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:44:49 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

22:44:54 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

22:44:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

22:45:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

22:45:04 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:45:05 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:45:06 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

22:45:06 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You exit the ship.

You can go northeast, southeast, and up.

22:45:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The truth will never be nown? Are they serious? Wasn't Masterson killed in the same attack mere minutes after this when the same ship destroyed Resistance headquarters?"

22:45:07 I don't understand that.

22:45:07 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Yup. I was there too!"

22:45:10 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Airlock]

22:45:10 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:45:11 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

22:45:12 You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Constantine Stone is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

22:45:18 You wave to Constantine Stone.

22:45:22 You ask, "Ready?"

22:45:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I suppose his brave sacrifice never happened, either.. what in the hell is going on?"

22:45:37 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah. They basically used the debris from grenwold's destruction to find the station."

22:45:57 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:45:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:46:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "These are historical facts that are really, really not up for debate."

22:46:16 You say to Constantine Stone, "Ready?"

22:46:23 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "They are if you're a mad guy with an agenda."

22:46:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That last headline was from ISN though."

22:46:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "They apparently are if you're nuts, and think you can prove something by trying to deny fact."

22:46:53 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "History is a story told by a winner, says something if he wants to disagree with it."

22:47:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wait, no it wasn't nevermind."

22:47:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Goddamnit."

22:47:12 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:47:17 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

22:47:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:47:19 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "ISN wouldn't say something like that."

22:47:22 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It was NEN. Whatever their initials stand for."

22:47:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:47:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's New Earth News."

22:47:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Five jumps to Olivia's Pearl Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:47:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:47:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

22:47:37 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, who knew."

22:47:38 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:47:39 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

22:47:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:47:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:47:41 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 4SJbse?Mgztm[{.Q7m}T'8`'hL(?sAO.B~biC)X/
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Four jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:47:42 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

22:47:42 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Eli did."

22:47:43 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:47:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:47:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:47:46 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:47:47 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

22:47:48 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:47:50 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, who else knew."

22:47:50 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:47:51 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:47:51 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:47:52 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

22:47:53 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:47:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:47:56 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I dunno."

22:47:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:47:57 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Olivia's Pearl Orbit."

22:47:58 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:47:59 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."

22:47:59 Via general sector communication, League Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2079 light-minutes per second from Galactic East and Very Slightly Down."

22:48:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:48:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:48:01 A large gas giant floats here, glowing bright white in the light of its suns. The surface appears regular and still, but certainly that's merely an illusion.

22:48:02 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (8, 4, 2)

22:48:08 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "About NEN, anyway."

22:48:19 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: (15, 15, 15).

22:48:20 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Brainwashing the masses into believing misinformation."

22:48:23 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:48:54 You poke Constantine Stone in the ribs!

22:48:57 [Starship "Herding Cats"; Control Room]

22:48:57 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a rare black EAOSian contoured couch and an early warning space defense device here.
Constantine Stone is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.)

22:49:03 You grin.

22:49:09 Constantine Stone says, "Sorry."

22:49:11 You grin.

22:49:16 You say, "Go for it."

22:49:17 Constantine Stone scrambles to his feet.

22:49:18 Constantine Stone walks south.

22:49:20 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (18, 10, 8)

22:49:22 You cannot do that while the ship is moving.

22:50:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:50:02 You press a button marked MODULE BAY DOOR.

22:50:03 A low vibration runs through the starship as the module bay door opens.

22:50:06 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Go for it."

22:50:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I hope the Velourian Times does a piece. I thought they were just as biased as NEN at the beginning of all this, but their publishing of my correction was mostly unbiased."

22:50:22 Constantine Stone's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Let me make sure I push the right one."

22:50:27 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Yep."

22:50:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ne`s!from _oice te=.inal i> best has tr@ed%t'*rea(sure public that !e +as!c|nsidered ever/thi]g r%g[@din} |ccor@ w?thdraw!"

23:00:50 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:00:50 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:00:51 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:00:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:00:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:00:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:00:57 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:01:30 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm sure NEN are being paid top rate to publish whatever they're told to."

23:01:31 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:01:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Probably."

23:02:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:02:08 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:02:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:02:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:02:23 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:02:26 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:02:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:02:28 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:02:58 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:09:43 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "EAOS."

23:10:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That was blown up by Outsiders."

23:10:39 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

23:10:43 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Excellent work on our first performance goal! Let's go for the second!"

23:11:08 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It is interesting that he didn't flat out say that."

23:11:39 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "It'd go right against what Best said if he did."

23:11:42 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Or he did and they published only part of his statement."

23:12:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Quite possible Hakeem."

23:12:30 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well I mean, they said that he said they originated elsewhere. Technically saying Grenwold would take up less space than elsewhere."

23:12:51 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Wouldnt get the same attention."

23:13:05 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mmhmm. Gotta spin it."

23:13:18 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Two pieces of news instead of one."

23:13:19 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "On the contrary. An outright intelligent man saying "hey morons, felo originated on Grenwold"? That'd get a lot of attention."

23:13:30 [General Communication] Damien Alexander chuckles.

23:13:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

23:14:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

23:16:55 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Effervescent Zephyr". The organization has earned 206,765.78 credits.

23:26:02 The damage control systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

23:26:18 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:26:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:44:06 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

23:44:06 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

23:44:08 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:44:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:44:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:44:10 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

23:44:14 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:44:14 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:44:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:44:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Mir. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:44:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:44:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Mir."

23:44:32 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "That's about as much up as me!"

23:44:33 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:44:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:44:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:44:37 The darkened, airless hulk of the Mir space station looms in the distance. Its existence as a busy neutral port ended abruptly when an Outsider phased destabilizing beam pierced the center of the station. Clouds of sparkling debris still mark the weapon's entry and exit points.

23:44:39 Via general sector communication, Mir transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to Mir."
