Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

It's cool and dry in this cell, the walls made of sterile painted granite. 
There is a thin bunk with scratchy sheets, a stainless steel toilet, and little
else. A heavily barred door is in place, thick and solid.
You see a small stainless steel toilet, a small transparisteel mirror bolted
securely above the toilet, and a narrow bunk here.
The cell door is open. You may go out.

This common area for the prison's inmates is a rather bleak place with gray
stone walls, a gray tile floor kept spotlessly clean by free convict labor, and
several security cameras conspicuously placed to catch every word and action no
matter how small and trivial. In the center of the room, a gray sofa, several
metal chairs, and a plastic table are bolted to the floor in a conversational
grouping. A small window in one side wall provides access to a prison postal
machine.

Notice from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst
The Stars: Kim accidentally didn't include SEAS when she purchased several Power
Plants which are being incorporated in Temporary Stations. This is why we
weren't included onthe latest Xenology station in Orion. If you can wait to turn
in Artifacts, please keep checking the Range office to see which stations SEAS
is included in to include the Xenology Station and then turn in your Artifacts
at that time. If you really need the funds, then by all means, do what is best
for you. Things will eventually get back to normal and the others with the
exception of Goodwin and Goss are cooperating in good faith to include SEAS when
possible. [10:17 11 October 2317 GST]

[Dure; Spaceport Trading Center]
The trading center seems to be one of the busiest places in the spaceport. Which
is not surprising, considering the profits that successful trading can bring in.
Avoiding the automated computer terminals used by the career traders, you decide
to approach a human trade clerk. This, incidentally, will also subject your
purchases and sales to less scrutiny.
You can go west.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

Hello Love, I am in big trouble! I absent-mindedly went out of the ship without
any clothes on earlier today. I totally was absorbed in what I needed to do and
I forgot to get dressed. I'm so shocked and I absolutely didn't realize i was
totally naked until I just received the notification that there's a warrant out
for my arrest. i am going to New Earth now to turn myself in but I am afraid to
attempt to put you in your Flare so you will have to come get it if I can't get
you out of Dove. i'm going to try to at least boot you out onto the landing pad
here on Old Frontier as the station will be closed soon. Anyway, you know where
i'll be when they take me in. I love you and i am so sorry! I am so very shocked
as I totally didn't recognize that I hadn't gotten dressed. I'll love you
forever, - Lily

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Dure; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair
here.

narrow but extends far back, giving it enough room to seat quite a few people.
The light from the suspended lamps is warm and easy on the eyes, casting

[Starship "The Storm Petrel"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.

[Starship "The Storm Petrel"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is
in space.
You see a swiveling black leather gunner's chair, an improved temporary wormhole
drive, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go north and south.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Would you say the
fighter in this store is worth it? I've not found many, or any space combat
missions other than those on svp, and I already have the cargo hauler..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I still use the
fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's the only
fighter we can buy that has a jump drive, so yeah, I think it's worth it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You will
eventually do beacon drops in them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The fighter can
be upgraded a lot. And become a really good fighter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Plus it's nice
to be able to respond to threats in a one-person ship, if need be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. what Stone
said."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Supposedly we
have a new fighter coming when we leave the Accord, and it's pretty nice, but
the point requirements are a bit higher."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "True that. Are their
other places to get missions for one of my... low... status?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "SVP and low
priorty deployments are your bread and butter. I'll run a nest in a little bit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Ah that reminds me!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Once you have
1000 industry you can do accord salvage missions. I forget the requirement for
combat, it might be 500."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Many people run
beacons, that you can join, too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I need to go see if
I can buy one of those hermes ships."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sadly, cadets
are just limited to those three ships in the New Phoenix spaceport shop."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Feh!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I know."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "You can't be
serious. I can't get a hermes ship?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think
so, but you can always try. Go to Luna, it won't put you out as much timewise."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie sounding decidedly grumpy: so I'm just
suppose to salvage, all day long?
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "No, the three
cadet ships are what we're limited to, till we get our full licenses."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not even.
There's low priorities, tesla, nests, I can take you asteroid hauling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a wide
universe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Tesla... yes, I need
to research that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Jade Burkley transmits, "How many points
do you need for hauling?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Anyone can haul
whenever, but you need a full license to get the ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I forget the
license requirements, but they aren't high."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Jade Burkley transmits, "I have 10 now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "Do let me know if
and when you run a nest, sir. I would be most interested."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They might be a
bit higher than that, but you'll get there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Will do, Katie."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I think we should
claim the spinward cluster."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...am I correct to understand that
point caps are 100 in all categories for cadets without an approved concept and
250 for cadets with an approved concept but no approved profile?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "As far as I know, yes."
[Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just double checking. Thanks. Thought I
was missin somethin."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Something rather."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "100 is so low."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It used to be 25."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ehh...it was 25 when I was a cadet."

[Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not really."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You guys are spoiled."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew laughs.
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It took me like three weeks to reach 100
in every single catigory, and that was with me doing literally everything I
could possibly do."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm glad they made the changes. I think
it makes things a lot easier on cadets overall. Having only 25 in any category
can be tough. 250 once you get your concept approved is beyond reasonable."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Do battle suits automatically get
refurbished?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If they're destroyed, no."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been

If they're destroyed or go back into storage, then no."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "For me I would think not having the
ships is what would make it really boring, but maybe the low points limits
motivate people."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Or is there something I need to manually do
repair it while it's in the shop?"
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's when you do things with groups
though."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, check the menu Justin."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They repair even if stored."
[Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was starting on my concept at 25
points.. just saying. And.. I capped at 100 in... a week or so? That's with RP
with everyone else too. 100 is very nice."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh do they? That I did not know."
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "That suit is heavily damaged. It cannot be
deployed until it is refurbished."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...so do the refurbishment in the
menu."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Then that means it was destroyed and
you'll have to get the referb...what Morris said."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes?"
[Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If you're capped at 100 you're waiting
on your concept to be approved. I know hosts have been busy lately, sometimes we
as players, who have way too much time on our hands, just have to be patient."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "That stuff I picked
up when we did a nest together, it's still in my battlesuit. What should I do
with it?"

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Keep it. It's useful for crafting. Do you have a workbench yet?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's not that they just look at it and
aprove or reject. They give you back lots and lots of feedback."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie Celayla transmits, "I don't."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They are. They give amazing feedback.
They don't just look at something and reject it, they actually tell you what
needs fixed and give you ideas. It takes time...and they have families, jobs,
school, and such."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "However! If you want to play your char
as impatient about it, feel free. Just hopefully you as the player realize
what's really going on."

[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It's all a conspiracy!"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What is?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Everything."
[Newbie Help] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, I know, Morris. I know. But,
doesn't mean it's not frustrating to have concepts constantly not-approved.
Then, having to wait more time.. to see weather that is approved or not. Then
find out that it's not approved, just because you're having trouble getting a
concept you want, across, in a single sentance. Which, is the frustrating
part... on top of that, you had a well worded, fairly decent profile all nicely
prepared.. then loose it, because your computer was being bumb and the program
you were using it on, 'deactivates' and can't save it.. and... ugh. -- It's just
been one of those days."

[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "He's been coordinating this
conspiracy."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If they're being denied, pay careful
attention to what hosts are telling you. If you follow directions and only
change what they ask, you'll be ok."

[Space Station Delta; Dock]
Though simply constructed and without the usual amenities, this enormous dock
provides space for dozens of ships. Starships periodically enter the dock,
thrusters burning against the sudden change to artificial gravity. A few of the
surfaces are a cold metallic gray, dirty with years of exhaust, though most have
been recently replaced and gleam under the bright recessed lighting in the
walls. Wide corridors lead into the station to the northwest and northeast. A
wide ramp leads down below the station to the asteroid mining facility.
The four-person mule "Faces Of Artemis", the vostok-class capsule "Fascination",
and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see a small trash can and an automatic teller machine here.
