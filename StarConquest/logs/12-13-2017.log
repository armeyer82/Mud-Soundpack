00:07 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

00:09 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

00:11 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

00:17 A long chartreuse soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:26 A long chartreuse soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:42     * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

00:53 A long chartreuse soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a string of light purple plastic kelp.

01:03 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a red glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:06 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Camp at 1:00."

01:06 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What tiers?"

01:06 [Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Dunno till we see who is coming."

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "K. Anythin but this tier 1 AEU please."

01:07 [Tactical Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "I can maybe do this thing."

01:17 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

01:20 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:29 A large semi-transparent perfectly round creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:36 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:37 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:38 Lily Kaise sighs.

01:38 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:38 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

01:38 You say to Lily, "I wish you could come with me."

01:39 Lily Kaise says, "Love you don't have to go permanently. You know I can't work as much either but just be here when you can. I will not leave you. I am here for you and I always will be."

01:39 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I know."

01:39 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:40 You say, "I may still pop in from time to time."

01:40 Lily Kaise says, "Seriously, you don't have to take drastric measures. Just lighten your workload and just be here when you can."

01:42 You say, "I still think I should resign as SDC. I'd rather have someone that can be here more often to do that."

01:42 Mischief the old large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

01:42 Lily Kaise says, "Well that is understandable and you know I wish someone would run for GSL but I'll hang-in as long as I can but I wouldn't be unhappy if someone ran for the office."

01:43 You nod to Lily Kaise.

01:43 Lily Kaise says, "I don't believe I am giving it what I should but I'm just not available enough."

01:43 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:43 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

01:43 You say, "Neither am I."

01:43 Lily Kaise asks, "Still who would though?"

01:43 A large semi-transparent perfectly round creature with long dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:43 Lily Kaise says, "There's nobody who can do what you do."

01:43 Lily Kaise says, "Other than Ather and he's in the Voice position."

01:44 You say, "I don't know. I'm sure Eli or Ather could do a much better job at it than me."

01:44 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Well where's Eli he hasn't been around for several days!"

01:45 You nod.

01:45 Lily Kaise says, "I'm beginning to wonder if the scandal he and Evenia has caused has gotten to his conscience."

01:45 Lily Kaise says, "Which in all fairness, isn't truly his fault I just believe he's been in denial as he didn't truly know the extent of her deception."

01:46 You say, "It may have, but he and Ather know way more than I do. I just don't feel like I'm the best for the position."

01:46 Lily Kaise says, "You are Love."

01:46 Lily Kaise says, "You don't see Eli out there flying cruiser anything."

01:46 "I don't think anyone knew." You nod to Lily Kaise. "Well, some of us do."

01:46 You say, "Or did."

01:46 Lily Kaise nods to you.

01:46 Mischief the old large black felo jumps onto a dark purple leather captain's chair and immediately settles in.

01:46 Mischief the old large black felo lies down and curls up into a tight ball, closes its eyes, and appears to sleep.

01:46 Lily Kaise says, "Well Apparently Nis did."

01:46 Lily Kaise strokes the soft fur of Mischief the old sleeping large black felo.

01:46 Mischief the old sleeping large black felo bats at Lily Kaise in its sleep.

01:46 You say, "Yeah, and Melinda and I did too."

01:47 You stroke the soft fur of Mischief the old sleeping large black felo.

01:47 Mischief the old sleeping large black felo rolls over on its side, snoring gently.

01:47 You say, "Thank goodness she didn't drag me into it."

01:47 I don't understand that.

01:47 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

01:47 Lily says to Mischief the old sleeping large black felo, "You're sleeping on the job!"

01:47 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:47 You laugh.

01:48 Lily says to you, "Please don't go away because you're embarrassed. I know everyone involved respects you and are as proud of you as I am that you had the courage to speak up."

01:48 You say, "And honestly, I haven't flown cruiser in a long time either."

01:48 Lily Kaise says, "It's ok."

01:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:49 Lily Kaise says, "'Still you are knowledgeable and you are qualified. There really isn't nayone else at this time who I think would assume the position or do as well as you are even part time."

01:50 You say to Lily, "And I truly hope that Evenia doesn't start making up stories about me and her. I wouldn't put it past her."

01:51 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

01:54 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:55 Lily Kaise says, "Well as long a syou are truthful with me, the only person I will believe will be you. Besides, I am the one you spend the majority of your sleeping time with and when you don't it's justifiable."

01:55 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:55 Lily Kaise beams at you.

01:55 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

01:55 You say to Lily, "I love you and only you."

01:55 Lily Kaise says, "I'll even go so far..."

01:56 You ask, "So far as...?"

01:57 Lily Kaise says, "That if you did happen to stray while we were together and you did remain true to your heart and withdrew from the relationship with her, you know I wouldn't be happy but the most important thing is you have remained with me."

01:58 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

01:58 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

01:58 Lily Kaise says, "I'd like to think that you haven't though."

01:58 You say, "I haven't."

01:59 You say, "And I won't get involved with anyone else without you giving your permission."

02:00 Lily Kaise says, "I didn't think so."

02:00 You smile at Lily Kaise.

02:00 Lily Kaise says, "I think you would have a difficult time hiding it if you did."

02:01 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:01 Lily Kaise says, "Would you want me to do anything on the side? I really don't think so."

02:02 Lily Kaise says, "We've certainly established that fact."

02:02 Lily Kaise grins at you.

02:02 You grin at Lily Kaise.

02:02 You say, "No, I'd much rather you not doing things on the side, especially without me knowing."

02:03 Lily Kaise says, "That's only fair and same here but trust me Love, it's not going to happen."

02:03 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I know. I trust you."

02:04 Lily says to you, "I trust you too. I'll admit it that earlier on, I wasn't sure how you'd go but you've been wonderful."

02:04 You say, "That doesn't mean that while I'm around that you can't have fun. If others are flashing or whatever, feel free to join in. In fact, please do so I can stare at you instead of them."

02:05 Lily Kaise chuckles.

02:05 Lily Kaise says, "Well there's only about one environment where I'd feel comfortable with that sort of thing."

02:05 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

02:05 You say, "I know."

02:14 You say, "I mean, would not touch other women."

02:14 Lily says to you, "Well I suppose it woulsn't be fair to you to tell you that you couldn't be around other women. Just try to consider though that you would be inticing them into a relationship."

02:16 You say, "Like I said, I'd be upfront with them, and it'd probably just be a soft relationship anyways."

02:16 Lily Kaise says, "If you were to go for an indefinite period of time, I'm not even going to consider anotehr relationship at all."

02:16 You say, "Then I won't either."

02:17 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:17 Lily Kaise says, "Well that's just me. I'm very loyal and as you know, I wasn't looking for a relationship when I became a pilot."

02:18 You say, "I know you weren't. So imagine my surprise when this cute women with your name kissed me on the cheek. But seriously, only fair. If you won't. I won't either."

02:19 You say, "I don't want to seem disloyal."

02:19 Lily Kaise says, "Well Love, if I were to leave and not give you some idea of when I would return, I couldn't expect you to go on without someone."

02:20 You say, "I'd want your permission first and as soon asyou came back, I'm jumping back into your arms."

02:21 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah but what about the other person?"

02:21 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:21 You say, "If they weren't ok with that, then I wouldn't get involved in the first place."

02:25 You exclaim, "You couldn't pay me to get involved with her!"

02:27 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah but you see she had access to our private space and I do think she took some soldiers out of Daisy May. I did tell her she could have some but it seemed fairly obvious that there were very few felo in there one time when she still had access so I was glad to delete her keys."

02:27 Lily Kaise says, "Speaking of which I need to go look around but I don't htink I have the inclination to do so this morning."

Lily Kaise is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

12:15 You kiss Lily Kaise.

12:15 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Chopsticks". The organization has earned 2,517,393.26 credits.

12:15 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

12:15 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]

12:15 You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing fuchsia and violet aquatic life and coral rocks, a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, and Cheri-Pye the old large light violet felo here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

12:15 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]
You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a personal hoverpallet, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

12:15 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

12:15 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

12:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

12:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:15 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

12:15 I don't understand that.

12:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:16 I don't understand that.

12:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:16 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

12:16 There appear to be 6 pilots recently active.

12:16 The communicator network detects:

Want to know if anyone's relaxing in a public venue? Check WHERE!

12:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:16 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:16 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

12:16 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:16 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

12:16 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

12:16 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

12:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:16 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:16 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

12:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

12:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

12:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

12:17 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:17 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:17 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:17 You scramble to your feet.

12:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

12:17 You exit the ship.

15:23 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

17:44 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I mean, think about it. Even on the clipper, there's a 15 percent bonus. Figure out how much damage that equates to."

17:45 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "With all 12 lasers having that bonus."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's 2 extra damage per turret."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, assuming you use the 15 damage lasers."

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also, even with a good engineer you'll be waiting on the grid in the clipper, reducing its overall speed."

17:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "However, it can really clear a fighter quickly."

17:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that's something."

17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, at the same time, the clipper can get away really fast. So, it's kind of a hit and run ship. It has the power to break failsafes and then run off."

17:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I mean that's the real trick. Our ships are set up in specific ways to be good at specific things."

17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Whereas the cruiser is just built for power."

17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In practice a lot of us probably don't use them for those things often, just because we don't see the situations come up."

17:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Right. One has to keep in mind that many of our ships are meant to be support ships. So, if you get a clipper in there to just break failsafes and then have someone else's ship beat the living daylights out of the enemy. It makes more sense. Even having a cruiser there is a formidable combination."

17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's true."

17:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Some of our ships get engine boosts for that exact reason."

17:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "In fact, Ather often jumps in with his clipper to just launch bolts at the enemy."

17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "And good luck catching his ship."

17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it would be good for that."

17:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hence why I like AEU pilots to learn how to fly from other AEU pilots. At least learn a few things from AEU pilots. Other alliance ships are set up differently and so things have to be taken into consideration. A league ship is designed to take a lot more damage than our ships, but our ships get engine boosts."

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places.

20:02 --

20:02 Lily,
I spoke to Kim earlier about providing a few slow burning fusion things. With the new thermal reclamation modules, we can get the small beacon stations (776, 286) to last just over two months if we put them on the slow burners. When I spoke to her, she wasn't sure you'd want to spend the megacredits. Your cost (for those two) would come out to 6 megacredits per month. She went ahead and put three with just Starseekers in her warehouse. If you don't mind her spending vassal megacredits, can you write to her and let her know? I didn't figure you would mind since you're wanting to help out, but she didn't want to spend it without your goahead. Anyway, I have enough for a couple months, plus one of the stations for longer, so you've got time to think about it if necessary.

Thanks,
Morris

20:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:42 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Teslaworld Orbit."

20:42 There are no other ships in the sector.

20:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:43 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:43 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

20:43 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:43 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

20:44 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:44 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

20:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:44 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

20:45 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.
