00:18 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

00:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Beta.
You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into.

01:30 Who?

01:30 Who?

01:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is now able to enter this living quarters.

01:30 You say, "There."

01:30 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Three]

01:30 Crystal clear water fills the fishbowl, and a layer of gravel on the floor creates a natural looking substrate. A bubbling plastic treasure chest in the center is guarded by a plastic diver wearing a diving bell, and a kelp-like neon green plastic plant waves around, anchored into the gravel. A large goldfish and several tetras inhabit the fishbowl, along with a snail. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, and Magellan the arachnoid security robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go out.

01:30 The group of tetras zooms around the bowl in tight circles.

01:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "Were you able to dock your ship?"

01:30 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yep."

01:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yay."

01:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh ok well guess unless you want to do some crafting, things will be ok."

01:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:31 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops."

01:31 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

01:32 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:32 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:32 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're just transitioning on to the next beacon."

01:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

01:32 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:32 Lily says to you, "It's ok to be in the control room. Pressing the rift and the Location buttons don't seem to get in anyone's way anymore."

01:32 You say to Lily, "We rescued my flare."

01:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

01:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Awesome!"

01:33 You say, "Oh, ok. Cool."

01:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I did hear that and I so wanted to go along but I couldn't."

01:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have a 3 and a 5."

01:35 You say, "Cool. Bring your five."

01:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I set up KitCat in the sightseer to feed the fish so other than extra eggs and departed fishies, they should be ok."

01:35 You grin.

01:35 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I put them in the store room."

01:36 You say, "Ok."

01:55 A Tardick lizard named Thor turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

01:57 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

01:59 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:59 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:59 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

02:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:17 Johann Schraft elbows into Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident as he tries to work with the long range scanner controls.

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:18 Johann Schraft asks, "Hmm?"

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh I just got in your way."

02:18 Johann Schraft says, "Oh."

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:18 Johann Schraft says, "I didn't notice."

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "No big!"

02:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Do you still see them?"

02:18 Johann Schraft says, "Yep."

02:40 Johann Schraft says, "Oh, I forgot to throw on a forecaster. Oh well. Not like knowing the flow is going to suck will change anything."

02:40 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

02:41 Melinda Michaels says, "Can't have one on this ship."

02:41 Johann Schraft says, "Ahh, well, there goes that idea then."

02:41 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:49 Johann Schraft says, "Yep, 273 is as far as I think I'm going to hop to bed afterwords."

02:50 Melinda Michaels says, "Okay, I'll stay awake till we're out of 274."

02:50 Johann Schraft nods.

02:50 Johann Schraft says, "Thanks."

02:50 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

02:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:51 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:51 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

02:51 The computer announces, "Autoforward beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Debris Beacon Alpha 274 in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:51 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

02:51 Johann Schraft exclaims, "Okay. Goodnight everyone!"

02:51 Melinda Michaels says, "Night."

02:51 Johann Schraft stands up from a black leather captain's chair.

02:51 Johann Schraft walks south.

02:51 Raiatea the arachnoid security robot skitters after Johann Schraft.

02:52 [Newbie Help] Tamra Swenson transmits, "How do the fish packets work commands fish say use fish with something but what?"

02:52 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Your aquarium."

02:52 [Newbie Help] Tamra Swenson transmits, "But there's coy fish here."

02:53 [Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh those fish, try feed fish."

02:53 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The fish food you buy at the Torus is not the same stuff you use on those fish."

02:54 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The packets do work on aquariums though for the record."

02:54 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That I didn't know. That's kind of cool."

03:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:01 [Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "Is it normal to only get about 300 k or less wen salvaging? I thought you could upgrade the salvaging stuff."

03:02 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can once you have more points to qualify for it."

03:02 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That's normal. Upgrading the salvaging stuff just means you can salvage higher grade debris. If you salvage the same debris it won't change much."

03:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Both debris grade and how much you turn in affect your payout. SO bigger storage and the debris itself being a higher grade, which you'll need a better grapple to salvage, will cause you to get paid more."

03:03 [Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It will come pretty quickly once you can upgrade."

03:03 [Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "What are the point requirements? And is it on the landing pad or on the second floor."

03:04 [Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "For fringe ours is south of the ship shop on level 2."

03:04 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "There are lots and lots of different grapples."

03:04 [Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Get a copy of fringe starships and upgrades it has info."

03:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:16 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

03:21 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:24 [Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "Where is the medical place so I can heal my self? In Chetumal."

03:24 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Try typing something like find mmedical."

03:24 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can use the find command to help you find things like that."

03:24 [Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Down level 2 north east from the hub."

03:24 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "It only works if you're relatively close, and if there are no go exits involved."

03:25 [Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "It will on our medical center though."

03:25 [Newbie Help] Daniel Blackwell transmits, "Also, the display on level two has directions for most things."

03:26 An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

03:31 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

03:34 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:34 A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 270.0, -2.0.

03:34 Melinda Michaels flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board, then pushes a heavy lever forward.

03:34 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:34 Melinda Michaels presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

03:34 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:34 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

03:35 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

03:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh well flow isn't in our favor."

03:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:40 Melinda Michaels quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.

03:40 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 270.0, -1.0.

03:42 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 150281816 at North and Very Slightly Up: "Hey Mel, can you hear us?"

03:42 Melinda Michaels carefully turns a few small knobs on the broadcaster control board.

03:42 A number flap display rapidly flips around to indicate that the broadcaster is now aimed at 90.0, 1.0.

03:42 Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "We can."

03:43 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 150281816 at North and Very Slightly Up: "What's our heading outta the beacon chain?"

03:44 Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "My heading is 270 negative 1 is what I am doing for now. If the flow keeps pushing up, we'll need to adjust later."

03:44 Incoming hypercaster transmission from Unknown Contact 150281816 at North and Very Slightly Up: "Ok. Thank you."

03:44 Melinda Michaels says into the hypercaster microphone, "Yup."

03:45 Melinda Michaels activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

03:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:53 Aisling the Fox prances in from the south.

03:53 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:53 Melinda Michaels says, "Hey."

03:53 Aisling the Fox waves.

03:53 Aisling the Fox sits down on a large leather couch.

03:55 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

12:35 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, lead chunks, not led chunks, they are getting your typo."

12:35 [Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Happens to near everybody at some point. Don't sweat it too much."

12:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

12:40 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

12:48 The curtains close, to no applause.

12:48 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

12:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:09 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

13:13 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:19 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

13:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

13:30 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

13:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:50 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

13:50 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

13:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:09 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

14:50 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

14:51 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

15:20 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

15:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

15:31 A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

15:41 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

15:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:49 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Could someone let me know the command to duplicate keys please?"

15:49 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Duplicate."

15:49 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Duplicate."

15:50 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Right I knew that part.. do I need the title or the key in my hand?"

15:51 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "The key."

15:51 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You need the key."

15:51 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Ok thanks much."

15:51 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If you had the title you'd use the make command."

15:51 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Make naem of ship or what is that command that is with the title?"

15:51 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Just make."

15:51 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Thanks."

15:51 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

15:53 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

15:53 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

15:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:59 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

15:59 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

16:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:09 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Going to bed Mel?"

16:09 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

16:14 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

16:14 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

16:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a cup of hot French vanilla coffee.

16:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

16:44 The starship groans slightly under the tremendous pressure of the water pushing on the hull.

16:54 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

17:04 Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

17:15 Below the starship, an underwater canyon comes into view. It is so deep that even the bright floodlights of the starship cannot penetrate the darkness.

17:16 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

17:16 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

17:30 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

17:35 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

17:35 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

17:36 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

18:05 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

18:16 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

18:26 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

18:36 The ship plops out into a large open pink fleshy space, landing in a pool of fluids. After a moment, the organ contracts and pushes it into another tunnel.

18:37 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

18:37 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

19:07 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

19:28 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

19:38 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

19:38 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

19:47 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

20:08 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

20:11 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

20:39 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, the ship appears to be back in space.

20:40 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

20:50 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

20:59 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

21:33 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

21:42 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

21:42 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

21:44 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

22:01 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

22:11 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What do we do to get the best use out of debris sensors? I feel like I want to scan for the closest debris then head for it, but does that fit the actual intent of it? For sure, it's a little tough for me to figure out the coordinates based on the vector from my position at this point."

22:11 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Since it helps determine the type of debris and grade, it will help you make a dicision based on that."

22:12 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And as your points go up, you will get sensors that will make that easier still."

22:12 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For example, if you're supposed to get bari corpses for SVP, you can scan and only go for the bari corpses. Or if you wanted only comet for a reason, then you can go to only comets. Or only the higher grade...or whatever. And yes, your sensors will eventually scan the entire sector."

22:12 The island passes through a thick, fluffy cloud, coating everything in a refreshingly cool mist, before it emerges on the other side.

22:13 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Roger that. So when I see something I want, how do I go to it? Sounds like a stupid question but, are people just using manual mode or something."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Personally I find the coordinates of the chunk I want, and then put those coordinates into the computer."

22:13 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. You can move to its coordinates. So...if you're at 10 10 10 and there's two chunks in range, look at the rundown and find the one that matches up the closest in direction and distance."

22:14 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok."

22:14 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "When you have a better scanner, you'll notice that there are as many debris chunks as there are on the rundown when it scans. They're displayed in the same order on both."

22:14 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "With the early sensors, it can be as easy to just find the chunks on the rundown and move to each in turn."

22:23 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

22:34 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

22:44 The outcrop gently spins around in a circle, providing a panoramic view of the landscape below.

22:44 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

22:44 [Newbie Help] Led chuncks Jake Smith transmits, "Is there a way to turn the confermation for fireing and for moveing out of the sectors?"

22:44 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:44 [Newbie Help] Led chuncks Jake Smith transmits, "Turn it off."

22:44 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "They're two different things."

22:45 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For moving out of sectors, you want PROMPT."

22:45 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, type prompt while in the control room for sector exit prompts."

22:45 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Ok got it. What about the other."

22:45 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For firing, there's a device that can be purchased, but keep in mind it is considered illegal in alliance space."

22:45 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Yo yo yo, strange. Nvm then. Haha."

22:46 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That doesn't mean you can't or shouldn't use it. Just be aware of the possible outcome."

22:51 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:51 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:51 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:51 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

22:53 The flock banks smoothly, moving as one.

22:53 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

22:54 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

23:33 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

23:44 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

23:48 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

23:54 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

23:54 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

23:58 [Newbie Help] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There's some timelines on the web site that give more of the history than the help files do, one sec let me see if I can find it again."
