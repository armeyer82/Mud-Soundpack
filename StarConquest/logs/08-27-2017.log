00:07:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well that's he last place I'd get into trouble but you know, I am just a little uncomfortable with walking out of anywhere without any clothes on. When I went swimming nude in the ocean, I always had a cover up on before I went in and just came out and put it back on."

00:07:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

00:08:11 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "I understand. That was my mistake."

00:17:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

00:18:16 You laugh.

00:18:48 You say to Lily, "So woould you have been more comfortable if we had walked out of the ship at NQ with clothes on and I had stripped you after we left the ship?"

00:19:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well just depends on the situation I guess."

00:19:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

00:19:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I mean don't you think it's a little odd to just come out and start stripping? I'd say going topless or such initially but I don't know. I."

00:19:50 You nod.

00:19:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

00:20:35 You say, "Ok, sorry."

00:22:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or Navy too or one of our own obviously."

00:23:21 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:24:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I suppose those are Transports all of the time though or they couldn't carry much cargo."

00:24:48 You say, "Which are? I'm just listening to the alliance sectors."

00:25:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The merchant ships."

02:02:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:02:35 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

13:13:04 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:13:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:17:45 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

13:17:46 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:18:06 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Test."

13:18:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:18:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:18:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

13:18:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

13:18:21 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

13:18:42 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

15:52:09 You sit down on a dark green leather captain's chair.

15:52:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:52:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on your lap.

15:52:19 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:52:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:52:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:52:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:52:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

15:52:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

15:52:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

15:52:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:52:28 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station to Providence Gate flight control, we record an inbound AEU corvette."

15:52:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.

15:53:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

15:57:00 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:57:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on Shule Elemmire's lap.

17:49:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

17:49:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on Shule Elemmire's lap.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

18:02:16 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:02:16 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:02:17 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:02:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:02:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:02:32 The ship is already moving.

18:02:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:02:34 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Hoyt Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:28:55 a dark green leather captain's chair

18:28:55 This state of the art starship captain's chair is upholstered in dark green leather and has a polished steel frame. The high back, seat, and armrests are firmly but deeply padded to mitigate the vibrations, shaking, and sudden changes of velocity of both normal starship operations and combat. The chair swivels smoothly from side to side to provide an extended reach of control room instrument panels.
On top of it you see a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small neon pink dragonflies and a dark pink lace bullet bra.

18:29:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

18:29:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I hope the police weren't out there..."

18:29:44 You say, "If they were, you would have already gotten a notice over your communicator if you did something wrong."

18:30:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:30:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:30:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth flight control here, we have an AEU corvette launch."

18:30:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:30:53 You say, "I need to doze for a bit so I'll take us back to The Torus."

18:30:57 Which sector did you mean?

18:33:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:35:32 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Wow, did they go early, or have they gone very fast."

18:35:40 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "They left early."

18:35:56 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "They also have the beacon network to speed things up."

18:36:12 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yeah, it doesn't speed you up that much though."

18:36:24 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "That depends on the flow."

18:36:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, yeah, but to get out of comms in half an hour would have been something."

18:37:05 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Like I said, they left early."

18:37:14 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Around three hours early."

18:42:00 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I heard somebody say they had to do a mission and a half because of people doing that with missions the other day."

18:42:18 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "How do you mean a mission and a half?"

18:43:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They must have had a wreck in the same place as one somebody else had, so when they thought they were full, they went back to Orion, and it didn't all count as their mission, so they had to go back out again."

18:43:24 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I've not heard of that happening before, but oh well."

18:43:50 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I've had something similar, two of us with missions in the same place at the same time, and one of the wrecks I did didn't count."

18:43:53 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I keep trying to fill up with a round hundred pieces, just because. So I end up expelling the larger pieces and taking twice as long to fill up."

18:44:28 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I couldn't be bothered, I'm not sure the extra rewards would be worth the extra time to me."

18:44:29 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Interalliance."

18:45:06 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I thought out meant out."

18:45:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And that just shows that pressure can pay off."

18:45:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

18:45:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Clearly Best does whatever suits him best at the time."

18:45:54 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Clearly."

18:46:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I will never trust him, he needs to go."

18:47:54 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "He's assuming the Accord will negotiate further."

18:48:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "As long as he stays within the timeframe set out in the agreement with Accord, he is entitled to put it on hold while he finds a new negotiator."

18:56:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

20:29:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Arguing with them is pointless, though. They don't trust us, and arguing won't help. For now let's just try to show them that we're all on the same side."

20:31:31 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:31:31 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

20:41:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

20:42:05 You say, "She just asked if we were busy."

20:42:15 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:42:15 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:42:21 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:42:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:42:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:42:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:42:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh sorry I need to take the earplugs out of my ears haha."

20:42:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:42:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Shall we meet you at New Earth?"

20:42:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:42:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:42:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Plechuckle."

20:42:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

20:42:44 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:42:46 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:42:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:42:48 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:42:48 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

20:42:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah. Im at the lounge there."

20:42:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.
The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 730" has jumped out of the sector.

20:42:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:42:53 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

20:42:55 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

20:43:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:43:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Constantine? You busy?"

20:43:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:43:19 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:43:19 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:43:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At the moment, yeah."

20:43:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a dark green leather captain's chair.

There is a quiet murmur of conversation, most of it emanating from the office staff as they coordinate activities between the pilot league and the government on the ground. One corner of the room is occupied by several comfortable chairs and decorative plants, and a man constantly wearing a reassuring smile sits at a desk there. A nameplate on his desk reads "CADET ORIENTATION." If a brand new cadet were confused, or just not sure where to begin, they would TALK to him.

20:59:41 A large cradle slides up from beneath and stops, displaying itself in the center of the room. Upon it is a clear oval-shaped shell, which contains an alien plant with silver spikes and reflective leaves.

20:59:44 Tara Flores says, "Oh! I've seen those on ships before."

20:59:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We only have one plant at the moment. Since we are a newer organizaiton, we weren't one of the original orgs who were able to get first cuttings."

21:00:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They are pretty expensive to obtain so in time we'll get a few more."

21:00:48 Tara Flores nods.

21:00:56 Tara Flores asks, "I'm guessing they take time to grow?"

21:01:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The one we do have is the Double-Laser plant and it is great."

21:01:16 Tara Flores asks, "What does that do?"

21:01:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It adds to the percentage of damage that lasers can effect."

21:01:51 Lily says to you, "Maybe has a better explanation."

21:01:53 Tara Flores says, "Oh, so an offensive upgrade."

21:01:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

21:02:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You do lose some of the damage output from Minicannons but we don't typically encourage anything but the use of lasers on AEU Combat ships."

21:03:01 Tara Flores asks, "Yeah, since the systems on the ships highly amplify the effect of lasers, right?"

21:03:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's a very small percentage that you lose so it's a very worthwhile plant on a Gunship or a pulsar and on a Cruiser."

21:03:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

21:03:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Tara Flores.

21:03:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person light transport "Non Serviam Redux". The organization has earned 491,606.72 credits.

21:03:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "On AEU combat shps though."

21:04:27 Tara Flores says, "Ah! I'll be getting a lot of those notifications, im guessing."

21:04:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we use some other Alliance ship, they aren't really going to effect more than they would for another alliance."

21:04:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "But they really are awesome for us!"

21:04:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

21:05:02 Tara Flores nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:05:26 Lily says to Tara, "For Organizaiton members, plant cuttings are free per the number of ships you have that are applicable."

21:05:31 Tara Flores says, "I still mainly use my Cadet fighter for combat."

21:05:43 Tara Flores nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:05:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah that's a ship you will probably have forever!"

21:05:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

21:05:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "A lot of us prefer them."

21:06:11 Tara Flores says, "I nearly took down an outsider corvette on my own in it."

21:06:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So when you're ready and need any plant cuttings we can provide, let us know."

21:06:28 Tara Flores says, "I think i'll manage it next time."

21:07:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Otherwise, jsut come up here anytime."

21:07:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

21:07:34 Tara Flores exclaims, "I'll come by here to look around again later!"

21:08:19 Lily says to Tara Flores, "Any questions?"

21:09:22 Tara Flores ponders a little "Whats the best way for me to help the organization out? right now?"

21:09:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh you don't need to do anything. We know you are just developing your skills and accumulating some funds."

21:10:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're here to help you along and always feel free to ask over the org Channel about anything."

21:11:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway, we know that you who are newer pilots put a lot aside for the strike. I don't hold it against you if you feel you need to work."

21:11:58 Tara Flores speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

21:11:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Remember what I said yesterday, if theres any time to strike its now."

21:12:03 You glance around at your surroundings.

21:13:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I agree with Eli but that is very wishful thinking. Unfortunately, Best is determined and he still doesn't get it obviously."

21:13:32 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

21:14:00 Tara Flores says, "A leader falls apart when he loses support of the people, so hopefully we can get more people agaisnt outtcord."

21:14:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Tara Flores.

21:14:11 You nod to Tara Flores. "True."

21:14:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It will take the other Citizens who aren't pilots though to really put pressure on him."

21:15:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So all we can do is pressure the other aspects like the merchant ships and anyone we possibly can."

21:15:49 You say, "Exactly."

21:16:04 Tara Flores says, "I mean come on, the negitator for outtcord itself tried to set up a way out, he clearly thought outtcord was bad."

21:16:15 You nod to Tara Flores.

21:16:28 Lily says to Tara, "You don't need to be hostile. Just say somethoug to them when you see them in a sector to discourage them from trading in AEU space."

21:16:43 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Anyone free to go hunting rats. There's at least 4 to 6 reapers in dusty reaches. Might be dangerous for cadets."

21:16:44 Tara says to Lily, "Yeah, I know."

21:17:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Something like Outccord must not go forward. Stop Outccord now or be creative."

21:17:09 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "About to go back but wanted a full hold of torps before I go."

21:18:37 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok never mind they left."

21:19:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It can be very busy at times but it means income, megacredits which we use to buy Modules for Temp Stations and Command points so it's a good thing although it can make for a busy display on your communicator at times."

21:19:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

21:19:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

21:19:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Ok miss tara, what is your favorite color?"

21:25:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Awesome!"

21:25:31 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

21:25:46 Tara looks over to a duo of pilots. "Thats been happening a lot lately."

21:25:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We're not the organizaiton with the most of everything but we're growing and thanks to pilots like you and Shule and Constantine and hopefully more in the future."

21:28:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As a member of an organization, you only need half the points to qualify for the points requirement of any of those ships except for the Cruiser."

21:28:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The Cruiser you'll need to have at least the lock evasions."

21:28:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

21:28:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So it won't be up for rent."

21:28:32 Tara Flores says, "I'm a long way from that still."

22:04:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 1,096,637.50 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.

22:04:43 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, that was you."

22:04:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

22:04:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was like gotta stop that trader!"

22:08:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah I can't use capsules yet."

22:09:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "True, and from what I understand, we can't buy anything from Mutuality ports anyway."

22:09:19 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe someday."

22:09:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "We can't. We can't even buy mutuality products that were sold in places closer. We can't buy the deep space battery that was sold at the drydock, for example."

22:10:00 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

22:10:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is curious, I didn't think the QSA agreement affected that. I asked their voice equivalent to clarify why for us."

22:13:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah hopefully if we beat outtcord we can beat this privitzation thing, then repair ties with the Mutuality. Ugh the thing that disgusts me the most about Best's campaigning is how he's trying to kick so many people out of our space."

22:14:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't asked the office about privitization yet. I was going to try to start addressing that after the Outccord stuff was over."

22:14:32 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I may call for a corps meeting once it is, and we can discuss an agenda for the future."

22:14:54 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know you want to get the AEU more involved in exploration, and so do I. I have a few ideas about how we might."

22:15:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Privatization might not be entirely bad, depending on what exactly it entails. We might be able to more easily convince a corporation that exploration can profit them, for example."

22:15:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But we will address that issue when it comes up."

22:16:52 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:16:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

22:17:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Just remember who the person that wants to privitaze the corporation is, and who the people of the pilot corps are acting agaisnt. My biggest fear is this will allow best himself more control over who can and can't be a pilot. Privtization in a nutshell means pulling a organziation out of the public sector into the private sector. Which means we'd also lose what little influence we have with the government entirely. At least, that's probably what Best wants to do. I hope im wrong."

22:18:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's why we didn't vote for the president who wanted privatization."

22:18:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not really sure about any of that. Best isn't the only one who has called for privatization -- another presidential candidate also did, and I think right now, most everyone would be happy to have him instead."

22:18:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Really it all depends on who controls the corps once it's privatized. It could be terrible, or it could be basically the same, or even better."

22:18:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We really have no way of knowing."

22:19:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Certainly Best wouldn't have control over who is and isn't a pilot unless he were the owner of the corps, though."

22:19:12 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Currently he does have control over that."

22:19:24 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And presidents have closed the corps off in the past."

22:19:29 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Beacons?"

22:19:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "The biggest question, would you rather work for the AEU itself and aid it as a whole, or work for a private corporation who probably doesn't give a damn about the well being of the masses."

22:20:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The corporation would still work for the AEU."

22:20:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "All I'm saying is we basically have no details about this."

22:22:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What if the corporation were pilot owned and run? There are a lot of possibilities."

22:22:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know what's in the cards though, obviously."

22:22:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I actually doubt Best has any concrete plan, either."

22:22:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Probably, he probably droped that bomb to distract people."

23:33:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I threw out seagull."

23:34:02 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

23:34:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

23:34:08 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

23:34:11 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

23:34:17 You ask, "So, to Old Earth?"

23:34:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:34:23 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh yeah Seagulls are definitely the scavenger type."

23:34:52 You ask, "Shall we go to Old Earth?"

23:34:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Sure!"

23:35:03 You're already sitting.

23:35:04 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:35:04 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:35:05 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:35:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:35:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:35:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then I can go fly it around and get it upgraded."

23:35:15 You grin.

23:35:19 The ship is already moving.

23:35:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:35:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:35:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:35:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

23:35:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:35:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:35:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:35:36 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

23:35:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:35:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok so tell me your choice we have three names!"

Destroyers:
Three-Person Light Escort 15,000,000.00 (New Earth Blazing Trails)
AS-0A AEU LIGHT ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 50 industry points        15 combat points
Model number: AS-0A                     Designation: Light Escort
Turret hardpoints: 10                   Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The light Escort is the first destroyer that an AEU pilot will ever have access to. It's a reasonably well armed vessel, with no major bonuses. However, it can still pack quite a punch, especially with more advanced upgrades and its single launcher.

Three-Person Heavy Defense Vessel 7,500,000.00 (Endymion)
AD-1N AEU HEAVY DEFENSE VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 100 industry points       250 combat points
Model number: AD-1N                     Designation: Heavy Defense Vessel
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 4
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The defense vessel is a very well armed vessel, holding 12 turrets. It does have a major disadvantage though, which like
23:42:21 ly also explains the cheaper cost. That disadvantage is that it has no FTL drive. However, it can still be a very useful ship, but just know if you want to take it anywhere you'll need to dock it inside a bigger ship, or tug it around using a tugboat.

Three-Person Clipper 200,000,000.00 (New Earth Allied Technologies)
AS-4F AEU CLIPPER-CLASS ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 750 industry points       750 combat points
Model number: AS-4F                     Designation: Clipper
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 14
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The Clipper is the most advanced destroyer that the AEU has. It's as armed as the defense vessel with 12 turrets, but has the further advantage of a vastly increased engine speed when it's going at maximum burn, and also has an extra hull failsafe over the other two destroyers.

23:42:36 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:42:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

23:42:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:42:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:43:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:43:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Deadly strike. You might be deadly, but your rusty landing struts prove that your owner doesn't look after you."

23:43:50 [General Communication] Rogue Romano snickers.

23:43:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

23:44:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:44:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:44:02 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

23:44:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:44:16 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:44:16 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:45:06 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:45:07 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:45:07 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:45:08 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:45:09 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is power to the Outsiders"

23:45:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:45:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:45:12 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:45:14 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Kalina! Welcome to home space!"

23:45:15 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

23:45:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Kalina. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:45:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:45:46 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Strangely enough. Her turrets are too clean. Not good shule. Not good at all."

23:45:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:45:54 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:45:55 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:50:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:50:24 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:50:24 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:50:25 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

23:50:28 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:50:29 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

23:50:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:50:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:50:31 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.

23:57:33 You can go south, up, and out.

23:57:39 You put down a decoy beacon launcher.

23:57:41 Once bolted down, this will be impossible to remove. Are you sure?

23:57:42 [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:57:45 You carefully set about bolting a decoy beacon launcher to a convenient surface.

23:57:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:57:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:57:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:57:52 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

23:57:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:58:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:58:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Aenea Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:58:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:58:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

23:58:18 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:58:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:58:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:58:22 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:58:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Aenea Orbit."

23:58:23 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:58:24 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Registered merchants, trading at Union ports funds plans that will endanger human lives. Profit for Best is Power to the Outsiders.""

23:58:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:58:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:58:27 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Aenea in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:58:29 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

23:58:29 Via general sector communication, Aenea transmits, "Hello there, Albatross! Welcome to home space!"

23:58:30 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Aenea.

23:58:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:58:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:58:59 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:59:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Albatross. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

23:59:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:59:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:59:14 Life support cannot be without power while this ship is in a hostile environment.

23:59:16 [Starship "Albatross"; Airlock]

23:59:16 You can go out and enter into the ship.

23:59:18 You are not currently wearing a spacesuit. Do you wish to suit up now?

23:59:18 [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:59:19 You remove spacesuit components from a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side and quickly don them.

23:59:22 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

23:59:25 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

23:59:27 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow. Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

23:59:37 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

23:59:39 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

23:59:45 You exit the ship.
