00:00:08 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is that?"

00:00:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "SVP? Same place you got that mission. Space Vermin Patrol Command."

00:01:04 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm. I'll have to check that out."

00:05:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Alright, the tech says that they're pretty much just regular electronic binoculars. He said they were pretty standard gear for patrolling a planet."

00:05:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

00:06:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, that doesn't really give us much."

00:06:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They can identify certai meterials, but mostly they're just binoculars."

00:06:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Good to know."

00:06:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We don't know what materials, do we?"

00:06:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No he just said a rudimentary identification of materials."

00:07:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, okay."

00:07:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably if something is made out of plasteel,  or whatever."

00:07:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

00:08:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, I'm going to get some shuteye. I'll be around in a bit."

00:08:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, take care."

00:15:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Learn anything else about it?"

00:16:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I had dropped my comm for a moment there."

00:16:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, just that it's basically binoculars."

00:17:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Heh. Well, it's good to know! What's Stone's assessment now?"

00:18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's this anomaly detector? How does it work?"

00:22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not sure how to do this mission. I suppose it mean I need to fly through sector."

00:27:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh a puny mean felo, how cute."

00:29:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe I should tonic him."

00:29:18 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Tonic the puny evil!"

00:42:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Found a nest. No RATS probe object.."

00:42:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "... Scratch that last statement."

00:43:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll need to space walk for this?"

00:44:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Guess not."

00:44:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Enjoy GMG."

00:44:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Always."

00:45:06 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Don't let the restless spirits haunt you too much."

00:45:16 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Heh."

00:48:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If ti's an SVP thing, I don't know anything about it."

00:48:47 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

00:49:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was already overqualified when they started letting pilots do those."

00:49:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It appears as a blue blip on the starmaps. I tried salavaging it. And that worked."

00:57:58 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I can't recall, where does one find RATS antennas? I've fought a good number of RATS and none have come up with one that was salvagable.. any tips?"

00:58:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Johnath~n, I think for the antennas missi(n y% have to do a >est o# [ake their d@,tro< a[p-d missi\n too."

00:59:23 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah, that makes sense. Since none of their ships seem to have them."

00:59:43 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Those'll g#ve ya drills I-thin%-and definite{y co/es, but the antennas {__a g_ound thing."

01:00:15 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I haven't gotten many cores, either. Just must mean I am not that lucky."

01:00:18 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

01:00:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ju$t destroy all :;e rats you ca% find. You'll ~et cores as they blow up, b!t you're)right. It*ain't every single one'll give up their core."

01:00:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Also, sorry for the st.tic."

01:01:51 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I've destroy about.. 30 of them.. haven't seen any cores for a while now."

01:02:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm/ Yeah that is kinda crapp" luck."

01:02:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Werid, you're cehcking the hold, right?"

01:02:13 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."

01:02:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well damn."

01:02:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, does anyone know if a person still get spaid for aseroids, if they just ride in the ship and doesn't do any of the work."

01:02:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I;ve had #hat happen f]re. Just kinda g{t bad ,uck with it fr)m t.me :o time. But sinc, yo) can only turn{i$<so man& _ d@y."

01:03:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Th/y do not El!-"

01:03:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've )one roid[#aulin <ith 3 folks on a/ship. %nly the two t<at actually roped th' roid got p&id."

01:03:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good to know."

01:03:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "{ep."

01:03:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So it's ok for me to say, ride along then."

01:03:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Su)e."

01:04:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just k^ow it'll get pr?tty cramped ^n that control room."

01:04:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

01:10:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So I got a response from the revo tech about the patrol scanners."

01:10:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What did they tell you, Jacob?"

01:10:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What did they say? I got a response from Accord, as well."

01:12:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "What the tech told me is probably the same as what they told you. They're standard kit for patroling planets. They can do some very basic material ID stuff, but nothing more than that. They're entirely non-suspicious and aside from the material ID, they're just your standard electronic binoculars."

01:12:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, that roughly what they told me too."

01:13:18 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:13:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:13:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That pretty much clears a lot of that up then. We can probably conclude that best isn't using these to have people thrown in jail."

01:13:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He still using it to find people who oppose him, though."

01:14:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's true. Which is worry."

01:14:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Er.. worrying in and of itslf."

01:14:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Itself. Stupid comm."

01:15:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Either way, it's a fear tactic to have battlesuits stalking the streets."

01:15:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When he could just like, open a discussion with folks instead."

01:15:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Agreed."

01:16:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Which is why I don't think I'll be doing that again. The last thing I want to do is scare someone."

01:16:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Now I just need to get my battle."

01:16:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Er battlesuit."

01:16:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, I'm not or beheading folks, but we don't even know if that was those people. Those folks you saw in cul de sac were probably pretty scared to see a battlesuit to walk up on them."

01:17:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er not for beheading folks."

01:17:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, probably. Poor folks. In any case I couldn't have fired on them even if I'd wanted to."

01:18:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, were your weapons disabled for the mission?"

01:18:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's at least good news."

01:18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or.. do you jus tmean because they were too small to target."

01:18:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So far as I know, people in battlesuits can't fire on people in general. I don't think you can even fire on each other."

01:19:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can fire on each other."

01:19:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh. Well then you can't fire on people who aren't in suits then, I guess."

01:19:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And for good reason. We don't need any deaths."

01:19:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We've actually had to blow up people's suits when they've passed out."

01:19:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's not good."

01:19:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Also, my battle."

01:20:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Erm, my battlesuit is at Endymion."

01:20:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So I might see if I can have the tech at svp transfer it from there. Or is that."

01:20:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Mine's at SVP."

01:20:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Is that even possible? My comm hates me today."

01:21:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What? Have your suit at SVP? Yes. There is an entire station there for it."

01:21:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "No no. That's not what I meant."

01:22:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Then I missed what you meant..."

01:22:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I meant is it possible for the tech to transfer it from Endymion to svp?"

01:22:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No."

01:22:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was going to say, could ask."

01:22:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ask a SVP."

01:22:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That's what I'm about to do now."

01:22:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh they might, yeah."

01:23:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sorry, I always forget about the SVP guys."

01:23:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, and they do that shit for free."

01:23:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm pretty sure they'll transfer it from just about anywhere."

01:23:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Awesome."

01:23:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But it's been forever since I've been to SVP so don't quote me."

01:23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'll just keep it there then unless I wanna do some lpd missions."

01:24:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yep, he totally did it. That guy loves his job way too much."

01:25:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, he does. Can't blame him though."

01:25:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awesome."

01:27:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Well hell. I can see why ships have a safety override for artificial gravity. I just turned mine off for a bit, just for the hell of it. That's one of the strangest things ever. Floating around your own ship."

01:28:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:28:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

01:28:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It's a great way to save power though if that becomes necessary."

01:28:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Now I just need to find a chair with safety restraints installed. The one I have doesn't have them. Sad."

01:28:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And wow. Does artgrav really suck up that much juice?"

01:29:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes, it does."

01:29:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Depends on the size of the ship and all."

01:29:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, true."

01:29:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So, jacob. Where was this patrol mission? I can't remember.."

01:30:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But man does it feel strange to float around in your ship. What'd happen if those systems failed on a beacon drop?"

01:30:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "They can be found on new earth in the security office. But like I said before, I wouldn't try them out even though you do get a decent payout for them."

01:31:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, it might be a bit more difficult to mash buttons very acurately and quickly during combat if one is floating around the ship."

01:31:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Right?"

01:32:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Not to mention that some of the control boards might start flopping around and hit someone in the face."

01:32:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I can just see it now. Gunners would have to tell the pilot, I would have fired the lasers but I floated too far away."

01:32:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Well! My battlesuit is fully operational. Time to test it out."

01:32:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Johnathan, I suggest doing the low-priority missions instead."

01:33:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello everybody."

01:33:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I would be careful getting saftey restraints installed. Those are illegal. You can die, or be seriously injured if your escape pod engages and you are strapped in."

01:33:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I can definitely show you where they can be found. I need to do a couple myself at some point."

01:33:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Lily."

01:33:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ugh. That sucks."

01:33:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "And hi lily."

01:33:40 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi love."

01:33:52 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Handsome!"

01:34:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey and hows everything out there?"

01:34:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh, not too bad."

01:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We're still alive, so I figure that means things are going fairly well."

01:35:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Indeed."

01:36:41 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How's life?"

01:36:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Alive."

01:36:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Generally I mean."

01:36:56 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Better than death."

01:37:00 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

01:37:09 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "We can't judge a thing till we try it."

01:37:17 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Also that came out a lot worse than it sounded in my head sorry."

01:37:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "Hey, if you wanna try it, that's your business."

01:38:09 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:38:09 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:38:11 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sure. I'll write you all a review and mail it to you. I wonder how much postage stamps cost in the land of the dead."

01:38:11 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:38:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I wouldn't know and don't wanna find out."

01:38:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:38:33 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'll include it in my review."

01:38:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:38:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:38:40 [General Communication] Morris Corlew chuckles. "Ok."

01:38:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:38:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:39:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I sure hope others out there amongst AEU and visitors to AEU are ok."

01:39:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Also lily, we found out some very interesting stuff about those patrol missions and the scanners as well. Eli, could you kind of rehash the main points?"

01:40:42 Which sector did you mean?

01:40:42 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

01:40:43 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:40:44 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:40:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:40:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:40:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:40:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:40:51 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:40:51 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:40:52 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:40:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:40:55 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:40:56 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:40:59 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:41:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:41:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh yeah, what did you guys find out about the patrol scanners?"

01:41:50 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:41:50 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:41:55 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:41:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:42:05 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:42:09 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:42:09 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:42:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

01:42:10 You can go out and enter into the ship.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:42:11 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

01:42:11 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

01:42:13 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:42:13 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:42:14 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:42:14 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.

01:42:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The scanners are basically just electronic binoculars. They can identify certain materials but that's abou tit. The guy said it was pretty standard gear for doing a planetary patrol."

01:42:18 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

01:42:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

01:42:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

01:42:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Heh I was about to hunt you down!"

01:42:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

01:42:37 You laugh.

01:42:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

01:42:41 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:42:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:42:46 You say, "I was just in the flare."

01:42:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok checking fish tanks and felo ships and I'll be back."

01:43:01 You say, "Ok."

01:43:03 You grin.

01:43:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

01:43:06 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:43:09 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Beacons?"

01:43:09 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

01:43:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

01:43:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I don't even think he said certain material, eli. Just that they had some basic ID capabilities. So they could probably ID a flour or tree or rock or something, and probably people as well, but I doubt they could do specific ID on a person as far as that goes."

01:43:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

01:44:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

01:44:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Be right back."

01:44:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

01:44:09 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:44:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not sure they could even id a flower or a rock, I think they can probably just tell like, if something is made of plasteel or whatever."

01:44:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Maybe it was an experimental device?"

01:44:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yeah, true."

01:44:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But yeah, he said mostly they are just electronic binoculars."

01:45:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So it could ID simple compounds."

01:45:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok."

01:46:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But the way in which best is using them is more than a little unsettling."

01:46:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "That's interesting, but it still puts us on the streets though."

01:46:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Us, the way he's trying to use us."

01:46:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Exactly."

01:46:48 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

01:47:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes we're not the police. Each Planet and other inhabitated bodies should engage their own law enforcement. We were not trained to do this sort of work."

01:47:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd still like to know why he just doesn't have the military do this stuff. They know more about it than we do, generally speaking."

01:47:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm not even sure the military is the best. Plice yes, but military?"

01:48:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well the military too if it requires this sort of force but we're also not the military at all."

01:48:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Police that is."

01:48:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, they certainly didn't cover patrolling the streets in pilot school."

01:48:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I never even learned how to shoot a gun. That's not me."

01:49:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Neither did I, come to think about it. Did they even cover basic self-defense?"

01:49:48 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:50:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes I can gun against alien starships and in a battlesuit but not against humanity."

01:50:05 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What's everyone up to?"

01:50:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What're you saying? Yeah, we're not the military. But, we do have combat training in many aspects. Ground Combat, Space Combat... use common sense, and that's all we need, for any situation."

01:50:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, we can get stun guns, but that's about as deadly gun we can get."

01:50:21 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "GMG."

01:50:26 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Grabbing upgrades for a ship."

01:50:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No it's not this is gunning at other humanity."

01:50:41 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "One of those sounds a lot more fun than the other."

01:50:52 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah. I love this ship. It's exciting."

01:51:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ship upgrades are not as fun as usin 'em the first time."

01:51:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That's true."

01:51:19 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "So true."

01:51:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have to say it, I'm with lily on this one. What they're having us do would be similar to what a foot soldier in an army would do if he was in a battle. Either that or an MPO (military police officer)."

01:51:49 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But it's an awesome feeling when you finally get the points for something, and you're just super excited to get it."

01:52:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly."

01:52:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Whatcha upgradin?"

01:52:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I mean, I know how to use the suit against say, a tank, but not a person. Especialy when we're not even at war."

01:53:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Exactly. And I wouldn't feel comfortable using the suit against a human anyway."

01:53:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A cruiser class muffin ship."

01:53:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My platform. It's been a gradual work in progress. I got the hull early, and have gradually upgraded as I could. Like a little project."

01:53:54 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ah."

01:54:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Maybe that's what he was reling on. Where militiary might get a little... trigger happy. Where We won't when it comes to another human life."

01:54:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "A cruiser-class muffin ship with gingerbread turrets."

01:54:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, that just speculation. And playing at a guessing game."

01:54:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No idea. I'm not sure what his game is on this one."

01:54:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Other than intimidating battlesuits walking the streets."

01:55:02 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Damn it. Now I'm hungry."

01:55:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And exploiting us to do his dirty work."

01:55:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I saw an exploration ship once."

01:55:31 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

01:55:45 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:55:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is it exploiting, if we volenteer and are paid really, really well? That makes us just hired mercenaries."

01:56:14 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Only once?"

01:56:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Again, that's not our job and has never been. I did't sign-on for this type of work."

01:56:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I did not that is."

01:56:40 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Once was enough."

01:56:55 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Seeing it means you're not in it."

01:57:04 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "If you're not in it you're not exploring."

01:57:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That's cool. Just curious, why did you become a pilot?"

01:57:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So...you:close your eyes while you're inside?"

01:57:13 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not true. He'd have seen it before he got in it maybe."

01:57:26 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I don't see it when I'm inside of it. I see the inside of it."

01:57:30 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm sleepy."

01:57:38 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But that's it Erik. The inside is still it."

01:57:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

01:59:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Because, it's where all of the hot women are."

02:00:09 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:00:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

02:00:18 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:00:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:00:21 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:00:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:00:25 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:00:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I missed much of what they said is the experience in those missions."

02:00:51 Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

02:00:54 You say to Lily, "And you're the prettiest of them all."

02:00:54 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.

02:01:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Aww."

02:01:29 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.

02:01:35 You say, "They didn't really talk about what happened in the mission. Just that thescanners are just basically eletronic binoculars."

02:01:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."

02:02:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I wonder though if we're expected to engage anything we see though."

02:02:22 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Alright, rough draft of the storyboard written up."

02:02:25 You say, "I have no idea."

02:02:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I want to go check the office to see if I got any sort of report. Also would be interesting if I am able to observe those missions."

02:02:48 You say, "Ok."

02:02:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

02:02:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:02:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:02:55 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:03:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:03:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:03:06 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:03:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:03:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:03:20 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:03:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:03:25 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:03:25 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:03:26 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:03:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:03:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:03:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:03:33 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:03:33 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:03:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:03:35 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

02:03:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:03:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:03:39 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:03:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:03:42 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

02:03:43 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:03:43 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:03:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:03:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:03:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:04:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

02:04:01 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:04:03 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:04:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Be back in a couple."

02:04:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:04:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:04:19 "Li[ps," hmm?  Well, better luck next time.

02:04:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:04:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

02:04:27 I don't see that here.

02:04:28 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:04:30 I don't see "lily" here.

02:05:45 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins taps his claws on the floor.

02:06:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope, no mission reports except someone lost their battlesuit and I'm not going to point out destroyed battlesuits until we are back to work if and when that occurs."

02:07:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just be careful and don't get hurt!"

02:07:39 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:07:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

02:07:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:07:52 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:07:58 You ask, "So, did you get a report?"

02:08:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:08:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey, lily. I've gotten my battlesuit fully working into an operational status... if the need were to arise that I would actually need to use it."

02:08:18 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:08:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:08:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily cheer for Johnathon

02:08:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, that's intersting. You say there's no report of a completed mission?"

02:08:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:08:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope."

02:08:48 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

02:09:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wonder if it means these aren't being reported through official channels."

02:10:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So did anyone earn credits for going out there?"

02:10:48 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:10:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I did manage to complete that one patrol mission I got yesterday. Got 5 mill."

02:11:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:11:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah interesting."

02:11:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "No wait, it wasn't yesterday. It was a couple days ago."

02:11:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Jacob, where is that launched from?"

02:11:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "The patrol missions? Or the low-priority missions?"

02:11:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Thought it was yesterday? Wasn't yesterday the first time the guy was out there?"

02:11:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The patrol missions."

02:12:08 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:12:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:12:13 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:12:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:12:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That wasn't yesterday?"

02:12:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I think I mentioned earlier that they were in the security center on new earth. Talk to the military officer, but I'd still."

02:12:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh right, it's not. Yeah."

02:12:46 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

02:12:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'd still suggest doing the lpd missions."

02:13:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is the Security center?"

02:13:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:13:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah do the Space Vermin and Low Deployment ones."

02:13:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "It's just past the bridge to the spaceport. You can't miss it if you look for it."

02:13:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I need to hit a nest to complete all the alloted SVP missions for now."

02:13:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:13:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So Jacob did you just deploy from the security Office or where did you launch out of?"

02:14:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Well there's a sort of hidden door that you have to go through and you enter into this little."

02:14:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Er.. ramshackle deployment area."

02:14:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "L."

02:14:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:20:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah ok. Was just curious since the guy asks if you need a new one. Was wondering if it could get smashed or something."

02:21:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:21:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Interesting yeah I had to set the one up in my suit but I've not even engaged in a mission so far."

02:22:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey sighs. "Everytime I walk away, I get another mail message."

02:22:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Popular guy. Must be all the ladies."

02:22:17 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "This mail is cool though!"

04:06:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops forgot we're still on New Earth and I'm too lazy to go back to the torus this morning."

04:06:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "How long do you guys think this strike will last for?"

04:06:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

04:06:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Until Outccord is dead!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Honestly, I don't see an end in sight."

04:06:28 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "That's fine."

04:07:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

04:07:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

04:07:15 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:07:32 Lily says to you, "I love you."

04:08:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I put four really nice souldiers into the bigger ship. I was curious if they had multiplied. I even put the big silver one in there. It would be awesome if he reproduces silver ones."

04:09:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think he looked like Xavier."

04:09:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I put the silver one, a red one, a white one and an Octarine one in there."

04:10:23 You say to Lily, "I love you too."

04:10:39 You grin. "That'd be awesome."

04:10:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I'd love a ship full of all Silver soldiers."

04:11:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

04:11:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Aww."

04:11:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He and Shasta were so special."

04:11:48 You nod and smile.

04:11:52 You say, "They were."

04:12:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I so appreciate your sharing them with me."

04:12:18 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "No problem."

04:12:50 You say, "I appreciated you letting them run around your ship."

04:12:53 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:12:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Oh they were so fun!"

04:13:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "In some odd way too, I felt they were our personal sentries."

04:13:25 You grin.

04:13:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Although I doubt they would have hurt a fly."

04:13:37 You say, "Well, both sure liked to hang out in the airlock."

04:13:40 You grin.

04:13:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep they did."

04:13:49 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Hey Aisling."

04:14:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling!"

04:14:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling!"

04:14:01 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Aisling!"

04:14:15 [General Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "Aisling!"

04:14:29 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Whoops."

04:14:40 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:14:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

04:15:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh sadly, a couple of the pets may grow old soon. I am terrible anymore with keeping track of when I found certain pets. I am trying to remember when I got Prissy and Mischief."

04:16:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Shine is only a couple of months old and Cheri-Pye not a lot older though."

04:17:37 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:18:18 You say, "Yeah, I don't remember when you got Prissy and mischief."

04:20:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone ever seen a pet felo suddenly run in fear to another room?"

04:21:05 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only when I enter the room they're in."

04:21:23 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa assaults your ears with a burst of static and screeching feedback as he transmits at the top of his lungs, "HAR, HAR HAR HAR, HAAAAAAAAAR!"

04:21:37 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Why."

04:21:46 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I...don't know."

04:21:58 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I mean, I never fed a felo to a tardick lizard before. Who would do such a thing?"

04:21:58 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ow for fucks sake. And yes I've seen them run, but mostly if they're hungry."

04:22:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This was specifically in fear, you could tell the way it reacted that it was afraid of something."

04:22:42 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'd have to see the felo in question."

04:22:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's possible it was the sanitation drone, but I've never seen them react that way before."

04:22:53 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Did it see a shadow of something flicker?"

04:23:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Could be...but why would it run from a drone? If it's near a drone, ain't it on a leash?"

04:23:14 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'll bring the ouija board."

04:23:17 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, sanitation drones use to dispose of felo rather efficiently once upon a tie. Ghty ecould have developed an instinctive inbred fear."

04:23:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's on a leash, it still took off,  Constantine had to go get it."

04:23:23 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Was it Sir Goldenpants by any chance?"

04:23:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "No, not one of mine."

04:23:46 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Was it a telepath?"

04:23:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't think so."

04:23:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. Dunno."

04:23:58 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Was it vanta?"

04:24:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

04:24:11 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've never seen one react to drones and buncha mine've been around drones a good bit."

04:24:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe it's an old drone that didn't get reprogrammed? I didn't notice it try to grab the felo though."

04:24:40 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "He did not come from a mind reader line. He came straight up from a line of feathered felo. So I don't think that could be it, even in his genes."

04:24:44 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "My vote is still for ghosts."

04:24:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

04:25:00 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think it doesn't make a difference if the drone was reprogrammed or not. The felo may have developed an instinctive genetic fear for it."

04:25:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

04:25:11 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:25:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't say that Tanny.. We were talking about a dead person right before this happened."

04:25:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe t)at's it th>n Eli."

04:25:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm with Ather on this one. It wouldn't surprise me in the least. I mean if it were me...I'd run like fuck."

04:25:27 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Oh oh oh."

04:26:10 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I've totally got a ouija board somewhere in my stuff. Let's experiment!"

04:26:18 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the smooth skin above her breasts.

04:28:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that makes sense Ather, I've just never seen them react that way to drones before."

04:28:34 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "What are you all talking about?"

04:28:44 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli's felo peed itself."

04:28:55 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Or whoever the fuck's felo it was."

04:29:09 [General Communication] Damien Goss transmits, "Oh, ok."

04:29:16 [General Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "Thanks for the heads up."

04:29:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "As much as we've had felo round drones...it's odd that the behavior's just showin up."

04:30:02 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Random genetic mutation, maybe."

04:30:08 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Happens."

04:30:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Could be. But you'd think a behavior like that woulda gone extinct instead of poppin up strong suddenly."

04:30:25 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident softly on the neck.

04:30:33 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Where are y'all anyways?"

04:30:39 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ghost central."

04:30:47 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Sweet."

04:31:21 [General Communication] Morris Corlew whistles.

04:31:27 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm hangin' in the new earth lounge."

04:31:31 Your communicator reports that...

04:31:31

04:31:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're in the center of Jacktown."

04:31:50 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why."

04:32:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Been walking around, tryign to find out what the word on the street is."

04:32:14 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "They already hate Best. We ened to find other places that don't hate best."

04:37:37 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "The battle of the lounges."

04:37:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Apparently."

04:37:51 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I battle no one. I just want turnovers."

04:38:07 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Woo! Turnovers!"

04:38:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh you must have general on."

04:38:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And tied."

04:38:36 You say, "I do."

04:38:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "You are a brave soul!"

04:38:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

04:38:41 You laugh.

04:38:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

04:38:50 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

04:38:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or more like tolerant."

04:38:58 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:39:00 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

04:39:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm pretty intolerant to what goes on on that channel."

04:39:40 You say, "That's understandable."

04:40:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do enjoy being social and it's been frustrating that the bull shitters control things there. But you can see how I like to interact with our own pilots and I so enjoy the new ones we've been fortunate to recruit lately."

04:40:58 You nod and smile.

04:41:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

04:41:13 You say, "Yeah, I don't mind socializing."

04:41:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd take any of them into SEAS."

04:41:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Initially I had my reservations about Johnathon but he's ok."

04:42:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just a little odd heh but I'm glad he speaks what he thinks."

04:42:07 You say, "Yeah, from what I've seen, he seems ok."

04:47:14 You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.

04:51:48 Lily gently rubs your back and strokes your hair.

04:52:24 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:52:51 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

04:53:06 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But what if we don't want to try?"

04:53:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

04:53:38 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:56:02 Shule kisses your neck and over your chest.

05:49:51 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.

05:53:51 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

05:56:52 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

05:57:57 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The activity is the Patriots turning the Union into their private kingdom, bit y bit. That's the only activity."

06:02:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is there a good way to make some good creds, working for the Accord?"

06:04:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "SVP missions and they also offer salvage and combat missions. Though you can't do the combat missions alone. I'm not sure what kind of requirements must be met before you can do the salvage ones,  either."

06:04:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But salvage missions pay like 20 mil a pop. You probably need a medium transport and a decent grapple first."

06:05:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We tried allowing those for the strike, but they still translate to alliance gain so it caused some problems."

06:05:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah. But, we're on strike right?"

06:07:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I can't do beacons yet. Can't afford the launchers just yet."

06:07:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

06:07:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And, I'm still a cadet..."

06:15:20 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "AEU."

06:15:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...in my book, "alleged separatists" kinda says it all."

06:23:22 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So is that you or Ather?"

06:23:38 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Welcome to the corps Senora Evenita Kallseneti!"

06:23:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Huh?"

06:24:14 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "He's giving me crap. Shut it, Johann."

06:24:26 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh. Feel free to continue."

06:24:34 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah chortles.

06:24:40 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I better not, she might garrote me."

06:41:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Interesting, I guess that's what I get fo trying to tell them that they wanted us to use battlesuits."

06:41:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's that?"

06:41:47 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, like I was tellin Tanny...there wasn't an untruth I saw in that...and they did call attention to the fact that these acts were perpetrated by 'alleged separatists.' All in all, I don't think it was too bad."

06:42:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's true, it did say alleged, I guess that means we're not the only ones suspicious of that."

06:42:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep. That's what I was thinkin."

06:43:03 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "At the very least, it means they aren't sure."

06:43:09 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

06:43:53 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wish they would just say Rogue pilot though, I'm nowhere near the only one who is having problems with this, the whole corps is."

06:44:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. I wish they wouldn't say rogue pilot, I mean."

06:44:12 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't you the one that contacted 'em?"

06:44:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, but I made it clear in my letter that it was all of us, or at least most of us."

06:45:04 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess they have to take that at face value though, since it's a letter coming from just me."

06:45:44 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, but if they get a letter from somebody known to be a Rogue...they probably think...and maybe rightly so, that it'll sell more issues if they mention the source where they got the info. It sensationalizes it. Wanna get way from that? have somebody that ain't a rogue write to 'em."

06:46:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, we've done that a couple of times and it just didn't get published."

06:46:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably for the same reason that you just said."

06:46:22 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well...kinda a catch-22 then."

06:47:16 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I hate that there's folks out there that must think i'm a really terrible guy. At least you folks know the truth."

06:47:52 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "A wise person once said to me Eli, it ain't what others think bout ya...it's what ya know bout yourself."

06:48:41 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "What others think about you is pretty important."

06:48:53 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It can get rocks thrown at your head."

06:49:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Unfortunately that's true."

06:50:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Eli, you're the worst. How dare you think of helping innocent people stranded in the middle of the galaxy!"

06:57:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone know any good meatloaf recipes?"

06:57:52 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

06:58:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd have to write my folks, but could probably get ya one. My ma used to make some amazin meatloaf and mashed taters."

06:58:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Awesome."

06:59:06 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Might take a few days. Was gonna call home later today though if you can wait till tonight."

06:59:16 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heard some folks talking about meatloaf recipes while I was talkin to folks today. Kinda got me craving a good meatloaf."

06:59:24 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I bet the Gunarsh people make good meatloaf, they love food of that sort."

06:59:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Food of that sort? You mean a loaf of meat?"

07:00:12 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "The sort of meals Morris described, including meatloaf."

07:00:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They like loaf based nutrition?"

07:00:20 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, right on."

07:01:06 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn Nicolette, why'd you have to tell me that. Now I just wanna go to Gunarsh even more."

07:01:32 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Go for the magic space god, stay for the loaf of meat."

07:11:52 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.

07:27:52 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.

You can go south and out.

12:20:50 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:20:50 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:20:51 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:20:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

12:20:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:21:04 The ship is already moving.

12:21:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:21:14 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:21:16 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:21:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:21:17 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:07:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Hello."

19:11:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Is it safe to do a RATS Pod alone?"

19:15:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Most certainly."

19:15:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Nice."

19:15:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Just go slow and watch your damage."

19:15:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I can get two missions done for the price of one."

19:15:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nice!"

19:16:28 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

19:18:13 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

19:18:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

19:18:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

19:24:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Do you use the space grade detenators on the RATS pods?"

19:25:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can."

19:25:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're grenades, basically."

19:25:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "RATs pods usually only pit you against one rat at a time, so they're not as necessary."

19:26:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That said, you're not really paid to bring home detonators."

19:26:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So go nuts."

19:26:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or at least try them."

19:26:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I actually found the detonator in a practice mission."

19:26:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

19:27:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, RATs will drop them from time to time."

19:27:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Sweet."

19:27:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When you go on real nests there are times when you don't want to be hitting enemies willy nilly."

19:27:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And want to focus on one."

19:27:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you usually won't want to go nuts with grenades unless the league suit tells you to."

19:38:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

19:49:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

20:04:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

20:32:02 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

20:34:51 You say to Lily, "I love you."

20:35:47 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

20:36:51 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:04:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

21:14:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Is SVP the only mission depot?"

21:19:01 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Anybody out at 285, I'm gettin the stuff for the accelerator and watchtower together now. If ya need to land, land on the roid station. I overslept, my apologies."

21:24:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah yawns. "Snag a charger if you need it too."

21:25:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Got the charger. I'm lookin for batteries at the moment."

21:25:55 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We got those as well. Go ahead if you want."

21:27:17 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I saw some from you and Johann...maybe one by Libs. Anyway, still lookin."

21:28:07 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah. The ones that are just contributed by us are there for whatever. We don't care what they're used for."

21:31:36 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I think I'm gonna go for red streaks this time."

21:33:09 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs. "Morning Mel."

21:33:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:33:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes but also talk to the Liaison Officer in the offic on New earth if you haven't already."

21:33:22 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hey."

21:33:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

21:33:32 Lily says to you, "I love you."

21:33:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "It doesn't look like he has new jobs for me at the moment."

21:35:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:35:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah ok then SVP is about it and you can do 5 of those per day. You can also do Mail deliveries, go to the Unreality Programming office and apply for employment there to do courier work and other work is around."

21:43:59 You say to Lily, "I love you too."

21:44:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:45:21 [General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew transmits, "This'll take a bit."

21:50:17 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Hmmm... flame red, neon red, or neon orange streaks."

21:50:26 [General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew transmits, "Flame red."

21:50:35 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Definitely flame red."

21:50:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Bubblegum pink."

21:50:42 [General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew transmits, "Wait though...is that with your phosphorescent octarine?"

21:50:43 [General Communication] Maya Hyru transmits, "Neon orange!"

21:50:51 [General Communication] Morris 'The Moose' Corlew laughs. "Woo Eli."

21:52:35 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

21:53:18 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yes it's with the octarine."

21:53:37 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "How bout somethin metallic?"

21:53:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Gold maybe."

21:53:49 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Indigo."

21:53:51 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I did gold last time."

21:53:57 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Silver?"

21:54:14 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Everything indigo. Indigo is the best."

21:55:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

21:55:46 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I want something fiery. Hmm, do they have bronze..."

21:55:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That might be good."

21:58:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Who have the peacekeeper ships?"

22:00:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:00:10 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Have a safe trip space bus driver."

22:00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Accord comand does."

22:00:27 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Or something."

22:00:39 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or something?"

22:00:59 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Indeed. Or something."

22:03:24 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Also ice cream. Just saying."

22:03:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ice cream is a thing."

22:04:06 [General Communication] Jacob laughs. it is a thing. and it does stuff. with things.

22:04:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

22:04:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Folks are losin it left and right, I swear."

22:04:31 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh dear."

22:04:48 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Perhaps they already lost it, you're just noticing."

22:04:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Pizzert?"

22:04:54 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'd quote Mel, if I could properly remember her line. But that."

22:05:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "This is a distinct possibility Michael."

22:05:06 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Alright, now that my hair's sorted. What's everyone up to?"

22:05:26 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm currently sitting in my cargo hauler. And I'm existing."

22:09:34 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm sitting in a tactical platform, but it's not mine."

22:10:32 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Fun times. I wish I had enough to get an air fort."

22:14:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've got a fever, and the only cure is leafy orange plant."

22:14:25 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

22:14:35 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It's confirmed. The corps is going nuts."

22:14:58 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Going nuts, evenia? I think we went nuts a long time ago."

22:15:25 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No no...we've always been a li'l strange. but lately...we've gone from strange. to some other level even I don't have a name for."

22:15:41 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Bizarre."

22:16:08 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "It's all me."

22:41:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hey folk of the AEU. How are things going?"

22:41:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Not too bad over here."

22:41:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Pretty good, you?"

22:44:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, not too bad. A little board, honestly... with the strike on and all. Been doing minimal things.. in support for the strike."

22:45:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Believe me I don't like it anymore than the next pilot. I haven't worked for a couple days honestly. Even though I should probably do so if I want to get this asteroid hauler I'm looking at."

22:46:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I call minimal work, using a flitter for doing all the work one does."

22:46:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

22:46:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields laughs.

22:46:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Funnily enough, I've been doing well with a cargo hauler."

22:47:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I have the cargo hauler, a fighter and a flitter."

22:47:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I wonder how much a passenger hauler is."

22:47:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "The flitter and fighter I have set up to use chainguns and torps. The cargo hauler I have set up for lasers."

22:47:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I really should've got a cargo hauler. But, it doesn't have the weapons that the flitter has.. but, it's a trade up."

22:47:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "About a mill for the starter ship. They can be found on landfall."

22:48:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Starter ship?"

22:48:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "For passenger transporting."

22:49:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oooh. Yeah, I won't be doing passenger transporting till after this strike is over. Nor curior services, either."

22:49:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "How long until that is?"

22:50:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I haven't even applied to reality programming. Just doesn't seem like my cup of tea."

22:50:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "As for how long the strike will last, your guess is as good as mine."

22:50:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I prefer the military and salvaging."

22:50:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Combat, definately... got to keep Humanity safe. Minimal salvaging.. just to cover any unexpected costs that arise. That's about it.."

22:50:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Salvaging doesn't get you a lot of credits. Not by a long shot."

22:51:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Yeah. Gotta get 20000 EOS to pay off my Tesla loan."

22:52:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, I don't know about that. The debris I've been finding pays well enough. If I had a...say.. a light transport, my time would be effectively put to good use."

22:53:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "And finding RATS cores is an amazing way to get money."

22:53:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yes, yes it is."

22:53:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Pocket change."

22:53:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

22:53:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I turned in something like 5 or 6 once and got a few mill for them."

22:53:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Accept I must have reached today's limit, as the ship is not getting anymore."

22:54:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am half tempted to actually rent a fighter and drop a beacon."

22:55:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The problem I have is... where do I drop said beacon."

22:55:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I would do that, but meh. Not the best at flying. Not fun."

22:55:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a battle scanner one sector west of the torus."

22:55:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Do I drop it a sector away from New Earth..."

22:55:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, don't do that."

22:55:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs laughs.

22:55:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "That would not be good for us."

22:55:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do it within a sector or two of the battle scanner."

22:57:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah, I understand that. Greatly... I, in most part, say it in response to a conversation I had the other day... specific individuals "believing" Outsiders aren't "a threat to humanity" anymore.."

22:57:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Tell that to my dead brother."

22:57:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where is the battle scanner?"

22:57:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I don't think launching near New Earth would be a problem in that regard. The patrols are relatively small and would probably fly away rather than attacking the planet."

22:58:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, according to our president, unregs and pirates are a much bigger threat than Outsiders."

22:58:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The navy would deal with them in short order if they did. The payout is just better by the battle scanner."

22:58:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's one sector west of the torus."

22:58:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:58:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Only the worst administration under Best makes that sort of claim. This is certainly not the opinion held by the majority of pilots."

22:59:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Thanks."

22:59:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The only place you absolutely don't want to launch them in in mutuality space."

22:59:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Gives me an excuse to hop in the fighter."

22:59:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys have any simulator time?"

23:00:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Simulator time? What's a... similator?"

23:00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a combat simulator at accord command. It's not strictly necessary, but it might be good to run through once before facing outsiders."

23:00:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Especially if you haven't done any manual flying in combat yet."

23:00:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs laughs.

23:01:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah... I've had a lot of practice manual flying. I used RATS to simulate actual combat."

23:02:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, cool."

23:02:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "They're honestly boring."

23:02:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In general RATs are a pretty poor substitute for outsiders, since they don't lock on you for evasion practice."

23:02:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unless they're heavy fighters or reapers."

23:03:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But low strength beacons aren't very dangerous."

23:03:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll be fine."

23:03:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There really is no reason for you all to caution anyone about launching decoy beacons west of New Earth. The computer system would block that request. You can only launch decoy beacons in gamma sectors and lower seacurity."

23:03:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If I am running into heavy fighters or reapers for Outsiders.. I am in the wrong ship, dropping the wrong becon...maybe?"

23:03:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. Like I said, no reason to do that when the scanner is available. It's not a security concern."

23:04:19 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

23:04:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I mean any RATs besides heavy fighters and reapers aren't good manual flying practice."

23:04:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Since there are no locks to evade."

23:04:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Outsider weapons don't work the way RATs drills do."

23:05:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, Constantine is right. I can help you learn how to fly if you'd like."

23:05:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eh, there isn't a single RATS-CLASS starship that will be a test of anyone's flying skills unless they're especially incompetent."

23:05:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is true."

23:05:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

23:05:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Meh. I just go by the RAT, lack on, and blow it up."

23:06:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's the difference between dealing with a pack of wild dogs and facing a group of skilled fighters."

23:06:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "RATs just come up on you and eat your ship."

23:06:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Right. You don't even need to take the ship off of autopilot."

23:08:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Very true, Ather. But, all the same, I found, flicking it into manual, then fly around a little is a little good practice. But, pretty boring."

23:09:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, if you feel comfortable, by all means give a beacon a shot."

23:09:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just be wary of chains, if you get in trouble you might not be able to escape easily."

23:10:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And if you're not going through the sim first, I would at least recommend doing the weakest beacon strength, so it's one-on-one."

23:10:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Chains... fun. Right. Uh.. what else can you tell me about the beacons, specifically?"

23:11:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I don't see the scanner."

23:11:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's not much to them. You fire them off, then wait for the patrol to show up. It can be several minutes. A lot of people like to wait near one end of the sector rather than in the middle. This won't matter for low strength beacons, but it's a good habit to get into for when you start doing higher ones, so that you don't get surrounded."

23:11:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Outsider thrall ships will attach a chain to you to limit your flying range around them."

23:11:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Where do you buy them?"

23:12:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Beacons that is."

23:12:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Beacons and beacon launchers are sold at Accord command."

23:12:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I couldn't afford a ship armed with what would be required to take on anything higher then the weakest beacon. Aside that, I don't have the points to warrent my bragging... Or test my stupidity..."

23:12:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

23:12:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "We could tag team one, Johnathon, I'd reckon."

23:12:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So, one thing about them."

23:13:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If any ship other than the ship that launches enters the sector, more enemies will show up."

23:13:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To reinforce the initial patrol."

23:13:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you can definitely do beacons in multiple fighters, and it's fun, but be aware of that."

23:13:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll be facing more enemies than usual."

23:13:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not sure what happens if multiple ships are present at the time the beacon is launched."

23:15:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "More ships definitely tend to show up."

23:16:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "One thing to be aware of is that in small ships without strong hull upgrades, a single hit will likely knock out a turret."

23:16:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you could potentially lose a lot of combat strength each time you get hit."

23:16:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Hmm. Can't get hull upgrades yet I don't think."

23:16:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Make sure you have torpedos."

23:16:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I have them."

23:17:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am a bit iffy on the rental fighter. I am not sure exactly it is equiped with."

23:17:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:17:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:17:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:17:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Mine has torpedoes and chain guns."

23:17:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It has intermediate upgrades and is pretty good."

23:18:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Lasers or chains?"

23:18:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I think lasers, but doon't quote me."

23:18:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:18:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:18:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

23:18:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:18:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:18:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:18:35 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:18:36 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

23:18:49 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:19:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I guess there is only one sure way of finding out what a rental is capable of.."

23:19:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Hmm. Tr Can you swap out the weapon?"

23:19:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:19:18 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

23:19:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Whoops."

23:19:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:19:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:19:38 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:19:39 You pull a large lever towards you.
