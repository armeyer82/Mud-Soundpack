Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black
plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go out.

Subject: hall of pain

We will be setting up a beacon at this field for some artifacting. Since nobody
wants to go far from home right now, this field is pretty close and we can get
home within a day and far less via capsule. If people are interested, join us.
If anybody wants to go down with myself or Morris to put up stations, yell.
You will travel to the end of the 270 beacon chain and then the field is
aproximately 162 light-years from there. It is south and very slightly down but
you may be able to hit it at 270 and 0. I wouldn't go more than -1 or -2 and pay
attention to your drift if you are not used to it. At about 142 to 144
light-years traveled, you should be able to find the artifact beacon and
autotravel from there.
Again, if people want a lift rather than dealing with the travel, give us a
yell. I will be labeling the beacon as 275 for convenience purposes.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Asteroid Belt Management Station.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Notice from Lily Kaise on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Greetings
SEAS! A group is going out to Hall of Pain Early next week. If interested,
please read the General Exploration Message Board. Shule and I don't have any
immediate plans to go at this time. When we were there last, neither of us
realized much value from the Artifacts and due to the unpleasant attitudes of
League pilots, we're not particularly comfortable with hanging out and
socializing with them at this time. It's a good place though for those with less
than a few thousand in Exploration to gain good income and Exploration
experience. If you want us for company, we would be willing to go out with you.
Otherwise, don't forego this opportunity if you are up for it. I know that if it
were worthwhile in other aspects, that Shule and I would attend. Fly safely and
fight hard on the ground! [14:35 25 January 2318 GST]
Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! Sometime as early as late
evening today or tomorrow and during the day over the weekend, I would like to
attempt to resume the process of cleansing the Old Frontier. Asteroid Processing
Station. Ather, shule and myself have acquired the new Testudinidae Battlesuit.
I have run the Testudinidae on Tesla quite a bit and it rocks! Tesla. I
certainly would like to promote that we work together to obtain this Battlesuit
for everyone who is interested in owning one. Leading in the Testudinidae
Battlesuit does pose some challenge which I believe, with a little teamwork,
that we can overcome. It does have an ability to attract the enemy, one can Stun
and it does incredible damage. It does not possess the traditional Light
Abilities which we are accustomed to utilizing on a League Battlesuit nor does
it obviously have the Light ability of Burn. So an AEU Battlesuit with Light can
use Burn as I have before without seeming to attract too much attention but if
battlesuits who can interrupt the enemy's ability to fire can be very helpful.
So let's do this and prove that we can manage without some other Alliance's
Battlesuit once again! When I'm ready to begin forming our team, I will call out
over the AEU Channel for participants. We'll meet in the New Earth Lounge and
proceed. Fly safely and fight hard on the ground! [15:10 25 January 2318 GST]

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling
bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red
aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling
ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice
Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid
security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.
