You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an old
engine casing.

Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar

Lileah Rose says, "a bit tedious or ifyou're feeling impatient, just transfer
wheever you want specific currency."
sal
You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an
asteroid containing rock-eating microbes.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an
abandoned storage pod.

Egil Aurstad
He appears to be 27 years old. He is about five feet and ten inches tall and has
freckled skin. His body is thin with plain hips and thin calves. He has sloping
shoulders and a narrow chest. His face is long and subtly asymmetrical, with a
pointed nose and sharp chin. His lips are flat and brownish red and occasionally
part to reveal a set of gapped teeth. Beneath a set of wild eyebrows, his eyes
are blue and widely-set. His short, wavy hair is blonde and neatly combed. He
has short clear fingernails.
 He is wearing a standard grey shipsuit and a pair of shiny black boots. He is
also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator,
a barely functional metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack, and a
black flightbag. His head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
He is carrying a copy of "Starships and Upgrades: Fringe Edition" in his right

The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that
the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship

[Starship "Second Chances"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Destroyers:
Three-Person Light Escort 15,000,000.00 (New Earth Blazing Trails)
AS-0A AEU LIGHT ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 50 industry points        15 combat points
Model number: AS-0A                     Designation: Light Escort
Turret hardpoints: 10                   Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The light Escort is the first destroyer that an AEU pilot will ever have access
to. It's a reasonably well armed vessel, with no major bonuses. However, it can
still pack quite a punch, especially with more advanced upgrades and its single
launcher.
Three-Person Heavy Defense Vessel 7,500,000.00 (Endymion)
AD-1N AEU HEAVY DEFENSE VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 100 industry points       250 combat points
Model number: AD-1N                     Designation: Heavy Defense Vessel
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 4
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The defense vessel is a very well armed vessel, holding 12 turrets. It does have
a major disadvantage though, which likely also explains the cheaper cost. That
disadvantage is that it has no FTL drive. However, it can still be a very useful
ship, but just know if you want to take it anywhere you'll need to dock it
inside a bigger ship, or tug it around using a tugboat.
Three-Person Clipper 200,000,000.00 (New Earth Allied Technologies)
AS-4F AEU CLIPPER-CLASS ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 750 industry points       750 combat points
Model number: AS-4F                     Designation: Clipper
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 14
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The Clipper is the most advanced destroyer that the AEU has. It's as armed as
the defense vessel with 12 turrets, but has the further advantage of a vastly
increased engine speed when it's going at maximum burn, and also has an extra
hull failsafe over the other two destroyers.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Correction, not the
pilot's dumb mistake anyways."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Yes, all balls
needed were dropped already during election thing. No balls are left."
[General Communication] Tara Flores snorts.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That must be quite a
painful problem."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Have the skims already
been cut off to us Pierre?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aisling?"
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Only one way to
find out."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, I'll go check
shortly."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "RATS nest three sectors east of
orion."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Six fighters guarding it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, now what am I
looking for Evenia?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would really be
disappointing."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That's normal Tara."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Life is very often
disappointing."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't I know it."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's putting it
mildly Constantine."

ejectors, but yeah."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, here's to hoping
we don't have to retreat into Mutuality space for any reason. Like from supposed
non-threat aliens."

[Starship "Kalliste"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

there a loooong time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "One hour and fourty
minutes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Now I've found
that I can only find a certain number of artifacts in a day before I just stop
seeing anything out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll have to
let me know what your experience is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I usually
get 1 artifact every 15 or so sectors until I have 22 or so, then I can go 1000
sectors and find nothing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why this would
be the case, I have no idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe stuff has
to drift back in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I found two on the way
out on my search, and four on the way back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Con."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Can the scout be
fitted with a rift drive?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's my next goal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anything with
a FTL drive can be fitted with one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's great out
in 777, because there's no slow flying back to the beacon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can just
rift back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Flying back from 777
right now would take like 10 minutes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I mean if
you were artifacting and flew 1000 sectors north."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You wouldn't
have to turn around and go back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You could just
rift back in 2-3 seconds."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ohhh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, at least this is
a pretty rift. Rainbow roads, clouds, and such. Makes me squint my eyes at all
the colours though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I carry some
sunglasses with,  just in case I run inot that one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im just hoping the
flow changes soon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "T&ere's a
rift forecaster you can get at some point that will help you know when that wil
happen."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Starting to lose

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Bed time for
Constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, I'm going
to work for a little bit, I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "He's been trying
for some time it looks like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You get that new
scout, Dak?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I was buying a
scout?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought
you said you were."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Nah. I got a hold
that's three times as large."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, I must have
dreamed it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I don't think
a scout would do me much good without jets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "My next purchase
will probably be a roid hauler anyways."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I was
thinking combat scout. I was going to see if you wanted to do a beacon in it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You need
a,bit more for that, don't you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, you
could get a regular scout then have it refitted."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow, yeah
it's 500/500."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What is the
refitted one like?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does it get any
guns in the control room?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's got
seven turrets. It's likke a discou>t combat scout. Not quite as good, but it's
decent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er it's
bascially a combat scout without the laser bonus, if I'm remembering correctly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "For some reason, I
think those security fighters are pretty neat. No jump drive, but neat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I used to
love those, for real."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't really
care for the grid issues that 6 turrets on a fighter gave me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Especially
since you get to use other alliances tech o; them. But also,  I'm from Hyperion
so it's like, Hyperion represent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We got any others
around from Hyperion, or is it just you and I?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh, I dropped
my communicator into my turnover."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Now it's
gonna be all gooey."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I might give the
fighters another try now that I have better grids."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Just do your best
to not mix the two up. I can survive without the sounds of a transmitter being
chewed on in my ear."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "As a note, how can
anyone stand to salvage in Orion? I hated it for the very brief moment I did
it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Because it'
sgot decent grade chunks?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It was probably
just bad luck, but I felt like everything I scanned was a roid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think people
tolerate it because it's the best you can get without rifting places."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just salvage
every chunk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Flying around
trying to figure out which ones are comets is too terrible until you have an
expert scanner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've yet to salvage
a roid that was worth my time, but maybe it's not so bad with a much larger
hold."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You culd
always expel iron and lead, that might make you like it a bit more?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or try 777?
It's got lots of decent shipwrecks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Iron and lead make
my soul bleed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll likely be able
to start working in 777 soon enough though. There's a few upgrades I want before
I head out there."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yo Evenia."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "What do you want with
mYes?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Remember when you were
talking about a place where you found 50 artifacts in one day?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I do."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where was that place?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "From b-24. You need
to go at a heading of 157.5. 7."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How will I know when I get
there?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It will show up on your
rift locations."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you know about how far
it is?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm going ot take a
wild guess here, and say about twenty lightyears? Evenia can correct me if I'm
wrong."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And what might it look
like on my rift location list?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's a ship
graveyward, it'll show up as like the remains of blah blah, or fall of the
Fringe 45th or something like that."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I can't remember the
exact distance. But it's an artifact field. Like the 777 field. Just a different
name."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, exactly."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome! Thanks, guys."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You're totally
welcome. Just please be careful if you're going to rift. Make sure you have rift
tools."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that was the last they
ever heard of Constantine."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Don't joke like that
when i; comes to the rift."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I have some tools
around here."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You know what kind of
tools she's talking about right? They hyperspanner and the zero-point energy
charger?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I have those."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't ever used them,
but I do have a set."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Make sure you keep
track of where you are going so you can find your way back, you won't be able to
auto-travel back."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figure I'll have
to keep careful track of how many sectors I move, retrace my steps, and then
make sure I use the reverse heading from that same sector, right?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is going to be
337.5, -7, right? It works like a circle like that?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Clearly I am ready for
this journey."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sure you
wouldn't rather have someone go with you? I mean I did it the way you are
talking, but I'm also a little crazy."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But this could
be an adventure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what I
would have said. I won't say another word. Good luck and just be careful. Have
you guided a ship in using the drive before?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, not as
such. But I do have an NDB locator."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's not
what Imean."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, have
you done an approach? As in hitting your target with the drive?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, no."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can I easily
practice that in home space somewhere?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be a
useful thing, if we knew the heading from New Earth to the Torus or something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To practice
approaches."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, you
could just go outa lightyear and then guide it back in to practice real quick if
you want. Just going to want to make sure you keep a close eye on the location
@s you get closer, and reduce your trim as you get closer to make it easier to
stay accur-te."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay. This
sounds like a first thing in the morning task."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wel, here's
the thing too, you are used to using the beacons between Mir and 77. Your speed
is going to be slower. If it is indeed 20 lightyears, it might take you a couple
of hours to even get out there, possibly more or less depending on the flow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm
worried I'd want to sleep before I got there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess I
could trim down to 1, right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But sleeping on
the way there is probably a bad idea when I don't know exactly how far it is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well. Yeah
you coul| trim down to 1, or even drop out and sleep while you drift, butyeah,
sleeping while rifting can bite you hard if you don't know exactly how far it
is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is going to
be the best."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That, my man,
is the fucking spirit. I love you for saying that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't fuck
with the snowglobe if it pops up in your ship. It's ok to talk to it maybe, if
you really want to, but I wouldn't handle it and definitely don't shake it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What happens if
I shake it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or put it
down your pants, like Herrick did."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You laugh,
but I'm serious."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What became of
Herrick?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It took his
penis. No wound or anything, but he carried the thing around in a cooler till he
could get it reattached."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Because he
put it down his pants."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone gasps.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well to be
honest that was a really weird thing for him to do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, I
agree."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "%t never did
anything that bad to me. But all I did was ever talk to it. Worst thing it ever
did to me was eat some stuff in my ship, and then spit it out all fused
together. It also tok herrick's workbench once, and made it appear on someone
elses ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, so this is
like a rift entity?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think
anyone hasa seen it |n a while."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Who blew up?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, I need to
finish this mission I'm on. And we'll talk more."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not me? I hope?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Did I hear
something about a snowglobe making someone into a eunuch?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but
reversibly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "=es, but I
can't talk more about it right now. From wht I understand, it didn't hurt
anything but his pride."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "It was Tara Flores apparently."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh no, what happened?"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "No idea."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When was this?"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Her pod landed just now."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aww."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Last I heard, she
was rifting somewhere. Maybe she fell asleep mid-rift?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "More likely she
dropped out in 777 and there were pirates."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But who knows."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, at least
she got capital insurance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's
supposed to be an auto-lander."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, well I hope
this isn't my fault. I didn't see anything about an autolander on Lily's list of
stuff for me to make."
[General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "The Fringe has far more
worlds."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hello."

[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Good night."
[General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "And hello."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good luck on
your trip constantine, I gotta get some sleep. If you're not back we'll try to
com efind ya."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. If anyone is
hunting for it, I will build the xeno when I wake up. I'm way too tired now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also,  try to
be around tomorrow around 23:00 to midnigt, if you can."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So like...in maybe 8
hours or so."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sorry for the delay,
but I've had stations to build every which way."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Subject: Telepathic Felo
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 13:46 22 July 2317 GST
--
This is not a trade, but an offer. I would like to see what's up with these
felo, so am spreading the word. There is a breed of felo that has popped up that
seems to be at least somewhat telepathic. Sometimes when they eat, those nearby
will see an image in their mind of the plant that used to be their main food
source on Grenwold. They show some other traits too, staring intently at one
another and at us. I have been breeding them and have at least two that I know
for sure that are kittens at the moment of writing. If anyone is interested in
helping me figure out if there's anything other than the telepathy with these
guys...if perhaps they can lead us to a way to help them be healthier...please
let me know in a letter. I repeat that this is an offer and I am not charging
for these guys. If you want to make one a pet, you will need to purchase tonic
at the Torus.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" and the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy
Flitter Corps Red 4" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can,
and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

[New Phoenix; Mexico Lane]
The scent of Mexican foods drifts toward you from the northwest. The AEU's
blackened tower looms above the smallish buildings here, but no one seems to pay
it any mind. The buildings seem to be mainly restaurants and wholesale shops.
Even though the entire area is rather dingy and poor-looking, as if the
colonists from the third world areas of Old Earth simply recreated their old
life here on new soil, it seems to have suffered little from the war. Business
is lively and the sounds of conversation in old languages can be heard all along
the street.

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone
here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of

This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a

make repairs to it while it's in use?"
tra 1 Nope.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Nope."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's often
a subtle change in the sound of the drive, if you hear that you can drop out and
make repairs before it breaks fully. That will save some time. But repairing it
alone always is going to take a little while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. That's
what that was, then."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably, 
yeah. Though sometimes it will still break suddenly with no warning."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If I can get my
ship fixed I'll be up for anything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I need one more
beacon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've only done two
beacons for this period. Feels bad."

a golden Feng Wo coin purse
This small golden silk brocade coin purse folds at the top, where it is secured
with a hidden snap.
It is open.
Inside it you see a pile of eight golden tael, three silver tael, a pile of
twenty-seven liang, a string of sixty qian, a string of eight hundred eleven
fen, a string of twenty-seven zhu, and a stack of nine hundred sixty-one Tom
Town scrip.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "How far are
you out still, Constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not far, I
reckon between 2 and 3 light years."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Unfortunately I
had to get some sleep so I trimmed way down."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I guess ran
the drive a little too long."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You would have
been proud though, the wind was blowing right in my face the whole way back so I
did some tacking."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nice job."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You got any
of the repairs done yet? There's external ones and internal ones."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just finished
inside and started up on the external ones."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wish I had
brought my early warning device."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though I guess I
can check my navaid every now and again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You should be
fine, it can't hurt to be safe, but there's not usually things lookin for
trouble that far out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you were
closer to Outsider space, or even closer to the beacon, I'd be more worried, but
chances are slim that something will spot you and get to you before you can fix
the drive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do you have a
long-ranged scanner?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I'm not
sure. The ship might, if that's something ships have."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I don't have
the points to buy one myself yet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, they
have some built in stuff that will let you see the residual pings and such, but
yeah you have to buy the scanner to be able to scan yourself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It shouldn't
take you too much longer, I imagine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I think
I've almost got it."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you familar
with the space-time anomaly about 5 light years out from b-24?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, You mean
UKN1?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, maybe that's
what it was."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well,
familiar is probably not the word I would use, I've heard of it, yes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I've never
seen it myself, Ather could probably tell you more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I noticed
both going out and coming back that the ship drops out immediately if I hit my
target close enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's pretty
nice."

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Great, we've
almost reached our first performance goal! Keep it up!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "When you are
coming into alliance sector beacons, they're often close enough together that
you might get pulled into a different one than even the one you were aiming at,
is that what you mean?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hm, maybe. But I
also didn't need to tell the rift drive to stop when I reached the debris
field."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just dropped
out when I got close."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If You're
trim is set low, and you leav from an alliance beacon, yeah, you will sometimes
instantly get pulled into a different one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, is there a
beacon out there?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, yeah
that's how it works. From my u nderstanding of it, the rift sorta pools around
places like that and even pulls you slightly towards them when you start getting
close. When you get close enough, it yanks you out all together."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Eli."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "I need to speak to you."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Old Earth."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm coming. Your usual

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Huh. I can't find
anybody that wants to buy these clothes. Feels like I've been to over a dozen
planets already."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Luxury clothes, eh?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can
give you a clue!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll gladly take a
clue."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
just can't tell you where exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Check
EAOS space."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Alright, thanks.
I'll continue exploring ports- but that'll narrow it down by a lot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Helios probably pays better for them, but well, last I knew, we can't trade to
Mutuality ports anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You
bought luxury clothing or standard clothing?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Luxury clothing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh,
it seems I was wrong! They don't buy it in EAOS space either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've already
searched all of AEU and League. I didn't imagine it'd be so difficult to find a
port willing to buy them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well,
most of the alliances already have access to luxury clothing and the like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "My
advice honestly, is to first go around the various trading centers, and check
their LIST of what they buy and sell. Then you can try experimenting with
various trade routes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've been keeping
record of the ports and what they buy and sell as I try to find someone to buy
these clothes, to avoid a problem like this in the future."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Good.
Keep records."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I
have records of most of the trading centers, but not all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Makes
thigns a lot easier, especially when we sometimes get special trade requests."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That must've taken
a good bit of time to put together."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "It
did, to be sure."
Minor Change: Battlesuit DAMAGE/ENERGY commands as well as the aerial fortress
DAMAGE command are now altered by the "no graphical ASCII" option.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And
it will probably require more work in future. I'd imagine in the future markets
will start fluctuating more, add more items etc. So I'll have to run to all of
them all over again."
[MTTS] usfolks: Thanks!
[General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau
Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "But
it's good to maintain trading records, even if you don't make it one of the
things you do most commonly."
[MTTS] usfolks: Just curious, does it also get rid of all the extra lines?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Yes.
[MTTS] atherj: For damage readouts, maybe. For everything else though, probably
not. Like charge was still like 5 lines.
[MTTS] atherj: Oh, I like what you did with the systems command, very nice. It
was still quite usable with the old method, but this is pretty neat.
[MTTS] ricolachen: It sends an extra 0 for damage/energy in the battlesuits.
[MTTS] Squidmind: There's a separate option to suppress lines of dashes, if
that's what you're talking about.
[MTTS] usfolks: Thanks Squid. That'll make a huge difference. With all the extra
lines it would fly past. And no, not the dashes, just the space taken up by the
ASCII meter.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The battlesuit commands give the current level, the maximum
level, and the percentage. So if you're undamaged, there should be a zero, your
maximum damage number, then another zero.
[MTTS] ricolachen: It's like, Energy Level: 220/220 [100%]. Then another line,
0.
[MTTS] usfolks: I'm very much looking forward to seeing this. It's much
appreciated. I didn't use those commands because of all the extra space taken up
by the meter. This makes them usable again for me.
[MTTS] ricolachen: Now it's fixed. Thanks!
[MTTS] Squidmind: No problem.
[MTTS] usfolks: You guys rock.
[MTTS] Butchulla: You are appreciated and loved, hosties.
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Did more people go out of comms?"
[MTTS] Ulias: Yes, yes. These are all great changes. I have a lot of things
already gagged, but even the gagging seems to slow things down a bit. I've
already noticed a slight difference in how quick my text starts getting read.

[MTTS] Squidmind: VIPmud is not exactly a paragon of efficiency, from everything
I've ever heard.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, here's an idea.
Let's all leave too."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yes. She went along
on the trip. I honestly don't have a trip length I can tell you Ash. I do know
that their plan is Andy's, then Tom Town, then I believe east from there."
[MTTS] Ulias: I actually still use GMUD.
[MTTS] atherj: ...
[MTTS] usfolks: Wow. I used GMUD 11 years ago...
[MTTS] atherj: People still use GMUD?
[MTTS] Ulias: No, not people. Just me apparently.
[MTTS] atherj: Eh, to be honest I would still use GMUD if there was a way of
making it play multiple sounds at once. I am guilty.
[MTTS] usfolks: My experience with VIPMud as a low-vision player was not that
great.
[MTTS] kaite: Wow yeah I haven't used GMUD in several years although I put in
triggers for sounds.
[MTTS] atherj: Usfolks, did you try the invert colors option?
[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah the sounds do cut each other off when they play, Luckily
Ionly use like four sounds so it works fine.
[MTTS] usfolks: If only I could figure out this sound buffers issue I have in
MUSH I'd be golden. And yes atherj. It would only do black on black...and I
couldn't change or enlarge the font.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Wow, GMUD. That brings back memories.
[MTTS] atherj: I.E, making it white text on a black background?
[MTTS] atherj: Oh, yeah, you can't do that, tis true.
[MTTS] usfolks: Whenever I tried to do white on black, it would be black on
black. I tried for about two weeks and gave up.
[MTTS] atherj: Everyone says that mush is probably the best client out there,
I'm just too lazy to recreate all my stuff.
[MTTS] usfolks: I did all mine from scratch.
[MTTS] atherj: I did all mine from scratch too.
[MTTS] voyager1000: When I was low vision, I inverted VIPMud's color scheme to
make it readable white on black. Had I known about mush when I got into mudding
I wouldn't have paid for VIP. It's not too bad, it's simple and it works for the
most part.
[MTTS] usfolks: Can't figure out any kind of gagging or the sound buffers.
Someone showed me how to do the sound buffers but I just get errors.
[MTTS] atherj: Just hate the thought of doing them from scratch again on a
client where I'd be learning as I was going along.
[MTTS] Butchulla: I can't choose a client, because when I'm using my eyes one is
better, when I can't use my eyes, another is better. So I just...Deal.
[MTTS] usfolks: It's just a simple dialog box in MUSH. Easy enough to enter your
triggers from VIP from the text file.
[MTTS] usfolks: No gags though.
[MTTS] atherj: Yeah, I want gags. Maybe not for SC, but for others.
[MTTS] ricolachen: I have a VIPMud to MUSHClient converter, but I'm still using
VIP for most of my MUDing. I've coded my own output plugin for MUSH but it's not
as stable as VIPMud's output.
[MTTS] Butchulla: There should so be a squidMUD. I'd buy it.
[MTTS] usfolks: If I could take the sound stuff from VIP and the visual from
MUSH, it would be perfect.
[MTTS] atherj: Have you ever thought of writing to the developer of vipmud?
[MTTS] Ulias: If Squidmind came out with a VI friendly client, I bet it would be
incredible.
[MTTS] usfolks: I have atherj, but considering I'm only having a small issue
with MUSH, it's not all that worth it. I'm pretty used to what I can do with
MUSH.
[MTTS] ricolachen: Also, MUSH has gags?
[MTTS] Ulias: Maybe they could get Belk to like, make a bunch of noises using
his mouth to use for sounds, "pew pew pew"
[MTTS] Butchulla: Hahaha.
[MTTS] usfolks: Plus, since I know others can get it to work, it's on my end,
not a client issue. And ricolachen, I haven't figured out how in any of the
documentation.
[MTTS] voyager1000: The main issue I had with VIP when I could see wasn't the
colors, it was the inability to adjust the font size.
[MTTS] usfolks: Exactly. And for me it's not just the size, it's the font
itself.
[MTTS] Squidmind: We did approve a soundpack at one time, but last I checked,
the website had disappeared.
[MTTS] ricolachen: It's just a simple checkbox in the trigger dialogue box. It's
something like, 'remove it from the output'
[MTTS] usfolks: I can't read fixed-width fonts very well.
[MTTS] usfolks: Is that the randomcorner one Squid?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Yes.
[MTTS] usfolks: I had no idea that had disappeared.
[MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah, but...A squid mud client, that would be wicked.
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh weird.
[MTTS] atherj: I just like creating my own. It's a very simple one without all
the annoying bells and whistles that people tend to put into theirs, and I can
be reasonably sure that mine has no cheatery in it!
[MTTS] voyager1000: I've had this sound pack for years now. I'm used to certain
sounds for certain events.
[MTTS] atherj: I've seen some soundpacks that have triggers for the most
ridiculous crap; kissing, slapping, sitting, standing...bit too much for me.
[MTTS] usfolks: Same atherj. I don't want room sounds, felo sounds, all the
social sounds, etc. Just stuff specifically necessary for accessibility.
[MTTS] kaite: Me either and I typically turn them off or go comment out the
references.
[MTTS] Ulias: Yeah, that's the exact reason I stopped using a soundpack, I got
tired of it constantly whispering "hey" everytime someone said something.
[MTTS] atherj: Oh gosh they do that too now? Fuck that.
[MTTS] Ulias: And whispering and all that stuff.
[MTTS] Ulias: Er whistling.
[MTTS] usfolks: I have a simple beep sound for most say's. It gets my attention
if I'm in another window and that's it.
[MTTS] Ulias: I don't know if they all do, but the one that I tried for VIPmud
was constantly whisper"Hey"
[MTTS] voyager1000: I have this sort of breath sound whenever someone says
something.
[MTTS] atherj: I don't even have that much. The only sound that I have as an
indicator for me besides communicator sounds that someone is trying to reach me
is a telephone ringing sound for the einrophone.
[MTTS] kaite: There is one site where they do a lot of two-year-old screaming
and it is just because I know they like to trigger those sounds. It's rediculous
and am so glad that isn't encouraged here.
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. I viewed the text files for several old ones and picked
and chose stuff that I wanted and needed.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I don't like someone to laugh and then to hear a gender
specific laugh sound. It breaks everything for me.
[MTTS] usfolks: Then used balabolka to make some TTS sounds for things I needed.
[MTTS] usfolks: Understood voyager1000.
[MTTS] voyager1000: Since the pack doesn't differentiate between male and
female.
[MTTS] atherj: Bah, the sounds for roleplay interactions limit your imagination
and are just annoying.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I'm working hard to avoid using built-in socials anyway.
[MTTS] Ulias: Yep, not having it spoon-fed to me is one of the things I fell in
love with when it comes to these kinds games in the first place.
[MTTS] usfolks: Hear hear atherj.
[MTTS] Ulias: Using our imaginations is what makes these games great.
[MTTS] usfolks: Indeed.
[MTTS] Ulias: And Sc is the greatest!
[MTTS] usfolks: Quite so.
[MTTS] kaite: Yup I used GMUD when first started playing here and had no sounds
for anything for except for what I could add and I had trouble with gmud because
if the word.lis or whatever it's called file, if it gets too large, it crashes.
[MTTS] Butchulla: All hail SC? It's too early in the morning for this complex
discussion.
[MTTS] Ulias: I still regret not having to been able to check out Fortharlin.
I'd love to see that Squidmind take on fantasy.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I missed out on that too.
[MTTS] kaite: Same.
[MTTS] atherj: I would love love love to see work on fortharlin start back up
again. Best midevil game out there ever. Better than any of the stupid ones
available now, even in its older form.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting
close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"
[MTTS] Ulias: Everything I've ever heard about it on tis channel sounded
amazing.
[MTTS] Ulias: GWSE sounded cool too, but we don't need another space game. That
would just take away from SC.
[MTTS] usfolks: I kind of wish I could get into fantasy, but never much could.
Was always a sci-fi person...and while so many have told me they go
hand-in-hand, I just never could get into it.
[MTTS] atherj: Yeha, I'd rather see work on Fortharlin than GW:SE.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I have grinding moods sometimes, that's usually a week or
two of Alter and then I'm done.
[MTTS] Ulias: Fortharlin didn't sound like it was about grinding at al.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I've not heard much about it.
[MTTS] kaite: Well my first mudding experience was on a couple of those and I
occasionally go back to one when I need a break so I do enjoy it and it's a good
way to bash at something without harming soemthing in real life hehe.
[MTTS] atherj: Na. Not grinding in its usual forms, to be sure. Though there
were a few things you could technically have grinded out if you wanted to.
[MTTS] Ulias: I actually think of it when we're in the carriage riftscape,
because I heard you had to take carriages and they took like hours to get to
places and so forth.
[MTTS] atherj: Sometimes days.
[MTTS] atherj: If you didn't have access to a waystone.
[MTTS] Ulias: Tht's prety awesome though, if you have someone to RP with.
[MTTS] atherj: Pretty sure that was the idea, yep.
[MTTS] atherj: You could also buy your own mounts and everything. You had to
deal with tiredness/hunger/thirst too, they had a more noticeable impact on your
stats and the like.
[MTTS] usfolks: My first introduction to mudding was Aardwolf for about two
weeks. When a friend tried to get me to play SC I said no for some time...then
they told me how different it was from Aardwolf...and I tried it. And am very
glad I did.
[MTTS] Ulias: Wasn't it permadeath too, though?
[MTTS] atherj: I was a flying fighter dude. I was working towards becoming a
bladedancer.
[MTTS] atherj: There were possibilities of resurrection on Fortharlin.
[MTTS] atherj: Just like there were possibilities of resurrection on GW:SE if
you remembered to clone yourself when you came back to life!
[MTTS] Squidmind: We've outlined most of a Fortharlin revision, did that years
ago, in fact, but actually accomplishing it is a great deal more work.
[MTTS] atherj: I remember you guys mentioning what some of those would be.
[MTTS] atherj: They actually did sound pretty cool.
[MTTS] atherj: Weren't you guys planning on a classless system where you could
just learn whatever skills?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Yes. The skill web. Training in one skill would unlock access
to related skills, and given enough time, you could make your way to any skill
you wanted. Though there would've been tradeoffs too, of course.

yo,
So, the real issue here is you took some time to make this decision to come
home. You could have been forming a letter for me to bring home during the
several hours in which Akemi informed you I was coming and the time that I got
to Andy's.
You did not then have to come home and try to put this on me. I did not rush
you. You had many hours to decide this stuff. I even asked you, before I left,
if these are the things you wanted me to relay back home. You said yes.
Yes I was upset when I left because somebody was murdered, another beaten, arson
to a library and one of mine stabbed. It didn't matter who requested you come
home. What mattered was, crap was going down and you weren't coming, at that
time, because people of your alliance did not ask for you specifically.
I was not rude to you nor did I pressure you into not giving a statement by
leaving quickly. You could have easily said hold on, let me write something
while you eat. You could have said, rest a little bit and let me think on this
issue. You did none of these things and then tried to make it look like it's my
fault for not giving you time.
Yes I am upset by that because I only came out there to help and get this shit
thrown in my face as thanks. I am mostly upset because of this. I should have
never found you guys at Andy's, you should have been on your way home and I
don't care whose ship it is. Important things were going on here.

Enclosed is the letter that I sent Lily. It doesn't matter who told me what,
what matters is she was going to throw me under the bus to save her ass. This is
why I posted my issue on general. So that I would not be posting it just on
League and going behind her back.
So, that's that and how I feel. I would have never done that to her. I did not
do the shit I am being accused of. Anyway, I am done.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cackles!
Eli Grey glances down at his gleaming silver pocket watch momentarily.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa nods to Eli Grey.
Eli Grey says, "Whoops showtime."
Eli Grey enters the studio.
[Public Access Studio]
You see a cream-colored chair, a cream-colored sofa, a small wooden end table, a
tridimensional holocamera, a cream-colored speakerphone, a sign reading "Call-in
Number: 1111-47612", and a backdrop projector here.
Eli Grey and Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa are standing here. Ryo Stel is leaning
against a wall.
You can go out.
Eli Grey switches a backdrop projector to "AEU phoenix symbol."
Eli Grey straights a long white coat with a dragonfly embroidered on the back.
Eli stands in front of an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop and looks into the camera.
He clears his throat and begins to speak, "Greetings once again citizens of the
Union, and the galaxy. we've come here once again tonight to speak about the
importance of the Union remaining in the Accord. i had never intended for this
to become a weekly broadcast, however has negotiations move forward and time
becomes shorter and shorter, we must not give up now."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] 160,000,000.00 credits have
been deducted from the starship support fund.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "The results
are in!"
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives
a new notice.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.
Eli Grey says, "In our previous broadcasts, I've discussed the desctruction of
several places by the aliens that threaten humanity. Tonight however, I would
like to talk a little about something that will hit a little closer to home.
Outsider Enforcer Drones."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We did not
achieve any of our performance goals."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our
performance was up 7.9% from the last Conquest period. Good job!"
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa stands off to one side and slightly behind Eli and
glances around, his optics unit clicking and whirrring quietly.
Eli holds up a photo of the destroyed AEU headquarters in New Phoenix.
Eli Grey says, "This is a photo of the destroyed headquarters in New Phoenix, it
was destroyed during Outsider bombardments and still stands like this today, a
grim reminder of those days. The Outsiders may be gone from our space for now,
thanks to the Accord, but we've yet to speak of these drones on this broadcast."
Eli Grey says, "These drones were used by the Outsiders to occupy human worlds.
Cold, calculating machines that insured that humanity abided by the Outsiders
rules. Doubtless many of you already know this, though it seems it bears
repeating."
Eli looks gravely into the camera, "In fact many of these drones are still
active on human world's. civilian pilots are deployed on missions to destroy
them, and destroy the transmission towers that issue their orders. they reside
in areas where reconstruction hasn't even begun yet, because of their presence.
"
Eli Grey says, "They are combated through the use of armored battlesuits,
created and distributed through the cooperation of Masterson with the Accord.
Without these battlesuits humanity was unable to drive them from our worlds. It
was these very same battlesuits that allowed humanity to finally claim victory
of the alien mothership in the final battles of the resistance."
Eli Grey says, "These suits, have gone on to help humanity with other problems
as well. They are regularly used to destroy Replicator nests, as well as keeping
the vents of the Old Frontier Processor clear of bari, allowing for civilian
pilots to mine for valuable resources and have even been used to combat
occupation by human terrosts. None of which would have been possible without the
combined knowledge and power of the alliances working through the Accord.
Without the Accord,  these suits simply would not exist, and neither would
humanity."
Eli allows the words to hang in the air for a moment, staring seriously into the
camera. He turns briefly to appraise his fellow pilots and then back to the
camera, nodding.
Eli's face grows sad as he speaks, "the withdrawl from the Accord, also means
that non-Union people living on Union world's will be forced from their homes,
and offworld, according to the recent headlines.
"No matter how you may feel about other alliances, the people that live on Union
worlds are our friends, our neighbors." Eli Grey shakes his head as if to
himself. "Doubtless many of you know one or more of these people. Perhaps they
cut your hair, or sell you your groceries? Do we really want this for them? If
you are saying 'What do I care about a bunch of non-Unioners?'then consider
this, these people spend credits here. they pay their rents, buy our products
and even contribute to their local communities. How will such a loss in our
economy affect all of us? this is yet another reason that leaving the Accord is
a bad plan for the future of the Union."
Eli Grey says, "It's been shown recently that the Accord will continue to allow
the Union pilots to use their facilities upon withdrawl. This may put some of
you at ease, hoever this access is meanginless without the Union actively
contributing. The combined contributions of all alliances through the Accord is
the only thing currently keeping human space safe."
[MTTS] atherj: I didn't even know we could disassemble stations. Shows how much
I've been building stations lately.
Eli Grey coughs. "However this access is meaningless, I mean."
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah, I found that out when I messed something up royally one
day.
[MTTS] Butchulla: If you haven't actually combined the core, you can.
[MTTS] usfolks: Actually, on a constructor you still can.
Eli Grey says, "The Union simply must not withdrawl. It is imperative that the
Unions great scientists and military continue to work together with other
alliances through the Accord, for the sake of all of us."
[MTTS] Butchulla: Oh, well yeah, that makes sense. I was thinking without one.
[MTTS] usfolks: It's until the very last step...whatever that is for the ship
you're using.
Eli Grey glances at Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa.
Eli Grey asks, "I would like to turn it over to Ace pilot Ather Jammoa now. This
wearer of the Velourian Star has seen first hand the power of the threats that
await us in the dark of space, and also how the Accord has helped to combat
those threats... mister Jammoa?"
[MTTS] kaite: You can but it's jsut an accident waiting to happen. Trust me have
done the same thing but caught it before deployment and was able to disassemble
but a bit tedious to say the least.
Eli Grey asks, "Do you have some things you would like to add?"
[MTTS] usfolks: So on a mod transport it's combining the core, on a constructor
it's launching. And I'm so glad it's available...it's fixed a lot of sticky
situations.
Ather nods at Eli and steps forward, clearing his throat with a mechanical cough
and fixing his gaze on the camera.
Eli steps back from an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop.
[MTTS] usfolks: Disassembling isn't an accident waiting to happen, it's a
solution to an accident.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Eli here did a great job at telling you all
why it's so important that we stay in the Accord. I just want to say a few more
things which will hopefully drive the point home for those citizens who are
still thinking about things."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "I know we're almost out of time, so I'll try
to be brief."
Eli smiles almost imperceptibly.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "First and foremost, I want to say that as a
peoples, we have all been privilaged to live during interesting times. In spite
of the lost technology which the Outsiders took from us back during the war, we
have still made incredible advancement in spaceflight and a whole host of other
areas."
[MTTS] Butchulla: Oh yes. With all the matching mess that you can sometimes
get...I've come close to very pretty disasters before myself.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "However, all of that could be taken away
from us in an instant."
Eli Grey nods.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "The Outsider threat is still real. Take it
from someone who has fought them on numerous occasions before, the Outsiders
have not gone away yet. They will never go away. They want to see the extinction
of humanity, and are biding their time only for reasons we don't yet understand,
not because we can beat them."
[MTTS] usfolks: Yeah. Especially when my char first started building stations.
I'm so glad they give us so many chances to fix our mistakes.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Only a year or so ago in fact, we fought
Outsider starships with incredibly strong armor. Armor that even made it
difficult for a cruiser to destroy them. Imagine what would happen if we faced a
much larger fleet of those ships. I can tell you what would happen fellow
citizens, we wouldn't stand a chance on our own."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "And a lot of those ships were only Outsider
Martial-class heavy fighters. Small ships, in the grand scheme."
[MTTS] davetaylor: God, I'm still paranoid when I build stations, I spend ages
making sure what I want is on the right lifter, in the right order and
everything, heaven knows what I'd do if I was building two at once.
[MTTS] Ulias has left the channel.
Ather's optics unit dims slightly, the glow taking on a slight reddish hew as he
continues, "Anyone in the Union who is of age and older now knows what the
Outsiders are capable of. Most of you should still remember the bombings which
destroyed, for example, the AEU headquarters as Eli indicated at the beginning
of this broadcast. Do we really want to go through that again?"
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "That should prove to everyone that the
Outsiders do have the means to do what they want to do. They are just not doing
it at this moment. However, it doesn't mean that they won't. It means that
they're waiting for what they believe is the right time."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "We all have theories on what those right
times are supposedly are, I'm not going to get into that. However, you should
know that just because they're only attacking in small numbers for now, doesn't
mean that they will not attack with the same overwhelming force that they used
during the war in the future."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "That reason, as well as others that were
mentioned, are among the many reasons why it's imparative we stay in the Accord.
Together with the other alliances, our chances of fighting the Outsiders as well
as other enemies off and saving our people increases. If we fight on our own,
then we're likely all going to be destroyed. Alone and without the fighting
chance that we were all hoping for."
eta
I don't understand that.
Ather raises a hand as he concludes by saying, "I hope President Best and the
current administration takes this councel to heart. That they ultimately decide
to do not only what is best for the Union, but for the whole of humanity as
well, by remaining in the Accord and contributing to research that can help
combat the Outsiders, as well as the other threats that we face." After he stops
speaking, he keeps his unblinking mechanical gaze locked onto the camera for
several seconds, then finally turns away and nods at Eli.
Eli returns to stand in front of an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop.
"I would like to point out that the armored ships that mister Jammoa mentioned,
were only taken down with the suits I mentioned at the beginning of this
broadcast." Eli Grey nods. "Yet another use for the technology created through
the combined effots of the Accord."
Ather gives an imperceptible shake of his head.
A glowing clock blinks silently, giving you your five minute warning.
A glowing clock blinks silently, giving you your five minute warning.
Eli Grey says, "Oh.. perhaps I'm thinking of the wrong ships."
Eli Grey coughs.
Ryo Stel grins at Eli Grey.
Eli Grey says, "I'll conclude tonight with this. To the citizens who have heard
our broadcast, mae your opinions on this matter known. Start discussions with
your friends, your co-workers. Spread the word about the importance of remaining
in the Accord. To the members of governmentt who are actiely fighting against
this, please keep fighting.. We're al counting on you. May you all find peace
and joy in your lives."
Eli thrusts his fist in the air and loudly exclaims, "for the Union, the Accord,
and humanity!"
Ryo Stel cheers for Eli Grey!
Ryo says to Eli, "Well said."
Eli leads his fellow pilots toward the exit, revealing the dragonfly on his
back, and leaving an AEU phoenix symbol backdrop remaining on the screen.
You follow Eli Grey out.

Ryo Stel stops leaning against a wall.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach cheers.
Eli says to Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa, "Ugh I thought you were talking about
armored thralls."
Eli Grey slams his hand into his forehead.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Very well said."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "You got that one wrong, unfortunately. I
hope they don't get you for it."
Ryo Stel says to Eli, "Very well said."
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Those are different vessels, but still no
less dangerous. Those ships cannot be destroyed utilizing only conventional
shipboard weapons and require, as Eli pointed out, an attack using battlesuits.
These specific warships which I mentioned, were specifically of Outsider design,
and could be destroyed with conventional weapons. It just took a lot of work."
Eli Grey says, "Well if they do, they do. It'll just sho tthey they have no good
arguemnts against any of this."
Ryo Stel nods.
Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa nods.
Eli Grey says, "Just like the nitpicking over the experimental structure last
time."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

you have it folks. You're getting a privatised corps anyways."
[General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "What does
privitized be meaning?"
[MTTS] lunarfang: Ok. I'm going to sound really stupid but what does that mean.
Does that mean he's making the core private so not just anyone can join? Or am I
missing the point intirely.

[MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, it is.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

to push it into your path. The road is in obvious bad repair, but you don't pay
it much mind, keeping your eyes on the horizon. Faint sounds of animal life can
be heard over the wind. On the west side of the road the grass has been
trampled, and you can see a faint trail leading from here through the grassy
countryside. In addition, a bright red and white sign on the other side of the
road points the way down a clear path to the Felo Sanctuary to the east.
You can go north, east, and south.

Long grass waves in the breeze along this straight path. Though the path is
unpaved, the dirt has been packed down and is marked by faint vehicle tracks.
The air is fresh and cool. About a quarter-mile away to the east, a white
warehouse-like building stands up out of the waving grass.

This quiet path is framed by tall grass waving in the wind. The air is fresh but
smells occasionally of wet fur. A large white warehouse stands up out of the
grass about a fifth of a mile to the east. Above the grass in a generally
northwestern direction, you can see the faint gleam of the spaceport.

The path ends here in a clearing in the tall grass. The clearing is only twenty
feet wide, as though whoever made it wanted to have as little impact on the
environment as possible. On the east side of it is a squarish white building,
its plain facade decorated with a painted arch formed of the colorful
silhouettes of small cat-like creatures. In the center of the wall is a small
door with a large sign that you can LOOK at beside it and a bright red box
marked 'Donations!' beneath it. Extending from the building into the grass on
either side is a very high square-link fence which leaves narrow open spaces on
either side where the interior of the compound is visible.

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I used that grapple
for the longest time, till I thought to try a mighty."
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't even know the
particular difference, I just remember reading that mighty is great."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "In some ways, they can
be better than a mighty, but the mighty is better just based off how much time
it saves."

things, where the fine-toothed is probably better in theory, but the mighty is
better in practice."

fat."

starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Hyperion; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is

1. You encounter a hostile force in deep space that clearly outmatches your own.
What do you do and why?
I would attempt to destroy any chaining or interdicting ships before engaging
other ships in case I need to run. Having done so, I would attempt to cripple
the hostile force as much as possible. If the hostile force is left alone, it
could very well be strengthened by other forces in the area before finding its
way to civilian locations and causing destruction.

2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
I would report my location, the number of ships and their classes over tactical
and ask for reinforcements. Then I would engage them as above, attempting to
make sure I have the ability to run and get repairs if necessary. With it being
a direct threat to a civilian location, I would continue to fight the ships
until they are all destroyed. If my ship gets destroyed, I would just grab
another ship. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human space from all
threats.

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
I prefer to be short one gunner. Since AEU ships rely primarily on their lasers
and as such, use a lot of grid, I would much rather have someone able to
recharge the grid. IF the grid is completely drained, the ship's weapons become
much less effective. Against such ships as rapid assault ships or any assault
warpers, it is imperative that these ships be destroyed as quickly as possible.
When the ship does Get hit, the engineer's ability to be able to use a quick
patch readily can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not. Another
advantage of being short one gunner as opposed to being short an engineer is
that if the grid does get depleted in one weapon room, the gunner can move to
the empty weapons room until such time that their original weapon room is fully
charged again.

4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving
soon. What actions do you take?
I engage any ships that are chaining me, destroy any interdictors and any ships
that are interdicting all the while getting as close to the edge as possible in
order to make a quick get away. Having taken note of the number of ships that
remain, I then land, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine how
many ships are in the hostile sector. I would wait long enough to find out how
many enemy ships responded as reinforcements. I would report all of this over
tactical and ask for assistance. If I am unable to escape from the sector, I
keep the ship moving, make repairs, land if possible and request assistance over
tactical.

5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
We engage and destroy the escorting ships and leave the sector as a mothership
cannot be destroyed by conventional weapons. The last mothership had to be
destroyed with the use of battle suits. Therefore, we leave and don't come back
unless we have cruisers that have the special shielding that can repel the PDB
and battle suits.

What do you do and why?
Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.
I engage any interdicting or chaining ships first then any other small ships
that I can destroy before leaving. My goal would be to cripple the hostile force
as much as possible. If they are left alone, they could be strengthened and find
their way to beacon sectors and attack civilian locations.

2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
I would report my current location, number of ships and their classes over
tactical asking for reinforcements. While reinforcements are on the way, I would
engage any chaining or interdicting ships and destroy any interdictors to enable
friendly ships to be able to leave and obtain repairs. I would also recommend
that a crew be placed on stand-by at the civilian location that is being
threatened. Then I would set about destroying as many enemy ships as possible.

You entered: I would report my location, number and class of enemy ships and
request reinforcements over tactical. I would also recommend that a crew be
placed on stand-by at the civilian location. While reinforcements are on the
way, I would engage any chaining ships, interdicting ships as well as destroy
any interdictors in the sector. Then I would simply attempt to destroy all of
the enemy ships. It is my duty and responsibility to protect human alliance
space from all hostile threats.

3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
I would much rather be short one gunner. As AEU ships rely heavily on lasers
that drain the grid rather quickly, it is imperative that someone is able to
recharge the grid as frequently as possible. If the combat grid is depleted, the
ship's weapons lose their effectiveness. Another advantage of being short a
gunner is that if a gunner's combat grid is drained, he or she can move to the
empty weapons room until such time that their original weapons room's grid is
recharged. If the ship does get hit, the ability of the engineer to apply quick
patches to the hull can be the difference between losing a failsafe or not.
Experienced engineers also can have access to tools that can increase the damage
for a single weapon room thereby helping to compensate for being short a gunner.

in the sector all the while staying close to the edge in order to make a quick
get away. Having taken note of the number of ships remaining in the sector, I
leave, obtain repairs, and use long-range scans to determine the number of the
reinforcing ships. I report all of this over tactical and ask for
reinforcements.

regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
We destroy the escorting ships and leave since this kind of ship cannot be
destroyed by conventional weapons. The last magistrate-class mothership had to
be captured with the use of battle suits. We contact the Accord and don't come
back without cruisers that have been adapted with special shielding that can
repel a PDB and battle suits.

My priority would be the capitol planets as they are the most inhabited and also
the primary beacon sectors since they are used the most and one must fly through
those sectors to get to capitol sectors. If, for example, providence Gate were
to be interdicted, other ships would not be able to get to New Earth until such
time that Providence Gate was no longer interdicted.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

you had a chance to vote? It's probably about time to close the vote."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hell, I forgot
about that. Thanks, I had meant to come by and register my vote."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It would be
better if more of our pilots were in homespace, but we can't wait on them to
come back. Especially without knowing exactly how much longer they'll be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I seriously
doubt it's going to matter, since Best doesn't even want us really ahnging out
with unregs, let alone going to their space and their stations. But at least
this way, it will be a matter of public record that we wanted to."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I don't know any
unregs, but I do know that I'm hating not being able to trade."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, that's

Union relations have gone increasingly sour over the years though, it's gonna be
an uphill battle to turn that around."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Luckily, they
see people as individuals for the most part, not extensions of their alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I still don't think
it'd be great if we lost use of the skims."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You will
likely find unregs quite interesting when you meet them.. They're um.. different
for sure. We alliance folks could probably learn a lot from the way they live."

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
m`xcR{eEM7"dNf52J#m<i9cg7-y"+d;K5vH(y1~P
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds
unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
The computer reports that the two-person bolt thrower "Redemption" has jumped
out of the sector.
The computer reports that the reconnaissance craft "Is This A Dagger Which I See
Before Me?" has jumped out of the sector.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

l aquarium
a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic
life and coral rocks
An utterly massive aquarium designed to decorate an entire wall.
It is filled with water.
It is closed.
Inside it you see a plastic frond of light green sea fern, a white plastic
undersea castle, a small plastic statue of a Jinu, a plastic flower with red
petals, a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender, a string of light purple plastic kelp,
a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag, and a small plastic statue of a shark.
It appears that there are ample food particles in the water.
A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles, a firmly
rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils, a firmly rooted animal with
dozens of rough green tendrils, a long red soft-bodied creature with many

Shine the big white glowing felo
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely cat-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, speckled white fur,
possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked white claws
visible. A white, square nose sits below a pair of clear blue eyes with vertical
pupils. It puts out a subtle white bioluminescence tinged with light green.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
%Zv8F8G}UM1[&+Nb|MxD,waOzRDHrcw8*_gXayn.
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds
unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Firestorm.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

Along this twenty-meter-long section of curving corridor are several doorways,
each set into a shallow alcove with a keypad beside it. In the dim but steady
light, you can see a metal plaque on one of the doorways, reading, 'Damage
Control.' Visitors wandering into this area usually get a stern look from
station personnel passing by, while familiar faces get a nod of recognition. It

Smoothly curved and polished metal girders protrude slightly from the finished
walls here, almost decorative in their spacing along the corridor and in the
semicircular wheel-like brace overhead where the girders meet. The light is dim
but steady, provided by tall glowing panels that match the curvature of the
walls. Along the corridor are several doorways set into shallow alcoves, one
identified as 'Trade Licensing and Certification,' though entrance into that
area requires a code unlikely to be known by civilian pilots.

A few advertisements for shops elsewhere in the station have been affixed to the

and few people venture by. On the north end of the corridor, a wide hatch leads
out into the outring. From here you can see through the hatch to the lights of
one of the station's main security offices, this one located at the north point
of the ring. Toward the south is the station's hub, its light and noise a marked

to the floor, is the doorway to a store where hydroponically grown plants are
sold, and on the east side is a container shop, its doorway decorated with rows
of bags firmly glued to a display stand. The station hub is to the south, and

the walls and meeting perhaps six meters overhead in a semicircular wheel-like
brace. Between the girders are alcoves containing doorways marked as various
station offices. One of the doorways here has a metal sign bolted to it,
reading, 'Personnel,' and some of the traffic in this area consists of station
workers coming to read the notices mounted to a board beside the doorway.

ceiling. The walls are smudged in places with oil and grease, and between the
curved girders that support them are several stacks of plastic-covered crates.
On the west side of the area is a wide, open hatch leading into a spacious,
well-lit corridor extending toward the station's central hub, while smaller
hatches to the north and south allow access to the outring around the station.
The sounds of ships landing and launching occasionally come from the corridor
leading east from here. Additionally, built into the wall on the northeast side
of the area, is circular stairway leading downward to a lower level of the

crowded restaurant, a rather seedy bar, and a gaudy souvenir shop. In addition
to the shoppers milling about, traders and travelers gather in small groups
around a wide circular stairway in the middle of the hub. Apart from them are
station residents, known by their relaxed manner and dress. Around the perimeter
of the hub are wide corridors leading north, south, east, and west to other

their orders and jostling each other as they find seating on the benches pulled

[ITPN Main Circuit Pod One]
This transport pod is spheroid, with a broad band of transparent plasteel around
its center. Several rows of seats line the inner edge, and each seat is equipped
with a bit of rubberized webbing to secure its passenger. Small displays next to
each seat provide the ROUTE for this pod, with the current destination always at
the top of the list. A chromed ring of tubular plasteel is mounted to the
ceiling, with a number of hand grips dangling from it for those who choose to
remain standing. Soft carpeting in a subtle blue and black ripple pattern covers
the floor.
You can go out.
You feel sudden acceleration as the pod begins travelling to the next stop.

This square room of pale gray walls and polished metal girders is centered
around a platform where transport pods occasionally land and then take off
through a broad hole in the ceiling. A thick metal railing surrounds the
platform, which is accessed by a set of metal stairs attended by a white-gloved
ITPN agent. Large portholes in the bulkhead provide lonely views of deep space.
Informational displays hang on the four walls, providing estimated times of
arrival and departure. A stairway leads down to the corridor below.

[Space Station "Tandem"; Accessway]
In this long corridor, polished metal girders matching the curvature of the pale
gray walls arc overhead, except on the far wall where a set of stairs leading up
to the ITPN Station has been built along the outer bulkhead. Tall lighted panels
are recessed into the walls, and the metal mesh of the floor allows warm air to
circulate upward from the ventilation system beneath. Beyond a wide hatch to the
north, technicians and mechanics can be seen rushing around in the station's
Repair and Rearm facility, while the starship supply store to the south seems
relatively quiet with several large unopened crates stacked beside the hatch
there. To the west is another wide hatch leading to a cavernous space that can
only be one of the station's docking bays.

About ten meters across and twice as long to the north and south, this section
of smoothly finished gray corridor curves slightly as part of the outer ring of
the station, commonly called the Outring. Polished metal girders protrude from
the walls, which arch gradually to meet overhead. Though the light here is never
bright, the tall glowing panels recessed into the walls provide a steady
illumination. On the east side of this area is a wide, open hatch leading into a
spacious corridor extending toward the center of the station. Smaller hatches
follow the outring around the station to the north and south, and the sounds of
ships landing and launching often comes from the corridor leading west from
here. In one corner of the intersection, a narrow circular set of stairs leads
down to a lower level.
