00:14 Lily Kaise asks, "Well no but paste?"

00:14 Evenia Callseah says, "As nasty as it is, this area could be far worse. I mean...we aren't running in hamster wheels like Eli told me he did. We can be thankful for that. We also aren't in a cage."

00:14 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Even regular hospital food would do!"

00:14 Lily Kaise says, "True."

00:14 Katina Faye asks, "Eli was running on a hamster wheel?"

00:14 Cheri says to Lily, "Did you ever use those food synthesizers from Helios?"

00:14 Evenia Callseah nods to Katina Faye.

00:14 Lily Kaise says, "And there's nice beds in the women's ward."

00:15 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I have a set thanks to sweet Katina."

00:15 Evenia says to Katina, "When he had the accident that made him glow. He was in a cage. With a wheel. And water feeder thing."

00:15 Katina Faye blushes.

00:15 Katina says to Evenia, "Oh my."

00:15 Katina says to Evenia, "Why?"

00:15 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, it's unreggish food, and a lot of it is synthbeef, like that nice bacon."

00:15 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well you know I don't mind it."

00:15 Lily says to Cheri, "I really prefer most unreg food."

00:16 Katina says to Evenia, "Were they running tests?"

00:16 Evenia says to Katina, "Because they needed to make sure he wasn't gonna turn into some three-headed monster or something. So he was closely watched."

00:16 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, it's like paste, not exactly but a lot like it. Just think about the food here like unshaped synthbeef."

00:16 Katina says to Evenia, "Ah. Tests then."

00:16 Cheri Lindbergh says, "And it has flavors."

00:16 Lily says to Cheri, "So we need for someone to sneak us in some of that bubbly tea!"

00:16 Lily Kaise grins.

00:16 Cheri says to Lily, "I wish."

00:16 Evenia says to Cheri, "I love the um...forgive me but I don't remember it's name. the bread though."

00:16 Cheri Lindbergh says, "But I'm talking only about the food."

00:16 Lily Kaise nods.

00:17 Lily Kaise says, "Well there are some of the meat-looking dishes which I wouldn't eat unless it was all there was."

00:17 Lily Kaise says, "Like that soup over on Roger's uh no."

00:17 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

00:17 Cheri Lindbergh says, "That's like the stew you have made all from leftovers."

00:18 Lily Kaise says, "Probably and it's practical."

00:18 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

00:18 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I just can't manage those orange things in that soup!"

00:18 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:18 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well maybe they're brown now."

00:18 Lily Kaise says, "Could be and that's even."

00:18 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Better!"

00:19 Lily Kaise chuckles at Cheri Lindbergh.

00:19 Evenia Callseah says, "I'd love to get hold of those coffee cubes. I swear I'd pay a fortune for a good supply of those."

00:19 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Oh hey, that gelatin?"

00:19 Evenia Callseah nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

00:19 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah, I liked that."

00:19 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I think they maybe had chai tea in a cube too."

00:19 Lily Kaise says, "Oh now that wouldn't be too bad."

00:20 Lily Kaise asks, "Where were those?"

00:20 Evenia Callseah says, "I haven't a clue how or where to get hold of it, but I'd pay a good pile of tael if that's what it took."

00:20 Cheri says to Lily, "It was from way spinward."

00:20 Lily Kaise says, "Oh ok."

00:20 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah Dolea?"

00:20 Evenia says to Cheri, "I shall send you on grand coffee cube hunting mission."

00:20 Lily Kaise says, "I never pronounce that correctly."

00:20 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Hey maybe that store on Tandem could get in some gelatin, some of the good stuff."

00:20 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Evenia Callseah.

00:21 Lily Kaise says, "What I really loved was the tea over on Xia He."

00:21 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I'm going to ask them."

00:21 "Maybe I could get in contact with the owner." Evenia Callseah nods to Cheri Lindbergh. "I'd happily trade or pay, whatever they wanted."

00:21 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Same."

00:21 Lily Kaise says, "They could make dispensers of their tea and make enough to keep Xia He rolling."

00:22 Evenia says to Cheri, "If you manage it, I'll split the cost with you."

00:22 Katina Faye picks up a sterile white einrophone's handset and dials a number.

00:22 Cheri says to Evenia, "Well I was thinking they could look into it as a business venture, not something we would have to support. Talking about selling it in that store."

00:23 Lily Kaise asks, "Do you just eat them or dunk them in water or which?"

00:23 "Well true." Evenia Callseah nods to Cheri Lindbergh. "But we should offer to at least...pay for their first supply to see if it sells. I'd think."

00:23 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:23 Katina Faye says, "Well, hello there."

00:23 Katina Faye glowers.

00:23 Cheri Lindbergh says, "But there was that station where they made the gelatin, and they had a big dispenser in a snack area with all kinds of gelatin in there."

00:23 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:23 Katina Faye asks, "Have you been cleaning the earwax from your ears?"

00:24 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:24 Katina Faye says, "It's okay."

00:24 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:24 Katina Faye says, "And yes."

00:24 Cheri Lindbergh says, "We were just talking about the fine gelatin we got out spinward."

00:24 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:24 Katina Faye says, "I should charge you."

00:24 Cheri Lindbergh says, "And maybe trying to get them to sell it at Tandem as a business venture."

00:24 Evenia Callseah says, "I'd love to get hold of that."

00:24 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:24 Katina Faye says, "No, it will charge me I think. I made the call."

00:24 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "I have a vending machine stocked with some of it on my ship."

00:25 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah, it's pretty good stuff."

00:25 Evenia says to Anfisa of Marzore, "Does it have the coffee, if you remember?"

00:25 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:25 Katina Faye says, "I thought you'd found your way to feng wo."

00:25 Anfisa the Wanderer sits down on a small metal chair.

00:25 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Coffee gelatin."

00:25 Evenia Callseah gasps.

00:25 Evenia Callseah says, "That's what I was saying to cheri I wanted to get hold of."

00:25 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

00:27 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:27 Katina Faye asks, "What else did you learn?"

00:27 Katina Faye rolls her eyes.

00:27 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "What was the problem!"

00:28 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:28 Katina Faye says, "It was starting to get that way, yes."

00:28 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a tube of nondescript tea.

00:28 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a tube of instant coffee.

00:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves in from the east.

00:28 Cheri says to Katina, "What was the problem?"

00:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

00:28 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys, "Hi."

00:28 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says to Cheri, "Allllo."

00:29 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:29 Katina Faye says, "If you don't want to worry anyone, then prepare them. So, it's your own fault if you're sulking."

00:29 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:29 Katina Faye says, "Ah."

00:29 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I don't know who to write."

00:29 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:29 Katina Faye asks, "How so?"

00:30 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Is Cassandra the controller of Tandem?"

00:30 Ather Jammoa nods.

00:30 Evenia Callseah grins at Cheri Lindbergh. "I can honestly say I haven't a clue."

00:30 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Then I'll write to her and see how to get this gelatin."

00:31 Evenia Callseah says, "She is on the hunt. I have faith in the Cheri."

00:31 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "You can write me a letter."

00:31 Cheri Lindbergh grins at Evenia Callseah.

00:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Should be easy if the Dolia folks are willing, since she is a woman. Negotiations will go much smoother."

00:31 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "I got other plans for you."

00:31 Cheri says to Ather, "It wasn't from Dolia."

00:31 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:31 Katina Faye says, "Oh, I wasn't aware of that."

00:31 Pierre-Louis says to Cheri, "Are they sexy plans?"

00:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, the one from what'stheirface."

00:31 Cheri Lindbergh says, "It was from Husani's, the handsome guy."

00:31 Ather Jammoa nods.

00:31 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I think was the name."

00:31 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Yes, Handsome Husani."

00:31 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:
Katina Faye says, "Not my org, we're okay as far as I know."

00:32 Ather Jammoa says, "The one that was supposed to be threatened. Yes, I remember."

00:32 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Anyway, yeah. I'll try this."

00:33 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

00:33 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I hope we get better results than that time I asked about a 9th fleet lounge."

00:33 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:33 Katina Faye says, "So recruit."

00:33 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Bars are just lounges that have actual booze."

00:33 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:34 Katina Faye says, "Yep."

00:35 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:35 Katina Faye asks, "And?"

00:35 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:35 Katina Faye says, "I didn't say that."

00:35 Katina smiles quietly to herself.

00:35 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:
Katina Faye says, "It did."

00:35 Pierre-Louis says to Cheri, "You must ask for one hundred percent possible quantum catapult."

00:35 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:35 Katina Faye says, "Very much was."

00:36 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys. "I'll suggest it for sure."

00:36 Evenia Callseah beams at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

00:36 Evenia Callseah takes a sip of a tube of instant coffee.

00:36 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:36 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:36 Katina Faye says, "Nice try though."

00:37 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Yes, is clear."

00:37 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:37 Katina Faye says, "I presume as much."

00:37 Pierre-Louis says to Cheri, "And then the rift engine, another one hundred percent possible invention to boost speed with power of something."

00:37 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:37 Katina Faye says, "Mm."

00:37 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

00:38 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:38 Katina Faye asks, "Of what?"

00:38 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:38 Katina Faye says, "Nah."

00:38 "And a new rift engine, sure!" Cheri Lindbergh nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

00:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Quantum rift engine."

00:39 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "Well, there is impeller..."

00:39 Evenia Callseah begins sitting back on the couch, one hand casually resting at the base of her throat, half on her chest.

00:39 Katina laughs quietly.

00:39 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:39 Katina Faye says, "So you have cleaned the earwax from your ears."

00:40 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:40 Katina Faye asks, "Why?"

00:40 Cheri Lindbergh pushes down a sterile white einrophone's plungers in the middle of Katina Faye's conversation.

00:40 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "Oops, damn. Sorry!"

00:41 Evenia Callseah smirks at Cheri Lindbergh.

00:41 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Or a curious Cheri!"

00:41 Lily Kaise grins at Cheri Lindbergh.

00:41 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "I want to do the SSN thing!"

00:41 Anfisa the Wanderer says, "We will never be able to talk to many people while ignoring world around us at this rate."

00:42 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Yeah, just one at a time."

00:42 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:42 Katina Faye says, "You will reimburse me."

00:42 Katina Faye speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

00:42 Katina Faye wanders west.

00:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Impeller and flowmill are spinny things. Maybe if you put some power on spinny things to make them spin ship would go faster."

00:44 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Also I think Katina might be angry now."

01:20 Nissi Valdaire rolls up a tube of sweetened dough-flavored nutrition paste from the end, squeezing out every last bit of the nutritious paste inside.

01:20 Kani Kahakai says, "The crispy bacon paste, how do you get paste to convey the quality of crispyness."

01:20 Nissi Valdaire forcefully hurls a flattened tube at a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.

01:20 It falls inside.

01:21 Kani Kahakai asks, "Or is it just a marketing ploy?"

01:21 Nissi Valdaire says, "Those are probably like a thousand calories each. I've had three tonight."

01:29 Aisling the Fox says, "At least they did not take Manx."

01:39 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh well."

01:40 Keegan Wantz says, "Well, maybe."

01:40 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "They cannot escape, only I can launch the ship."

01:40 Morris Corlew grins.

01:40 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah, that's what is likely keeping us here."

01:44 Keegan Wantz says, "INFINITE QUANTUM FOAM."

01:44 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

01:44 Aisling the Fox says, "Where is someone to talk to? This phone needs access to news."

01:45 Morris Corlew says, "That guy in the airlock maybe. Good luck though. He's just kinda brusque."

01:45 A synthesized voice announces, "A visitor has arrived."

01:50 You peer east...

01:50 
[EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Visitation Lobby]
At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all. Several chairs are arranged on both halves of the room, with a door on the opposite side of the barrier leading northwest to the station proper, while a door this side leads west to the main gathering area.
On the other side, you see Ninja the little black CatBot, a small Bari-shaped tidbit, Nicolette the little calico CatBot, and Fuzzball the average-sized onyx long-haired felo here.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn, Evenia Callseah, and Morris Corlew are here.
Sarah Bellamy, Lorenah Mayfield, Brunhilda Schreiber, Arielle Night, and Sean Sloan are on the other side.
You can go west.

01:50 Melinda Michaels says, "See I won't go wave at him again."

01:50 You blink heavily and then doze off.

01:50 Melinda Michaels grins.

01:50 Katina says to Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft, "Don't drule."

01:50 Melinda Michaels waves.

01:50 Evenia Callseah waves.

01:51 Evenia Callseah sits down on a huge comfy couch.

01:51 Evenia Callseah says, "That's almost worse. Seeing your pets and not being able to touch them. I also gave myself a fucking headache, because...I'm stupid."

01:51 Aisling the Fox prances in from the north.

01:51 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

01:51 Melinda says to Evenia, "How'd you get a headache?"

01:51 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I hope President Best will come visit us."

01:51 Aisling the Fox says, "I talked to man in biohazard suit, but he did not really respond much."

01:52 Aisling the Fox says, "We will see what happens."

01:52 Aisling the Fox sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

01:52 Lily Kaise says, "I hope he does too so I can slap him."

01:52 Aisling the Fox glances at Lily Kaise.

01:52 Aisling the Fox asks, "Why?"

01:52 Lily Kaise asks, "Why wouldn't I want to slap Best?"

01:52 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh."

01:52 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh."

01:52 Evenia says to Melinda, "Well...You can see through that barrier so easy, that when I saw ears...I forgot all about it and tossed myself at him. Turns out if you run into that thing at high speed, it hurts."

01:52 Aisling the Fox says, "I thought you were talking about man in biohazard suit."

01:53 Kani Kahakai says, "Best does not need additional head fungi."

01:53 Melinda says to Evenia, "Ow."

01:53 Lily Kaise says, "Oh of course I wouldn't slap the Tech up ahead... no no."

01:53 Evenia says to Melinda, "Tell me about it."

01:53 Evenia Callseah says, "Granted, it probably looked hilarious."

01:53 Katina Faye says, "It did not."

01:54 Lily Kaise nods to Aisling the Fox.

01:54 Katina Faye says, "Perhaps if you were laughing it would have. But I saw discomfort, so, it did not."

01:54 Evenia Callseah says, "I would have laughed at me. But I am a bitch, so..."

01:54 Keegan says to Evenia, "Headbutt the barrier, ahoy."

01:54 Katina says to Evenia, "Which one, bitch alpha, or bitch omega. I forgot."

01:54 Evenia Callseah laughs at Keegan Wantz. "Quiet you."

01:55 Evenia Callseah says, "Alpha, Mel is omega."

01:55 Kani Kahakai says, "Melinda is the end of all things."

01:56 Lily Kaise says, "Nap time for me."

01:56 Lily Kaise stands up from a small metal chair.

01:56 Lily Kaise waves.

02:02 Aisling the Fox says, "I am missing things and feel naked."

02:02 Katina says to Aisling, "Same."

02:02 Melinda Michaels says, "It'll be fine."

02:03 Evenia Callseah finishes off a tube of instant coffee.

02:04 Melinda Michaels grins.

02:05 Katina smiles, her warm hazel eyes sparkling with silent laughter.

02:06 Kani Kahakai finishes off a tube of fruit juice.

02:06 Evenia Callseah says, "Honestly though this could be far less comfortable. Yeah the gowns itch a bit and I don't have anything under it. Even paper underwear. And the food is...interesting. but hell. It's free."

02:06 Keegan Wantz stretches.

02:06 Keegan Wantz rolls up a tube of pizza-flavored nutrition paste from the end, squeezing out every last bit of the nutritious paste inside.

02:07 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

02:07 Melinda Michaels squeezes Kani Kahakai affectionately.

02:07 Evenia Callseah runs her fingers back and forth through Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft's hair.

02:07 Katina Faye says, "I just hope my gown does not tear."

02:07 Kani Kahakai forcefully hurls an empty tube at a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.

02:07 It falls inside.

02:07 Kani Kahakai says, "Boop."

02:07 Kani rests her head on Melinda's shoulder.

02:11 Evenia Callseah chuckles at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys. "Any paper underwear would be nice. This just...feels wrong."

02:12 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean. Even in prison you get panties. Though they do itch like hell."

02:12 Katina says to Evenia, "You've been to prison?"

02:12 "Yeah." Evenia Callseah looks at Katina Faye and shrugs. "There was an invasion and smart little me just ran out of the apartment...completely naked."

02:12 Katina Faye giggles.

02:13 Evenia Callseah says, "So...um, I didn't make it to crew."

02:13 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Alas, you lacked paper underwear at that time."

02:33 Katina Faye asks, "If it tastes like chicken, keep on licken?"

02:34 Kani Kahakai leans toward Melinda Michaels and softly licks her cheek.

02:34 Katina Faye says, "Eww."

02:34 Kani says to Melinda, "You do not taste like chicken."

02:34 Katina lets out a soft equable laugh.

02:35 Kani Kahakai unscrews the cap on a tube of roast chicken-flavored nutrition paste.

02:35 Kani Kahakai lifts a tube of roast chicken-flavored nutrition paste and squirts some paste into her mouth.

02:35 Kani Kahakai shrugs.

02:36 Pierre-Louis says to Katina, "Can I borrow your paper gown to make a fine hat?"

02:38 Katina says to Pierre-Louis, "Why? Your hair seems to be doing a fine job of that."

02:39 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Hair hat require hat."

02:39 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the east.

02:39 Morris Corlew sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

02:39 Katina says to Pierre-Louis, "Ask Eve, she does not seem comfortable with her paper gown."

02:39 Katina flashes an impish smile.

02:40 Morris Corlew smoothes down a white paper gown.

02:40 Katina says to Morris, "How do you like your dress?"

02:40 Morris says to Katina, "Can't wait to get my own clothes back."

02:41 Katina briefly turns her face to press against the beanbag and lets out a muffled giggle.

02:42 Ather Jammoa finishes off a tube of fruit juice.

02:42 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

02:42 Ather Jammoa strides west.

02:42 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

02:42 Ather Jammoa strides in from the west.

02:43 Katina says to Morris, "Pierre needs a paper gown to make a hat."

02:43 Morris says to Katina, "Give him yours?"

02:43 Katina gazes expectantly at Morris.

02:43 Morris says to Katina, "Ain't happenin."

02:43 Katina says to Morris, "Fine. Keep the dress."

02:43 Morris says to Katina, "Try one of the Damiens."

02:43 Morris Corlew grins.

02:44 Morris Corlew gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

02:48 Blake Madison walks in from the north.

02:48 Morris says to Blake Madison, "Yo."

02:48 Blake Madison exclaims, "Hello!"

02:48 Kani Kahakai works the nutritious paste around in her mouth, then thoughtfully swallows it.

02:49 Blake Madison walks south.

02:50 Blake Madison walks in from the south.

02:50 Katina removes her hand from under her head and gives Blake Madison a little wave, before tucking it back under her cheek.

02:50 Morris Corlew stretches.

02:50 Blake Madison waves back to Katina.

02:51 Blake Madison sits down on a huge comfy couch.

02:51 Katina says to Blake, "You look simply dashing in your dress."

02:51 Morris Corlew chuckles.

02:51 Katina shoots Blake a playful smile.

02:51 Blake says to Katina, "Well, thank you. I try."

02:52 Katina Faye says, "I am on edge, though I hide it well. I plan to keep mine from any tears while I'm here."

02:53 Katina carefully adjusts her paper gown.

02:53 Cheri Lindbergh looks at Katina Faye thoughtfully. "You don't hide it all that well, not the last couple of cycles."

02:53 Cheri Lindbergh finishes off a tube of nondescript tea.

02:54 Katina Faye looks at Cheri Lindbergh thoughtfully.

02:55 Evenia Callseah says, "It's been more obvious than bright orange hair on dark skin."

02:55 Cheri says to Katina, "You seemed restless even before we got here."

02:55 Katina says to Cheri, "The beanbag is helping."

02:55 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Hmm, beans."

02:56 Morris Corlew nods to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel for some reason. "Needs bean paste for Pierre."

02:56 A synthesized voice announces, "A visitor has arrived."

02:56 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles east.

02:56 Morris leans his head back and closes his eyes. "Only if it's Pais..."

02:56 Cheri Lindbergh stands up from a huge comfy couch.

02:56 Evenia leans forward, peering around the door. "Nope."

02:57 Cheri Lindbergh puts an empty tube in a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.

02:57 Morris Corlew says, "Mmph. Ah well."

02:57 Cheri Lindbergh steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

02:57 Katina gives Morris a gentle smile.

02:57 A vending machine of sterile white plasteel buzzes alarmingly at Cheri Lindbergh and emits a shower of sparks.

02:57 Cheri says to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel, "Oh shush."

02:57 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "This does sucks significantly more than rifting about, at least you find rocks sometimes."

02:57 Cheri Lindbergh says, "And there's things to watch."

02:58 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:00 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, I gotta say, I'd rather be becalmed."

03:01 Evenia Callseah nods. "Same here."

03:01 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Only rift engine will save us from becalming."

03:01 Evenia Callseah says, "I swear I'd pay 5 million a cup for decent coffee though."

03:02 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "How long do you think it'll take them to clear us?"

03:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "A grand cycle."

03:02 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Daaang."

03:02 Morris Corlew says, "Not sure if we still got sleepers on the ship or anythin."

03:02 Evenia Callseah says, "I guess it could be a couple of days. I mean they gotta test all those samples, maybe take more from us yet."

03:03 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I think there's everybody from the Cartes in here."

03:03 Morris Corlew asks, "Erik?"

03:03 Evenia Callseah says, "Wouldn't surprise me if Gonz is still on the ship."

03:03 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Oh yeah, there's one."

03:03 Evenia Callseah says, "Constantine, um..."

03:03 Morris Corlew says, "Far's I know, Erik, Gonz, Constantine, Ryan, and Clarina."

03:03 Aisling the Fox flicks Ather Jammoa on the shoulder.

03:03 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well then we definitely have to wait for everybody to get off the ships, unless they haul them off bodily."

03:04 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

03:04 Evenia Callseah says, "I would if I was them. But I find yanking people out of bed amusing, so..."

03:04 Morris Corlew grins.

03:05 Aisling the Fox says, "I will admit that is what I expected."

03:05 Aisling the Fox says, "To wake up here in shitty paper gown."

03:05 Evenia Callseah says, "Like the time Johann wouldn't get up, I just flipped the hammock. He didn't have much choice in the matter then."

03:05 Morris Corlew grins.

03:05 Aisling the Fox asks, "Could we not even have colors?"
Katina says to Evenia, "Did he land on a pile of felo?"

03:06 Evenia Callseah says, "Nope. On his butt. Kinda in a pile."

03:06 Morris Corlew grins.

03:06 Morris says to Aisling, "Orange?"

03:06 Aisling the Fox says, "Of course."

03:06 Morris Corlew gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

03:06 Aisling the Fox says, "A deck of cards would be nice too."

03:06 Cheri shows Aisling the pink lotus tattoo on her hand.

03:06 Morris Corlew nods.

03:06 Aisling the Fox says, "That its pretty."

03:07 Cheri says to Aisling, "Thanks."

03:07 Morris Corlew says, "I want cobalt blue."

03:07 Morris Corlew considers a white paper gown thoughtfully.

03:07 Evenia Callseah nods and nods.

03:07 Evenia Callseah says, "Or indigo, but that goes without saying."

03:07 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I think it was from Xia He."

03:07 Morris Corlew says, "Ruby red."

03:07 Aisling the Fox asks, "Where you got it?"

03:07 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:07 Aisling the Fox nods.

03:08 Aisling the Fox says, "Neat."

03:08 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "You know that little shop?"

03:08 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not know if I have been to Xia He."

03:08 Katina Faye says, "It is a wonderful place."

03:08 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Where the monks are?"

03:08 Aisling the Fox nods.

03:08 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Sort of near the floating buddha."

03:08 Aisling the Fox says, "I have not seen."

03:08 Evenia Callseah says, "I will go, someday. I know I'll love it."

03:08 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, it's just beautiful."

03:09 Morris Corlew says, "It's a very peaceful and beautiful place."

03:09 Aisling the Fox says, "It sounds very interesting."

03:09 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:09 Aisling the Fox says, "But honestly I would prefer doing this sort of thing than go to places already known, even if they are pretty."

03:09 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:10 Kani Kahakai squirts some more paste from a tube of roast chicken-flavored nutrition paste into her mouth.

03:10 Ather Jammoa drops an empty tube.

03:10 As soon as an empty tube hits the ground, it suddenly shatters into a billion pieces, never to be seen again.

03:10 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I don't know if I do or not, I can't decide."

03:10 Aisling the Fox grins.

03:10 Katina Faye says, "My favorite tapestry there is the one with the grand mister in robes and finery. He was holding up a sword in one hand and a lotus in the other. If memory serves me right."

03:11 Aisling the Fox says, "I found this all to be very exciting, even if I was extremely paranoid something bad was going to happen on way back."

03:11 Morris Corlew says, "I enjoy goin places I never been...but I enjoy the thrill of goin places that're totally new."

03:11 Cheri says to Aisling, "I liked helping out on this trip, but I wouldn't want to be in charge of it."

03:11 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Like what if you tell people to get the hell out of there just a little too late?"

03:11 Morris Corlew says, "Even more I mean."

03:12 Evenia Callseah says, "Next time though. The crew of the other ship can have the...whoever gets infected with whatever on their ship. That was like. double extra stress."

03:12 Morris Corlew says, "Aww."

03:12 Cheri says to Morris, "What's the difference between you never being there and the places being totally new? You mean like a newly formed planet?"

03:12 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "It was okay until he tried turning ship back."

03:12 Evenia Callseah nods to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys. "Right."

03:13 Morris says to Cheri, "No like...that no human's ever been to."

03:13 Evenia Callseah says, "Before that I was cool, after that..."

03:13 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Morris Corlew.

03:13 Morris says to Cheri, "Someplace that's familiar to other folks but new to me has a certain thrill...but the thrill of somplace no other human till then's ever been is an even bigger thrill."

03:13 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I was cool with it until I realized nobody was in the ship and I felt like a complete dumbass. It was stupid."

03:14 Aisling the Fox says, "I do like to think I have a good sense of impending doom. I was already backing away from sphere when Jim told us to run."

03:14 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Who said we could all come out there?"

03:14 Morris Corlew says, "I uh...got too much curiosity."

03:14 Aisling says to Cheri, "Sphere told us."

03:14 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "I remember Ellen said something, then Ather, then Pierre. But who gave the first permission?"

03:14 Evenia Callseah says, "It kinda had me a little...transfixed. and then the outsider. and I basically felt like my feet were glued there."

03:14 Aisling the Fox says, "Well. Through its people things."

03:15 Aisling the Fox says, "I believe Jim gave approval."

03:15 Morris Corlew asks, "I think Jim mighta been the one to call everybody else outta the ships?"

03:15 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:15 Katina sits up on her beanbag and runs her fingers through her slightly tousled hair.

03:15 Katina Faye stops resting quietly on a shapeless beanbag, her body comfortably curled up on itself.

03:15 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I didn't hear that part because I was still in the ship."

03:15 Katina Faye sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

03:15 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

03:15 Morris Corlew says, "Some of us had our spacesuits on, listenin in through the radio."

03:15 Cheri Lindbergh says, "It's just wow, curiosity was too strong and I forgot everything else. I hated realizing it."

03:15 Morris Corlew nods.

03:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Overtaken by the mushrooms."

03:16 Morris Corlew grins.

03:16 Morris Corlew wriggles his fingers.

03:16 Evenia Callseah shudders.

03:16 Katina says to Pierre-Louis, "Sporific."

03:17 Evenia Callseah says, "You know how sometimes you have the most...pointless thoughts at the wrong times? When I saw that outsider, all I could think was, "Thank fuck I don't have tentacles, thank fuck I don't have tentacles.""

03:17 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:18 Aisling the Fox says, "By the time Outsider came in I had a good idea what was going on."

03:18 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I feel like somebody should have just said no, we have to see if the environment is good or something like that."

03:18 Evenia Callseah says, "So if I ever. Talk about getting tentacles again. Someone remind me of when I was staring at an outsider. Realizing how fucking glad I was I didn't do it."

03:18 Morris Corlew says, "I uh...wanted to say yes."

03:18 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

03:19 Katina says to Morris, "If Pierre said to remove all coverings, would you say yes?"

03:19 Katina Faye smirks at Morris Corlew.

03:19 Morris says to Katina, "No. Pierre ain't no alien."

03:19 Katina says to Morris, "I see."

03:19 Evenia Callseah says, "Pierre is not the sphere though. The sphere. It's suggestions. It's words..."

03:19 Aisling the Fox asks, "So you would trust unknown alien creature more than Pierre?"

03:19 Morris Corlew grins. "I mean...he's alien...he just ain't -an- alien."

03:19 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:19 Morris Corlew says, "It ain't bout trust."

03:19 Morris Corlew says, "It's bout curiosity."

03:20 Evenia Callseah says, "It...wasn't trust."

03:20 Evenia Callseah nods.

03:20 Aisling the Fox says, "I am guessing you do not use condoms much."

03:20 Morris Corlew says, "I still would love to be able to talk to Georgie. Find out what this experience has actually felt like...been like for him."

03:20 Evenia Callseah says, "But in a way...I feel like I was also tempted to think that way. by the sphere. I'm naturally curious. but I'm not stupid. So...The fact that I wanted to do it. tells me there was more going on."

03:20 Katina says to Aisling, "Whuh?"

03:21 Morris Corlew says, "And no. It's not about trust. I never trusted that thing. But curiosity was higher'n trust. And caution was higher'n curiosity."

03:21 Morris says to Evenia, "The fact you didn't do it..."

03:21 Ather Jammoa shakes his head.

03:21 Aisling says to Katina, "He was ready to remove everything for curiosity sake. Was joke."

03:21 Cheri Lindbergh says, "It wasn't the sphere that made me want to go out there."

03:21 Katina says to Aisling, "Oh."

03:22 Morris says to Aisling, "Little need."

03:22 Morris Corlew gestures vaguely.

03:22 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the east.

03:22 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn ambles south.

03:22 Katina Faye glances at Morris Corlew and rolls her eyes. "Let her have her fun."

03:22 Morris says to Katina, "Oh I am."

03:22 Morris Corlew grins.

03:23 Morris says to Katina, "She can make of that what she will."

03:23 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:23 Katina shrugs in nonchalance.

03:23 Ather Jammoa strides north.

03:23 Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.

03:24 Ather Jammoa says, "Bah, he still won't let us out."

03:24 Ather Jammoa sits down on a huge comfy couch.

03:24 Morris Corlew says, "They ain't got everybody in here yet."

03:24 Evenia Callseah says, "We need to get those last 4 in here I think. Who knows how long that's gonna take."

03:24 Katina Faye stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

03:24 Katina Faye stretches.

03:24 Katina Faye wanders east.

03:25 Ather says to Pierre-Louis, "Should've just booted the ship."

03:25 Katina Faye wanders in from the east.

03:25 Katina Faye wanders west.

03:25 Katina Faye wanders in from the west.

03:25 Katina Faye wanders east.

03:25 Ather Jammoa says, "Not like it'd make a difference if they were sleeping naked."

03:25 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:25 Aisling the Fox says, "Oh."

03:25 Aisling the Fox stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

03:25 Aisling the Fox prances west.

03:25 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:25 Evenia Callseah shrugs. "They still would have actually had to walk in...though. I was still figuring out how to open my eyes and Johann guided me in. so..."

03:25 Aisling the Fox prances in from the west.

03:25 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

03:25 Aisling the Fox says, "Well shite."

03:25 Aisling the Fox sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

03:25 Katina Faye wanders in from the east.

03:25 Aisling the Fox says, "No mail for me."

03:25 Katina Faye sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

03:25 Ather says to Evenia, "Maybe, sure. At least though they would've been more readily accessible."

03:26 Morris Corlew says, "I had insurance and a letter from Kert's all."

03:26 Evenia Callseah nods to Ather Jammoa. "Right."

03:26 Morris Corlew says, "Got three packages, only one I know what it is. The other two're probably payback from Eve."

03:26 Evenia Callseah says, "I mean I was like, over three quarters asleep when johann helped me in here. I hardly even noticed all the pinching poking and prodding. I just wanted coffee."

03:27 Morris Corlew stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

03:27 Morris Corlew steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

03:27 Morris Corlew taps a button on a vending machine of sterile white plasteel and receives a tube of fruit juice.

03:27 Morris Corlew sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

03:27 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

03:27 I see no "lily" here.

03:28 Evenia Callseah says, "Actually not yet. I need to find the perfect payback for that. That was evil."

03:28 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:28 Morris Corlew says, "Blame Wendy."

03:28 Evenia Callseah says, "That's too easy."

03:28 Morris Corlew absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

03:28 Aisling the Fox asks, "I understand need to keep us from physically contact others who were not on trip, but why can we not have communicators?"

03:29 Cheri says to Aisling, "I sure wouldn't mind my communicator."

03:29 Morris Corlew says, "Same."

03:29 Evenia Callseah says, "Even horrible white ones to go with our gowns."

03:29 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.

03:29 Cheri Lindbergh grins. "Yeah."

03:29 Katina Faye says, "I miss my phone."

03:29 Ather Jammoa says, "I'd rather have my phone. Fuck the comm chatter."

03:30 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I kinda like the comm chatter."

03:30 Morris says to Katina, "One day you'll have a phone grow out the side of your head."

03:30 Morris Corlew grins.

03:30 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Mostly."

03:30 Morris Corlew nods to Cheri Lindbergh.

03:30 Morris Corlew says, "Me too, mostly."

03:30 Katina says to Morris, "Okay."

03:30 Morris Corlew chuckles.

03:30 Aisling the Fox says, "Yes, right. Keep us from going around and fucking those not in contact with spores. But why not let us talk on comms? We can talk to visitors. Seems stupid."

03:30 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

03:30 Morris Corlew says, "Would love to have my phone for the newsreader."

03:31 Evenia Callseah says, "Because I totally understand the need for us to not have physical contact, but...Let us have something. yes we've got that phone here, but it's not exactly...private. some contact with the worlds out there would be nice."

03:31 Aisling leans back on her beanbag chair and flails her arms haplessly.

03:31 Morris Corlew says, "At least let me find a number for TBX and just pretend to cry like a baby."

03:32 Evenia Callseah says, "Or fuck. Send through some strippers. Or...fuck. entertainment."

03:32 Katina Faye stares at Evenia Callseah.

03:32 Morris Corlew grins.

03:32 Evenia Callseah says, "Something."

03:32 Aisling the Fox asks, "Was there new political news on holovid?"

03:32 Morris Corlew says, "We got the moss channel."

03:33 Morris says to Aisling, "Nothin since we left, no."

03:33 Evenia Callseah says, "Uh to be clear. I wasn't suggesting fucking. That didn't come out right."

03:33 Morris Corlew laughs.

03:33 Aisling the Fox says, "Please go to private area to commence in fuckery."

03:33 Evenia Callseah laughs.

03:34 Morris Corlew says, "Uh...private area."

03:34 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

03:34 Morris Corlew says, "Right..."

03:34 Morris Corlew says, "I mean...there's the...facilities."

03:34 Evenia Callseah says, "I can't honestly think of anything more of a turn off than all this...white."

03:34 I see no "lily" here.

03:34 Morris Corlew grins.

03:34 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:34 Evenia Callseah says, "Okay, so maybe a mushroom on someone's forehead might top it."

03:34 Morris Corlew grins.

03:34 Aisling rolls her eyes at Morris and jerks her hand spasmodically at him.

03:35 Morris Corlew stares at Aisling the Fox.

03:35 Evenia Callseah giggles at Aisling the Fox.

03:35 Morris Corlew says, "Ruuuude."

03:35 Morris Corlew grins.

03:35 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

03:36 Kani Kahakai slumps on a huge comfy couch and goes to sleep.

03:36 Evenia Callseah says, "I'd um. Maybe have liked...A uh. a paper scarf. something. This is a touch...uncomfortable. I thought about just ripping a length off the bottom of the gown. but..."

03:37 Morris Corlew says, "It'd be super short then."

03:37 Aisling the Fox says, "If we combine all of our gowns together we would have a lot of paper."

03:37 Morris Corlew grins.

03:37 Evenia Callseah nods. "It would be, but my discomfort would certainly go far far down."

03:37 Morris says to Evenia, "I dunno...origami some blank letters from the mail room together."

03:38 Evenia Callseah chuckles. "Hey, that could work."

03:38 I see no "lily" here.

03:39 Morris Corlew says, "Necessity is the mother of invention."

03:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "This is very exciting."

03:41 Evenia Callseah stands up from a huge comfy couch.

03:41 Evenia Callseah shuffles south.

03:41 Aisling the Fox asks, "I am assuming others read headlines prior to disembarking ships?"

03:41 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I did."

03:41 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:41 Morris Corlew says, "Read 'em right as we got in comms."

03:42 Aisling the Fox says, "I am surprised by Fringe response."

03:42 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox. "Me too."

03:42 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Strongly worded words."

03:42 Morris Corlew says, "Pleasantly so."

03:43 Aisling the Fox says, "Well, going from buying into Iron Turkey to possibly kicking out diplomates is big jump in relationship status."

03:43 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

03:43 Morris Corlew asks, "Guess it ticked 'em off that much. Wonder how long it'll take fore they settle down and go well...long as y'all don't do xyz...we're still cool, right?"

03:46 Evenia Callseah shuffles in from the south.

03:46 Evenia Callseah sits down on a huge comfy couch.

03:46 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

03:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Much nothings will be done."

03:47 Morris Corlew says, "Probably."

03:47 Lily Kaise walks in from the south.

03:47 You beam at Lily Kaise.

03:47 Morris Corlew says, "But it's a different reaction from what I expected outta 'em. And...that's a good thing."

03:47 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

03:47 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:48 Lily Kaise sits down beside shule.

03:48 Lily Kaise sits down on a small metal chair.

03:48 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Then Ather can join feng Woo Collective."

03:48 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:48 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:48 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:48 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:49 Katina Faye stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

03:49 Katina Faye wanders east.

03:50 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

03:50 Katina Faye wanders in from the east.

03:51 Blake says to Katina Faye, "Welcome back."

03:51 Katina Faye nods softly to Blake.

03:51 Morris quietly twiddles his thumbs.

03:52 You wave to Katina Faye.

03:52 Katina Faye says, "Urr."

03:52 Katina Faye blushes.

03:52 Lily Kaise waves to Katina Faye.

03:52 Katina Faye says, "I just left for a moment."

03:52 Aisling the Fox says, "I am very glad I went to Doc last time instead of here."

03:52 Katina Faye says, "Anyways, I wonder if Ari plans to camp out here tonight."

03:52 Morris says to Katina, "Dunno."

03:53 Katina shrugs in nonchalance.

03:53 Morris Corlew says, "She uh...kinda seemed a lil..."

03:53 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

03:53 Morris Corlew shrugs helplessly.

03:53 Morris Corlew says, "Taken aback when somebody called her a cunt."

03:54 Katina says to Morris, "Whuh?"

03:54 Blake Madison glances at Morris Corlew.

03:54 Blake Madison says, "What."

03:54 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "Who?"

03:54 Kani Kahakai suddenly awakens.

03:55 Kani Kahakai rolls up a tube of roast chicken-flavored nutrition paste from the end, squeezing out every last bit of the nutritious paste inside.

03:55 Kani Kahakai forcefully hurls a flattened tube at a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.

03:55 It falls inside.

03:55 Kani Kahakai stretches.

03:55 Morris Corlew says, "She uh...was bein kinda rude bout Brunhilda. Hawthorn said somethin bout how she shouldn't get up on her high horse and be a cunt or somethin."

03:55 Morris Corlew takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

03:55 Katina smiles warmly at Kani.

03:55 Cheri Lindbergh asks, "What did Brunhilda do?"

03:55 Lily Kaise says, "Well that's kind of crude but yeah."

03:55 Morris Corlew says, "Nothin. Ari was apparently kinda grossed out."

03:55 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:55 Morris Corlew says, "Waited till Brunhilda left and was bein a jerk."

03:56 Lily Kaise says, "That's Hawthorn for you though."

03:56 Morris Corlew says, "Tried to explain to her...how...would she act like that to a kid...tryin to I guess elicit some sympathy. Hawthorn took offense to that too."

03:56 Morris Corlew says, "Ah well."

03:56 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, she is gross-looking, don't get mad at me, but she is physically ugly, except maybe to another such-looking person."

03:56 Ather Jammoa says, "She is fucking ugly. There's no real way around it."

03:56 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

03:57 Morris Corlew says, "Yeah...but she intentionally waited till Brunhilda left the room and then started makin comments."

03:57 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah but is that her fault?"

03:57 Aisling the Fox says, "Yes. I have little sympathy for her doing that to herself."

03:57 Ather Jammoa says, "Yes, actually."

03:57 Katina Faye says, "Yes it is."

03:57 Morris Corlew says, "It is actually."

03:57 Lily Kaise says, "Oh ok."

03:57 Kani Kahakai says, "It pretty much is her fault."

03:57 Ather Jammoa says, "There is no pretty much. It definitely is her fault."

03:57 Evenia Callseah says, "Sure, but it's still not okay for people to be rude about it. At least behind her back. Say it to the woman's face."

03:57 Cheri Lindbergh says, "So would it be better if she just said Hey Brunhilda, you ugly."

03:57 Morris Corlew says, "But if you're gonna be a jerk to somebody, do it to their face instead of just behind their back."

03:57 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that is my point."

03:57 Ather Jammoa says, "I'm rude about it and do say it to her face."

03:57 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

03:57 Lily Kaise says, "Right."

03:57 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Evenia Callseah. "That's what I meant."

03:57 You nod.

03:58 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "She did drink the vial, but there was a slight chance to have an effect that would have looked good."

03:58 Kani Kahakai says, "Her request was that people not treat her any different than before."

03:58 Kani Kahakai says, "So I have kept ignoring her mostly."

03:58 Morris Corlew says, "That's what I told Ari."

03:58 Morris Corlew shrugs.

03:58 Morris Corlew nods to Kani Kahakai.

03:58 Aisling the Fox says, "Ehhh."

03:58 Kani Kahakai says, "She was pretty clear about not wanting people around her when I first met her."

03:58 Evenia Callseah says, "The thing is. It made her happy to do it. If it made my friend happy to get 6 arms and 4 heads. I support that friend."

03:58 Ather nods at Aisling in agreement.

03:58 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well, she's who she is, what are you going to do? It's her fate not ours."

03:58 Morris Corlew says, "Anyway, he shouldn'ta called her a cunt, but he did have a point. She was bein a jerk."

03:59 Lily Kaise nods.

03:59 Evenia Callseah says, "It's...not that she doesn't want people around."

03:59 Aisling the Fox says, "When you go off and do something fucking stupid that makes you puke bile up everywhere, I do not think you are in position to demand everyone "treat you like before.""

03:59 Ather Jammoa grins at Aisling the Fox.

03:59 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that was her choice and she has to live with it."

03:59 Morris glances at Evenia out of the corner of his eye.

03:59 Morris Corlew shrugs.

04:00 You nod.

04:00 Evenia Callseah says, "She does that, because it's like...It's her wall. She shows people that fuck off side. But it's so that people don't get close to her."

04:00 Morris Corlew says, "Sometimes there's other issues too. I just...think it was kinda rude of her. She's like that a lot though."

04:00 Ather Jammoa says, "There are other ways of projecting an aura of "fuck off". Look at me, I have no friends."

04:00 Ather Jammoa says, "And it works."

04:01 Aisling the Fox looks at Ather Jammoa thoughtfully.

04:01 Aisling the Fox says, "That is a lie."

04:01 Ather says to Aisling, "You're the pesky sister."

04:01 Evenia Callseah says, "Becoming Brunhilda's friend was...A battle. But I saw that front for what it was, so I worked at it."

04:01 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "Ather is not your friend."

04:01 Aisling the Fox asks, "And Pierre?"

04:01 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Pierre is my pal!"

04:01 Ather Jammoa says, "Not my friend."

04:01 Aisling the Fox says, "Pal is friend."

04:01 Ather says to Aisling, "Prove it."

04:01 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "It is!"

04:01 Evenia Callseah shrugs. "I'm just saying she's more than you first see."

04:01 Aisling the Fox says, "Well I do not exactly have dictionary with me at the moment."

04:02 Kani Kahakai says, "Ather is a cold, unfeeling machine."

04:02 Ather says to Aisling, "I know. That's why you can't prove it."

04:02 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

04:02 Aisling says to Evenia, "She and I used to be friends. I liked her. But she became mean and distant."

04:02 Cheri says to Evenia, "I actually liked her before, but I'm so shallow it's just too hard to talk to her now."

04:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Hard times."

04:02 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "I didn't mind if she was mean and distant!"

04:03 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I'm limited in accepting things."

04:03 Evenia Callseah says, "What mostly kicked the off, was her galleon."

04:03 Aisling the Fox says, "Something in her changed before she literally changed."

04:03 Kani Kahakai says, "Some people don't like bugs or crawly things, or ants if you're Morris."

04:03 Evenia Callseah coughs. "That."

04:03 Kani Kahakai says, "I don't like body horror, squicks me out."

04:03 Morris Corlew nods to Aisling the Fox.

04:03 Kani Kahakai shudders.

04:03 Morris Corlew smirks at Kani Kahakai.

04:03 Katina Faye says, "I hate cockroaches."

04:03 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I will try best not to drink weird vials."

04:03 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I don't like brain-eating amoebas."

04:04 Kani Kahakai says, "Brain fungus bad."

04:04 Evenia gives Morris a small glance out of the corner of her eye.

04:04 Cheri says to Evenia, "So did this change her even more in her personality and such?"

04:04 Morris Corlew says, "I just don't think it's productive for everybody to act horrified and talk behind her back and whatnot. I dunno. I guess for me it was just another example of Ari bein Ari. And Hawthorn seemed to get her attention."

04:04 Evenia Callseah says, "Anyway, tell it to her face is mostly my point. She's a big girl."

04:05 Morris Corlew nods to Evenia Callseah.

04:05 Ather Jammoa says, "She did actually use to be decent peoples, but like others, the change really shifted my opinion of her."

04:05 You nod to Evenia Callseah.

04:05 Lily Kaise nods to Evenia Callseah.

04:05 Morris Corlew says, "She acted the same before she did it. How she acts ain't changed."

04:05 Ather Jammoa says, "But now she looks ugly."

04:05 Ather Jammoa says, "And pukes weird liquids."

04:05 Morris Corlew says, "She looks like how she's been actin."

04:06 Lily Kaise says, "I would honestly be afraid to come into contact with what she vomits too."

04:06 Katina cringes.

04:06 Lily Kaise nods.

04:06 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I didn't see it a lot, but I don't think she gets it on anybody."

04:06 Evenia says to Cheri, "Not really. But she was getting gradually more...distant since her galleon. I was about 90% sure she was gonna retire after it. but she didn't."

04:06 Morris Corlew says, "It does gross me out. But...reactin I think'll end up doin more harm."

04:06 Lily Kaise says, "It's sad actually though very sad."

04:06 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:06 A synthesized voice announces, "A visitor has arrived."

04:06 Katina Faye says, "She was nice to me."

04:06 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

04:06 Morris Corlew taps Aisling the Fox.

04:06 Ather Jammoa says, "It's jason."

04:06 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Woo."

04:07 Morris Corlew gives an excited double thumbs up!

04:07 Ather Jammoa stands up from a huge comfy couch.

04:07 Ather Jammoa pulls Aisling the Fox to her feet.

04:07 Ather Jammoa takes Aisling the Fox into his group.
Ather Jammoa's group strides east.
Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:07 Ather Jammoa strides in from the east.

04:07 Ather Jammoa sits down on a huge comfy couch.

04:07 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:07 Morris Corlew says, "Oh. I didn't even notice Manx."

04:07 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

04:07 Morris Corlew says, "Aaaah."

04:07 Morris Corlew says, "She was too late."

04:07 Aisling the Fox prances in from the east.

04:07 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:07 Aisling the Fox says, "He left."

04:07 Morris Corlew says, "Too late."

04:07 Ather Jammoa pats Aisling the Fox on the back.

04:07 Morris Corlew asks, "Call him?"

04:07 Morris Corlew nods to a sterile white einrophone for some reason.

04:07 Cheri Lindbergh says, "Well there are worse people."

04:07 Lily Kaise says, "Aww."

04:08 Aisling the Fox says, "I do not know his number."

04:08 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:08 Ather Jammoa says, "Stand by."

04:08 Morris Corlew stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

04:08 Katina Faye says, "Send him letter."

04:08 Morris Corlew picks up a sterile white einrophone's handset and dials a number.

04:08 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "He was not very patient."

04:08 Aisling the Fox says, "It is fine."

04:08 Aisling the Fox prances east.

04:08 Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:08 Morris Corlew picks up a sterile white einrophone's handset and dials a number.

04:08 Evenia Callseah says, "If I'd known they weren't gonna take out my piercings, I could have saved myself like a half hour of carefully taking things out."

04:08 Morris Corlew speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

04:08 Morris Corlew says, "Jason. You barely missed her."

04:08 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys chuckles.

04:08 Morris Corlew speaks into a sterile white einrophone:

04:08 Morris Corlew says, "Alright."

04:08 Katina Faye says, "I miss my locket."

04:09 Morris Corlew places a sterile white einrophone's handset back in its cradle.

04:09 Morris Corlew sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

04:09 Katina Faye says, "It feels so strange without it."

04:09 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:09 Morris says to Katina, "Got the -."

04:09 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah I still have my ear studs in."

04:09 Katina Faye raises an eyebrow at Morris Corlew.

04:09 Morris says to Katina, "You'll get it back soon I mean."

04:09 Evenia Callseah says, "And I still have my...well, other piercings."

04:09 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:09 Ather Jammoa says, "I miss my stun cannon."

04:09 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft beams at Evenia Callseah.

04:09 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:10 Johann says to Evenia, "I like your... other piercings."

04:10 Evenia slides in closer to Johann, cuddling up.

04:10 Lily Kaise says, "At least they were careful to put our other things in a separate box."

04:10 Evenia playfully slaps Johann.

04:10 Ather Jammoa says, "I should've given it to Clinker then tried to sneak him in with the bounty of goods he has stowed in his compartments."

04:10 Evenia says to Johann, "Perv."

04:10 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:10 Johann says to Evenia, "Yes."

04:10 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I was tempted."

04:10 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft snuggles up to Evenia Callseah's shoulder.

04:10 Morris Corlew grins.

04:10 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I was thinking about sneaking in some lager."

04:11 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:11 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "I wanted to sneak in a vibro baton."

04:11 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I was just going to put everything in Magellan and bring him right on in!"

04:11 Morris twirls an invisible vibro-baton.

04:11 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:11 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

04:11 Lily Kaise says, "Including a nice decanter of wine! And things."

04:11 Cheri Lindbergh steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

04:11 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:11 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:11 Cheri Lindbergh mashes a button on a vending machine of sterile white plasteel and receives a tube of nondescript tea.

04:11 Morris Corlew finishes off a tube of fruit juice.

04:11 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a tube of nondescript tea.

04:12 Cheri Lindbergh sits down on a huge comfy couch.

04:12 Morris Corlew forcefully hurls an empty tube at a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.
It falls inside.

04:12 Lily Kaise says, "I haven't had wine for perhaps three nights and of course i'd love a glass right now."

04:12 Cheri says to Evenia, "You think Brunhilda would mind if I asked her about t-shirts?"

04:12 Evenia says to Johann, "Just for that, you won't see them for a while."

04:12 Katina Faye steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

04:12 Evenia says to Cheri, "Nah, not at all."

04:12 You nod to Lily Kaise.

04:12 Katina Faye taps a button on a vending machine of sterile white plasteel and receives a tube of water.

04:12 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft pouts at Evenia Callseah.

04:12 Katina Faye takes a sip of a tube of water.

04:12 Ather Jammoa steps up to a vending machine of sterile white plasteel.

04:12 Ather Jammoa mashes a button on a vending machine of sterile white plasteel and receives a tube of fruit juice.

04:12 Cheri says to Evenia, "I'm going to do a thing."

04:12 Pierre-Louis says to Evenia, "Can I see them for a while?"

04:12 Ather Jammoa takes a sip of a tube of fruit juice.

04:13 Lily Kaise asks, "So did the rest of the crew finally show up?"

04:13 Katina Faye takes a sip of a tube of water.

04:13 Katina Faye takes a sip of a tube of water.

04:13 Evenia Callseah laughs at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys. "Totally. When you're dreaming."

04:13 Katina Faye takes a sip of a tube of water.

04:13 Morris Corlew asks, "Still missin the same...five?"

04:13 Pierre-Louis says to Cheri, "Is gonna be letter? Everyone love the letters."

04:13 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "It'll be fan club shirts."

04:13 Katina Faye finishes off a tube of water.

04:13 Lily Kaise says, "Damn which means we'll likely have to wait until they're here and tested and all that."

04:13 Pierre-Louis says to Cheri, "What are fan of?"

04:13 Katina Faye forcefully hurls an empty tube at a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.

04:13 It falls inside.

04:13 You nod.

04:14 Cheri says to Pierre-Louis, "Mister Kelsey!"

04:14 "She'll do it." Evenia Callseah grins at Cheri Lindbergh. "As long as you give her a clear design idea and whatnot. Or what you want on it."

04:14 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

04:15 Evenia Callseah says, "If only someone outside here had a key to the carts. They could kick them all off, and maybe give 'em one huge shove through the door."

04:15 Lily Kaise nods.

04:15 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "I send a lot of keys to the team, some EAOS person probably has one."

04:16 Evenia Callseah asks, "Aren't they all in quarantine though?"

04:16 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah, they're all likely in their private luxury hospital suite loving life with the exception of poor Georgie."

04:17 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:17 Evenia Callseah says, "If not, you should totally make a call and see if we can't get them in here. I mean...Erik hardly showed his face at all on the trip, he was in quarters most of the time, so we could be waiting a week."

04:18 Evenia Callseah says, "And I gotta tell ya. I'll be a serious bitch if I gotta spend a week in here without...well. I mentioned it earlier."

04:18 Morris stage whispers, "Coffee."

04:18 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Fold your paper gown into underwear."

04:18 Evenia Callseah nods and nods.

04:18 Evenia Callseah says, "That."

04:18 "Can she borrow yours?" Morris Corlew grins.

04:18 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:18 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft wraps his arms around Evenia Callseah, pulling her close.

04:18 Morris Corlew stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

04:18 Morris Corlew shuffles north.

04:18 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the north.

04:18 Morris Corlew shuffles west.

04:18 Lily puts her hand over her mouth and stifals a laugh.

04:18 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the west.

04:19 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:19 Morris folds a letter clumsily coming up with a slightly off-kilter triangle.

04:19 Evenia Callseah laughs.

04:19 Lily Kaise chuckles.

04:19 Melinda Michaels glances at Morris Corlew.

04:19 Morris holds up a letter.

04:19 You chuckle.

04:19 Lily Kaise asks, "Airplane?"

04:19 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft asks, "Where's aisling?"

04:19 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft scrambles to his feet.

04:19 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft meanders east.

04:19 Morris rips the edge of a letter, then stops.

04:19 Morris Corlew says, "Huh."

04:19 Morris Corlew says, "This ain't gonna work."

04:19 Lily Kaise smirks at Morris Corlew.

04:19 Morris Corlew sighs.

04:19 Evenia Callseah giggles.

04:19 Morris Corlew crumples up his letter and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

04:20 Morris Corlew says, "Ah well."

04:20 Morris flops back into his beanbag.

04:20 Pierre-Louis says to Evenia, "Is the coffee more important than the underwear?"

04:20 Morris Corlew sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

04:20 Katina says to Morris, "Lick the crease."

04:20 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

04:20 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft meanders in from the east.

04:20 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft sits down on a huge comfy couch.

04:20 Katina says to Morris, "If you wanted a sufficent tear."

04:20 Morris says to Katina, "Wouldn't be big enough for nothin. I'd have to use a couple."

04:20 Evenia says to Pierre-Louis, "Yes. Sanity yes. Give me good coffee and I'd live naked if I had to."

04:20 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:20 Morris says to Evenia, "Don't tell him that."

04:21 Evenia gulps loudly.

04:21 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Is okay, I not have good coffee."

04:21 You say to Evenia, "Too much info for my innocent ears."

04:21 Evenia Callseah sighs at you. "Mmhmm."

04:21 Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.

04:21 Melinda Michaels strides west.

04:22 Melinda Michaels strides in from the west.

04:22 Melinda Michaels sits down on a huge comfy couch.

04:22 Morris Corlew snaps his fingers.

04:22 Morris Corlew scrambles to his feet.

04:22 Morris Corlew shuffles west.

04:22 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the west.

04:22 Morris Corlew sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

04:22 Evenia gently guides Johann Schraft's arm up from around her middle, to a gentle drape around her neck.

04:22 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft smiles.

04:23 Morris Corlew kisses a letter.

04:23 Morris Corlew stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

04:23 Morris Corlew shuffles west.

04:23 Katina makes a face.

04:23 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the west.

04:23 Morris Corlew sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

04:23 Morris Corlew glances around at his surroundings.

04:23 Katina says to Morris, "Uh. Yeah."

04:23 Morris says to Katina, "What."

04:24 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a tube of nondescript tea.

04:24 "So what?" Evenia Callseah shrugs. "I've kissed many a letter. Written things in them that would make you blush till your face fell off, as well."

04:24 Katina Faye says, "I dunno. I'm moody. Will tame it."

04:24 Melinda Michaels says to Morris, "I think you are the only one drawing attention to your kissing the letter. No worries, we all saw but it's not a big deal."

04:24 Melinda Michaels grins.

04:24 Katina Faye absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

04:25 Katina says to Morris, "Maybe she will mail you a lock of her hair."

04:25 Morris smiles sheepishly. "Just close quarters I guess."

04:25 Melinda says to Morris, "Nobody cares."

04:25 Evenia Callseah says, "Now if you like. Licked it or slipped it under your gown. I think we'd at least be curious."

04:25 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels. "Thanks."

04:25 Melinda says to Morris, "But you apparently."

04:25 Cheri Lindbergh exclaims, "I wouldn't!"

04:25 Melinda Michaels gives Evenia Callseah a thumbs up!

04:25 Morris Corlew smirks.

04:26 You hear Aisling the Fox yell, "Melinda, how long were you in here last?"

04:26 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm curious, I'd just have to ask why. But I wouldn't care."

04:26 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "I'd wince in pain for scrotal papercuts."

04:26 Katina Faye blushes.

04:26 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Melinda Michaels yells, "A day or two."

04:26 Evenia says to Johann, "Did you ever kiss letters you've sent me?"

04:27 You snuggle up to Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:27 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:27 Ather Jammoa says, "Wait, people kiss letters? Explain why."

04:27 Evenia Callseah shrugs.

04:27 You shrug.

04:27 Johann says to Evenia, "No. It would smear the ink, or compromise the integrity of the paper. I just store all your letters in their own portfolio."

04:27 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Lily Kaise yells, "Did all of the crew leave the ship at the same time though and you had no hold up in their quarters left behind?"

04:27 Katina says to Ather, "And Aisling is right. I am your friend."

04:27 Evenia Callseah asks, "It's just a thing. Like...Ever heard of those people who kiss a fish before putting it back in the water? like after they catch it?"

04:27 Johann says to Evenia, "Then I read them any time I need a pick-me-up."

04:27 Melinda says to Ather, "Because they are mushy romantics who think the other person will somehow know they've done it."

04:28 Morris Corlew looks at Evenia Callseah thoughtfully.

04:28 Morris Corlew asks, "Kiss a fish?"

04:28 You say to Evenia, "Yuck! I'd nver kiss a fish after I caught it or ever really."

04:28 Katina says to Morris, "Next time, put lipstick on."

04:28 You say, "Never."

04:28 Morris says to Katina, "Ain't got none."

04:28 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:28 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Wow I love my fish but I would neither smell them nor kiss them thank you!"

04:28 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft asks, "You wouldn't kiss a sprite?"

04:28 You laugh at Lily Kaise.

04:28 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:28 Lily Kaise says, "No."

04:28 Morris Corlew grins at Lily Kaise.

04:28 You say to Lily, "Good or I'd definitely not kiss you after you kissed a fish."

04:28 Ather Jammoa says, "Man, you're all weird. I wouldn't kiss half the shit you all would apparently be willing to kiss."

04:29 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft grins at Ather Jammoa.

04:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:29 Evenia Callseah says, "I heard of it. Sometimes. People would catch a fish. And to like...wish it luck in it's future. they'd kiss it before sending it on it's way."

04:29 Katina says to Morris, "It just seems pointless. Why kiss a letter if the receiver of the letter would have no idea what ou did?"

04:29 Lily Kaise laughs at you.

04:29 Morris says to Katina, "Wasn't for her."

04:29 Ather says to Evenia, "And that's probably why the civilizations who use to do those things failed and died out."

04:29 Melinda Michaels kisses Kani Kahakai on the lips.

04:29 Evenia says to Johann, "And seriously? You keep all my letters off on their own?"

04:29 Melinda Michaels says, "Look people."

04:29 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:29 Katina says to Morris, "Oh. Oh. Ooh."

04:29 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft nods to Evenia Callseah.

04:30 Melinda Michaels says, "Do not be kissing things that aren't part of your partner."

04:30 Melinda Michaels grins.

04:30 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:30 Johann says to Evenia, "Even the bland station letters, some of them anyway."

04:30 Evenia Callseah looks at Ather Jammoa and shrugs. "You've probably got a point."

04:30 Morris Corlew says, "I dunno. I was just thinkin bout her."

04:30 Evenia Callseah says, "But fuck me dead, I will kiss the first coffee I get when I'm out of here. I will French kiss that thing like I've never kissed before."

04:31 You fight the urge to cover your ears as Melinda Michaels yells, "Lily, why are you yelling? You are sitting right here."

04:31 Melinda Michaels beams.

04:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah uh that's weird too."

04:31 Katina says to Evenia, "My mind is warped, but fuck you dead disturbs me."

04:31 Johann says to Evenia, "Note to self, dress up as a mug of coffee."

04:31 Ather Jammoa says, "I might relish eating and/or drinking something which I hvae not eaten and/or drank in a while, but I won't overly obsess."

04:32 Evenia says to Ather, "My day doesn't begin without at least, 3 cups of good coffee. It's in my vanes."

04:32 "How about fuck me sideways and up-side-down?" Evenia Callseah looks at Katina Faye and shrugs.

04:32 Katina blushes crimson.

04:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Then you have more pressing concerns, likely that need to be addressed. Probably by checking into a rehabilitation facility, and meeting with a few alliance psychologists."

04:32 Ather Jammoa shrugs helplessly.

04:32 Evenia Callseah chortles. "I knew that would happen."

04:33 You chuckle at Evenia Callseah.

04:33 Katina says to Johann, "Help?"

04:33 Evenia says to Ather, "I can go without it, clearly. But I love it."

04:33 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft grins at Katina Faye.

04:34 Katina Faye glowers at Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft.

04:34 Evenia says to Katina, "Fuck me raw? Fuck me crazy? Fuck me senseless? Fuck me blind? Fuck me with a chopstick? I could go on."

04:34 You say to Katina, "Not sure it'd be much use appealing to him for help."

04:34 You chuckle.

04:35 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Chopsticks are narrow. Might need to make it like a rolling pin."

04:35 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Word fuck has been said a few times."

04:35 Katina says to Johann, "Your girlfriend is suggesting naughty things I do to her."

04:35 Katina Faye gasps.

04:35 Katina says to Johann, "You mother fluffer."

04:35 Morris Corlew says, "A rollin'"

04:35 Morris Corlew says, "Wow."

04:35 Evenia Callseah winces. "Ow. Fucking hell, a...ow."

04:35 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Well, it's better than my saying."

04:36 Evenia says to Johann, "Which one?"

04:36 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Fuck me with a fork."

04:36 Morris Corlew winces.

04:36 You say, "Now that sounds painful."

04:36 Evenia Callseah laughs.

04:36 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "But it rolls right off the tongue."

04:36 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Fiddle works too."

04:36 You say, "But hey, to each his or her own."

04:37 Katina Faye says, "Okay."

04:37 Katina Faye says, "So."

04:37 Katina Faye gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

04:37 Katina Faye says, "I like classical music."

04:37 Evenia Callseah chortles.

04:37 You say to Katina, "What's your favorite piece of classical music?"

04:37 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Me too. Watching those string players bow their g strings is sexy."

04:37 Evenia Callseah says, "How about those torpedos? They had lovely torpedos last time I got more for my ship."

04:37 Morris Corlew asks, "Why would you do such a thing to a fiddle?"

04:38 Katina's mouth falls open and she stares at Johann.

04:38 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft asks, "And you know what they say about cello players?"

04:38 Katina says to Johann, "Shut up."

04:38 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "They can't keep their legs closed."

04:38 Katina blushes crimson.

04:38 Evenia tosses back her head, unable to stop laughing.

04:38 Morris Corlew says, "Well...I mean if you're technical..."

04:38 You chuckle.

04:38 Lily Kaise smirks.

04:39 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft asks, "Hell, the holes on those things are called f holes. I mean, why the hell not?"

04:41 Gradually Evenia's laughter settles, and she relaxes back against Johann Schraft's side.

04:42 You say, "I was always told not to date piano players because they bang pretty hard."

04:42 You say, "I mean."

04:42 Katina Faye groans.

04:42 You say, "But I never knew what they meant."

04:42 Lily glances sideways at shule!

04:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:42 Ather Jammoa scrambles to his feet.

04:42 Ather Jammoa strides south.

04:43 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Meh, piano players are okay. You really need someone who can whale on the pipe organ."

04:43 You chuckle.

04:43 Morris Corlew asks, "Is that innuendo?"

04:43 Evenia Callseah giggles uncontrollably.

04:43 Katina Faye says, "Guuuuys."

04:43 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:43 Evenia Callseah says, "Stop it. My sides. My sides..."

04:43 Evenia Callseah laughs.

04:43 Melinda Michaels laughs. "Of course it is."

04:43 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:44 You laugh.

04:44 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft asks, "And did you know back in the day, they called a trombone a sackbut?"

04:44 You nod to Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft.

04:44 Evenia covers Johann Schraft's mouth, in an attempt to stop him.

04:44 Katina Faye says, "Yeah um."

04:44 Katina Faye blushes.

04:45 Katina Faye says, "Goodnight."

04:45 Katina Faye wanders south.

04:45 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft exclaims, "Thank you! I'm here all week!"

04:45 Morris Corlew chuckles.

04:45 You chuckle at Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft.

04:45 Lily Kaise groans.

04:45 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Or at least until they let you all go and I have nobody to annoy."

04:45 Lily Kaise says, "Noooooo."

04:45 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:45 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I'll bribe that guy up front I will!"

04:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:45 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:45 Melinda Michaels giggles.

04:45 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:45 Morris Corlew says, "With..."

04:45 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:45 Evenia Callseah says, "Hey. If y'all get too annoying. Mel and I will set Kani and Johann on you guys. And then go hide."

04:45 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a tube of nondescript tea.

04:45 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We'll decontaminazation break!"

04:45 Melinda Michaels says, "We sure will."

04:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:45 Morris Corlew grins.

04:46 Lily Kaise says, "Er something."

04:46 You chuckle.

04:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Is time for a sleep, keep on quarantining."

04:46 Evenia Callseah nods and nods.

04:46 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah pretty much same here very soonish."

04:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Quarantine the best you can."

04:46 Lily Kaise waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

04:46 You wave to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

04:46 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Oh, someone should stop us and chart. I want to know how far we have to go."

04:46 Melinda Michaels laughs.

04:46 Evenia Callseah says, "Kani and Johann bouncing back and forth in conversation is...Usually after about 2 minutes I wanna shake them both."

04:47 Morris Corlew waves to Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys.

04:47 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yes someone must!"

04:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys stands up from a shapeless beanbag.

04:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

04:47 You say, "I don't like this riftscape."

04:47 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys moves south.

04:47 Lily Kaise exclaims, "And probe oh wait... we've already been probed!"

04:47 Johann glances around for the rift comm button.

04:47 Melinda nods to Evenia as she grins at Kani.

04:47 You chuckle at Lily Kaise.

04:47 Morris Corlew grins at you.

04:47 You grin.

04:47 Lily Kaise asks, "Yeah it's pretty blah?"

04:48 Lily Kaise snickers.

04:48 "Where's our NDB?" Evenia Callseah gasps. "I don't see any kind of reading!"

04:48 Morris Corlew points vaguely off into space.

04:48 You ask, "But do you know what they want?"

04:48 Morris Corlew says, "Terrible things."

04:48 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "We are too deep in the rift for the NDB."

04:48 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

04:48 Lily Kaise exclaims, "We got totally off the chart and so we're all out here... together!"

04:48 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft asks, "Hey, how did Aisling get her catbot into quarrentine?"

04:48 Morris Corlew asks, "Woo?"

04:49 Morris Corlew looks at Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft and shrugs.

04:49 Lily Kaise says, "Woo yeh."

04:49 Aisling the Fox prances in from the east.
Manx the little calico CatBot trots happily in after Aisling the Fox with a quiet hiss of hydraulics.

04:49 Evenia Callseah says, "Someone, load me in a torpedo tube please. I'm out."

04:49 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:49 Morris Corlew strokes Manx the little calico CatBot lovingly.

04:49 Aisling the Fox sits down on a shapeless beanbag.

04:50 Evenia tweaks Johann Schraft's nose.

04:50 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft snorts.

04:50 Evenia Callseah laughs.

04:51 Evenia says to Johann, "I'm bored, so I'm now down to the part on my list where I annoy you."

04:51 Cheri Lindbergh takes a sip of a tube of nondescript tea.

04:51 Melinda Michaels says, "We'll be here for a bit."

04:51 Morris Corlew nods.

04:51 Cheri says to Aisling the Fox, "Was it good?"

04:51 Aisling the Fox says, "Conversation? Yes."

04:51 Evenia Callseah says, "I know. Which means I get to think up all kinds of fun ways to annoy him."

04:51 "Great!" Cheri Lindbergh nods.

04:52 Johann wrinkles and crinkles a white paper gown loudly and persistently.

04:52 Cheri Lindbergh grins.

04:52 Evenia Callseah glares at Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft.

04:52 Cheri Lindbergh finishes off a tube of nondescript tea.

04:52 Morris Corlew grins at Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft.

04:52 Cheri Lindbergh says, "If only we had lager to drink in front of Johann."

04:52 Johann says to Evenia, "I am so keeping this and wearing it on a regular basis."

04:52 Melinda Michaels grins.

04:52 Morris Corlew gives Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft a thumbs up!

04:53 Evenia says to Johann, "Really? I am so going to make pia vanish then."

04:53 Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft says, "Beer flavored paste would be nasty."

04:53 Evenia Callseah hums a quiet tune.

04:53 You stretch.

04:53 You say, "Night all."

04:53 Cheri Lindbergh nods to Blockade Smasher Johann Schraft.

04:53 You stand up from a small metal chair.

04:53 Morris Corlew waves to you.

04:53 Cheri Lindbergh waves to you.

04:53 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:53 Cheri Lindbergh stands up from a huge comfy couch.

04:53 You say to Lily, "Night babe."

04:53 Cheri Lindbergh puts an empty tube in a large bin with the biohazard symbol on the side.

04:53 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

04:53 Lily Kaise stands up from a small metal chair.

04:53 Johann says to Evenia, "I will shave Admiral Awesome, so he's bald."

04:53 Cheri Lindbergh says, "I'm gonna get a nap, have a good one."

04:53 Melinda Michaels waves.

04:54 You wave to Cheri Lindbergh.

04:54 Morris says to Cheri, "Later."

04:54 Lily Kaise walks south.

04:54 [Bio-Contaminant Quarantine; Corridor]

04:54 Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go north, east, south, and west.

04:54 Lily says to you, "I love you too. I'll see you in a couple of cycles."

04:54 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

04:54 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:55 Lily says to you, "Rest well and sweet dreams Love."

04:55 You say to Lily, "You too."

04:55 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:55 Lily Kaise kisses you.

04:55 I don't understand that.

04:55 Lily Kaise whispers, "I'll love you forever too."

04:55 You beam at Lily Kaise.

04:55 Lily says to you, "Nite."

04:55 You peer east...

04:55 
[Bio-Contaminant Quarantine; Male Dorm]
This room is fairly large and painted in a subdued light green. A full dozen king-sized beds are spread across the room, looking surprisingly comfortable.
Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn is sleeping on the floor. Ted Warburton, Damien Alexander, and Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys are sleeping on a fluffy king-sized bed.
Ali Candan, Tobias Hawthorne, Damien Goss, and Keegan Wantz are dozing on a fluffy king-sized bed. Ather Jammoa is lying on a fluffy king-sized bed.

04:56 You lie down.

04:56 You blink heavily and then doze off.

05:11 Ted Warburton suddenly awakens.

05:14 Ted Warburton stands up from a fluffy king-sized bed.

05:14 Ted Warburton wanders west.

05:28 Keegan Wantz scrambles to his feet.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Unlike the rest of the quarantine habitat, this chamber is bare dark metal and clearly designed to be strong. Heavy metal plating covers the walls, floor and ceiling. The exit door is no exception; a massive device that looks like the entryway to some kind of ancient fallout shelter. There are no controls on this side of it.
You see a technician in a biohazard suit here.
You can go south.

19:14 You walk up to a technician in a biohazard suit, who nods briefly, retrieves a completely sealed box labeled 'Elemmire, Shule' from a stack of very similar boxes, sets it down, and begins listing out its contents.
(85 seconds roundtime.)

19:16 Wait 7 seconds.

19:16 [EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Decontamination]

19:16 This chamber is bare dark metal and clearly designed to be tough. Heavy metal plating covers the walls, floor and ceiling. The airlock door is no exception; a massive device that looks like the entryway to some kind of ancient fallout shelter. A window in one wall reveals a control room with two security guards inside.

[EAOS Quarantine Facility; Bio-Contaminant Visitor's Lobby]
At first this appears to simply be an extremely large room, but careful observation reveals that it is bisected by some kind of almost invisible barrier at a black line on the floor and ceiling. Sound appears to pass through it, but objects are stopped. Touching the barrier gives no sensation, only the fact that your hand does not go beyond it reveals it exists at all. Several chairs are arranged on both halves of the room, with a door on the opposite side of the barrier leading west to the main gathering area of quarantine, while a door on this side leads northwest back to the station proper.

19:23 [EAOS Quarantine Facility; Docking Bay]

19:23 While fairly small for a docking bay and clearly not a major hub, this place can still easily hold multiple starships. Several dozen lights on one wall slowly blink green in sequence, and the staircase leading up has a security checkpoint with three guards.
The one-person runabout "Let's Run" and the stealth galleon "Zro Des Cartes" are landed here.
You see a tridimensional holocamera here.

19:23 You say, "Torus."

19:23 Johann Schraft uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:23 Johann Schraft nods.

19:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Cosmic Crossings, you are given launch clearance under the League-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:24 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:24 Johann Schraft makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.

19:24 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:24 The starship transitions into another sector.

19:24 Johann Schraft presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

19:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:24 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

19:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be a League ship, Cosmic Crossings. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

19:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

19:25 You say, "Thanks."

19:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

19:25 You wave.

19:25 [Starship "Cosmic Crossings"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:25 You exit the ship.

19:26 You suddenly notice that you are carrying two objects in one hand and drop one of them, a completely sealed box labeled 'Elemmire, Shule', in sudden confusion.

19:26 You can't wear anymore items like that.

19:26 You can't eat a sealed tube of pizza-flavored nutrition paste.

19:26 I don't understand that.

19:26 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

19:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

19:43 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:43 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into.

20:00 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

20:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
