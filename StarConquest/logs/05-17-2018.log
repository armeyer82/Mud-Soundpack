01:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]

01:53 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

01:53 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

03:27 [Newbie Help] Lucien D'Avignon transmits, "My god the character concept process is crazy hard for me. I write a good sentence and they want another piece of information. I can only fit so much information in one sentence and I can only use so many comma and semicolon tricks to extend it hehe."

03:27 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins stirs and slowly unfolds his eight hairy legs.

03:27 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Try makinng it more vague perhaps?"

03:28 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "From what others have said. More vague is better. I personally didn't ever have to do it myself. But that's the information I've picked up."

03:28 [Newbie Help] Lucien D'Avignon transmits, "Yeah that is what I did with this last submission."

03:30 Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo wanders out.

03:31 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What's possibly more confusing is this is just the concept. It's kind of the title. After you complete this part you'll go and be a little more detailed."

03:31 [Newbie Help] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "I wrote my profile before I did mine if that helps any..."

03:32 [Newbie Help] Squidmind transmits, "Another good prompt is: Someone else is going to play your character for you for a day. In one sentence, how would you tell them to play?"

03:33 [Newbie Help] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Yeah, I had trouble with that too. Until I just sat down and wrote an uber detailed story about me and then drew from there, but then again, everyone is different. I had to go deeper though to draw it out of myself."

03:33 [Newbie Help] Johann Schraft transmits, "That makes a lot more sense when you put it like that."

03:34 [Newbie Help] Lucien D'Avignon transmits, "I have the whole backstory in my head but cutting that down to a sentence is really hard. I'm the guy in writing class that would sit down to write a 200 word essay and end up with 1200 in the first draft and go "Well Shit.""

03:34 [Newbie Help] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "If you are having troulbe, I'd write out the story first and then see what you can draw from there. I'm like that too, that is why I sat down and just wrote her out."

03:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hill when I mentioned I couldn't get mail was really sarcastic. I mean for me I could care less if I can ever get another piece of mail. I just mentioned it because I was attempting to give a cute felo away. I care more about the fact that we're not in deep space going after terrorists as I consider rogue navy to be terrorists."

03:59 You say, "AEU pilots that is."

03:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I feel sorry for them because they don't have access to their personal things. Maybe Casen has things in her ship but Constantine only came here in his Capsule. So we should encourage him to go use one of the org ships if he wants a bit more space."

03:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No we can't use ITPN."

21:01 You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, and Belle the big silver feathered felo kitten here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

21:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

21:01 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy ruby red ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and gold aquatic life and coral rocks, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a silver holo projector, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is standing here.
You can go south and out.

21:01  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a gold wrist-mounted chronometer, a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a backpack, and a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a flight control scanner, a black engineering tool case, a scorched metal thigh holster, and a large expandable telescoping xenology container. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying nothing.

21:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:33 [Apartment 9004; Living Chamber]

23:33 This is a large oval chamber made of smooth stone. The stone is mostly black, though subtle white speckles are visible in the nearly frictionless walls. Crystals appear to grow naturally from the floor, in addition to a spectacularly complex, fragile-looking crystal attached to the ceiling. They could almost be natural, except for the fact that they constantly emit a dim glow. One might expect a stone chamber to be damp and cold, but in fact it is somehow kept perfectly comfortable.

23:42 You peer out...

23:42 
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 199" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.

23:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

23:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:42 The ship is already moving.

23:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:42 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:42 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:42 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:42 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:42 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:42 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:43 The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Peregrine Falcon" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

23:43 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Hi"

23:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:43 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:43 Via general sector communication, Peregrine Falcon directs a text-based transmission at this ship: "yo"
The computer reports that the vostok-class capsule "Peregrine Falcon" has jumped out of the sector.

23:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:43 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:43 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
