Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a pair of washed
light khaki canvas sneakers, and a pair of white socks here.
You can go out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a

sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this

the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard
and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

sometimes but i've never seen him twitch."

even. It was super sad."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[General Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "But did he get fed and improve?"

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and

said in your book."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "What's up?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The rift is up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is it a viable
strategy to use weaker lasers when you have 6 of them? Like I was thinking about
the best 3s firing ones, for example."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They do less
damage, but use less power, and have an 8% hull hit bonus."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll tell you what I
told a lot of others before."
[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Not much, would like to talk
to you sometime, but now is not good."

[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I will try to caught you
sometime later."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "That works."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The heavy fighters
are nice, well-armed, well-armored ships. However, they have severe limitations
which in a lot of cases just make them not viable for everyday use. The grid
issue is definitely one, but so is the fact that they can't jump. That's why a
lot of even the most advanced pilots honestly, still use the cadet fighters."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I like the
flexibility of the cadet fighter's jump drive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Decent armaments, not
horrific armor, and can FTL."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also I feel like
the two launchers on the heavy are overkill."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They just use
too much power."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right now I have
them loaded with the weakest guided torpedos, and that works okay."
[0m#UNSNOOPING SESSION 'StarConquest'[0m
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I started with an ETA of an
hour 40. After an hour 13, it's down to an hour 25."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "At this time, they're
definitely overkill, since we don't have energy grids that can recharge that
fast yet, or that can hold a great amount of power. Maybe in the long-term we
might get something that will make them more worthwhile, but not at present. You
think they're bad with torpedos, they're even worse with minicannons."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "From the bubble?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, what
are those, 200 per shot?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can't buy them
yet but I think I might stick with torpedos for a while even once I can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Something like that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not that far
away from being able to buy the jackrabbit grid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That should help
a little, larger grid and faster recharge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Take it from me, it's
still not going to help too much. Especially when you get the good 15 damage
point crystaline lasers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, that's
true, there are beefier lasers I still need to get."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Even engineering
tools at expert levels barely make the heavy fighter useable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, are there
better energy dumps I can make?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe not me
personally, but eventually."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton snores.
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Been bubbling?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, I went out there, but it
was a slow day, so I decided to come back, and that's even slower."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They require more
points to use, but yes, there are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You get the
blueprints for them from the glyphmakers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm almost able
to head out there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It's certainly an
experience."

anything goes, honestly. Except like, storage increase, and max velocity
increase. Obviously, none of the exploration plants, either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Interesting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But the weapons ones
are good depending on your loadout. Hull increase is good too, grid increase is
fine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What does the
laser plant take away from?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I forget right off
the bat. Remind me later!"
