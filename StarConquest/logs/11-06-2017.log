00:04 A massive sphere looms ahead of the hovertruck, soon becoming evident as a slow-rolling ball of tentacles. The truck moves around it smoothly.

00:15 An arc of light much like a meteor draws itself in the sky overhead.

00:21 The hovertruck slows, the highway ahead growing dark.

00:31 An ancient hovercar flashes past, broken down on the side of the highway.

00:34 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

00:34 The mist swirls and obscures your vision. It quickly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

00:51 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

01:00 0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

01:04 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

01:14 The stars of an unknown galaxy twinkle above in the fading light of day.

01:25 The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.

01:26 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

01:30 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How do I use this shaving kit?"

01:30 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Looking at it gives you the command."

01:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Check the commands on it."

01:36 Fluffy pink clouds drift carelessly through the lavender sky.

01:36 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of dust rolls in. As quickly as it comes, it is gone, and you find yourself back in the starship.

01:36 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

02:06 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

02:17 A shoal of silver scaled fish, numbering in the thousands, form an amorphous blob that glitters in front of the starship's lights. They suddenly disperse as a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.

02:27 A transparent, bioluminescent fish appears from the depths, glowing electric blue. It swims alongside the starship for a few moments then disappears.

02:29 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

02:37 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

02:37 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

02:40 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "How do I lie someone down who is standing or is there a way?"

02:40 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can only do it without their permission if they're idle (standing in a stupor) or asleep, number one."

02:41 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "2, the syntax is put <person> on <object>."

02:41 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You can lie someone down?"

02:41 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh."

02:41 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I thought you meant just put them on the floor."

02:41 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Yes I was wondering if there is a way to make them lie on the floor if you do not have furniture."

02:41 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "And they are stadning."

02:41 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "If they're standing in a stupor, and it looks weird to you, and you're so inclined, put them on an object. Otherwise, no. Put furniture in the room."

02:42 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or...just ignore it."

02:42 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Thanks."

03:03 Lily Kaise glides in from the west.

03:03 Lily Kaise sits down on an insulated red sleeping bag.

03:03 Lily Kaise slumps in an insulated red sleeping bag and goes to sleep.

03:07 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

03:17 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

03:28 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

03:35 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

03:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:35 Lily Kaise stands up from an insulated red sleeping bag.

03:35 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

03:35 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:35 You stand up from a narrow bunk.

03:35  You are wearing a dark blue shipsuit with cobalt blue trim around the collar and cuffs and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

03:35 You are carrying nothing.

03:36 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

03:36 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Block]

03:36 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a large leather couch, and Alexay the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, east, south, west, and down.

03:36 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Main Deck]

03:36 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Allied Libertarians", a large leather couch, a mahogany coffee table, and a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

03:36 You peer north...

03:36 
[Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Control Room]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a large leather couch, a compact white refrigerator, a black plastic trash can, an elegant crystal decanter, Raiatea the arachnoid security robot, an insulated white cooler, and Manx the little calico CatBot here.
Johann Schraft is sitting on a black leather captain's chair. Damien Alexander and Aisling the Fox are dozing on a large leather couch. Lily Kaise is sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go south and out.

03:36 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hullooooo to all of the sleepy pilots around here."

03:36 You wave to Johann Schraft.

03:36 Lily Kaise chuckles at Johann Schraft.

03:37 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:37 Lily Kaise says, "Nothin and nothin' and more nothin'"

03:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

03:37 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

03:38 Johann Schraft says, "Oh I don't know, we found three things."

03:38 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

03:38 Lily Kaise says, "True."

03:38 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Dove's Dragoons!"

03:38 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Woo!"

03:38 Johann Schraft nods.

03:38 Johann Schraft says, "And another downfall, and an oort."

03:39 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

03:39 There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

03:39 Lily Kaise points at an insulated white cooler.

03:40 Lily says to you, "I brought some meat dogs and brews... help yourself!"

03:40 Lily Kaise exclaims, "And anyone else too!"

03:40 Lily Kaise opens an insulated white cooler and the light inside clicks on.

03:40 You say to Lily, "Thanks. I might here in a little bit."

03:40 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:41 Lily Kaise removes a hot meat dog on a toasted bun from an insulated white cooler.

03:57 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

04:02 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

04:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:13 A beam of light shines through the air, quickly fading to sparkling dust.

04:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

04:23 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

04:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:33 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

04:37 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

04:39 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

04:39 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

04:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:00 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Why does it go yo yo yo wen I just put a letter o?"

05:00 [Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Because o is not a word."

05:00 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's called a word filter."

05:00 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The word you're looking for is o-h. Not just the letter O."

05:00 [Newbie Help] Lily Kaise transmits, "Because the word is actually oh."

05:00 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "There's a bunch of filters, like the woot! One."

05:01 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Woot!"

05:01 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok that doesn't work on newbie. Anyway you get the idea."

05:04 Damien Alexander stands up from a large leather couch.

05:04 Damien Alexander stretches.

05:05 You nod to Damien Alexander.

05:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:05 Damien Alexander says, "See you guys later."

05:05 Damien Alexander waves.

05:05 You wave to Damien Alexander.

05:05 Damien Alexander tramps south.

05:05 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Goodnight Damien."

05:06 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

05:08 I see no "meatdog" here.

05:26 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

05:28 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "So I did the mission for the corpses. I had about 14000 units. I came back and transfered it because I didn't think I could fit more. I went back after the transfer and got more. But wen it landed it didn't say I finished the mission."

05:29 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "My cargo hauler can only hold 15000."

05:31 A Tardick lizard named Thor flicks its tongue out from its perch on Aisling the Fox's shoulder.

05:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did you turn in anything other than the corpses?"

05:33 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "No."

05:33 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

05:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did you just land the second time or did you transfer the second batch?"

05:33 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "I guess ill just go look for more. It just was strange."

05:33 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Transfer."

05:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "How much did they ask you for?"

05:33 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "15000."

05:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Maybe you were a couple units short. Try to get another 1000 units or so and see if that does it."

05:35 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

05:41 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

05:41 You hear a loud call in front of you, and the flock shifts as one, finding a new updraft.

05:42 A Tardick lizard named Thor, perched on Aisling the Fox's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:48 Lily Kaise stands up from a large leather couch.

05:53 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Nope. Didn't work. I had about 5 k units."

05:53 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You're getting them all from the sector they asked for and also you didn't possibly miss it, did you?"

05:53 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Yeah from the sector they asked me too. And it still shows up wen I type mission."

05:54 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "They said b-67."

05:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

05:54 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

05:55 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not sure what to tell you."

06:00 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

06:07 [Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "You have to go turn the mission in where you got it."

06:07 [Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Assuming you have completed the requirements."

06:07 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "I did go there and type complete."

06:07 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "He said it was still in his missions though."

06:08 [Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Ah, perhaps you were salvaging someone else's bari corpses?"

06:08 [Newbie Help] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I'm not sure it counts if they are not the ones spawned for -you-, but the hosts would have to verify that I think."

06:08 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's why I asked him if maybe he just missed the thing about it saying he'd completed a mission. But since he got it from the right sector, got more than it needed, and it's still in his list of misisons, I don't know."

06:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:08 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It doesn't. I grabbed IFS in a sector I was supposed to get OUtsiders once and it didn't count for either."

06:09 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "They said to jump to b-67 and I did."

06:09 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Or is there a d67 too."

06:09 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't believe so, no."

06:10 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "The first time I loaded up with a bit over 14000 units. I think I had 600 left."

06:11 The sound of wind and flapping wings fills your ears.

06:14 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Best I can suggest at this point Jake is to send a support. Staff would be the only ones who could tell you what went wrong."

06:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:21 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

06:22 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "I wonder if in that kind of situtation they could add something to the mission that would let you know how much you had braught back. Example you have got 12000 out of 15000 units for this mission."

06:23 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There's a place for suggestions like that. Staff aren't always around, so send a support or put it on the appropriate board."

06:27 The flock finds a large updraft and rapidly gains altitude.

06:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:37 The flock's leader retires to another part of the V formation, and another bird replaces it.

06:42 The flock banks suddenly, and you turn to follow, but no other bird is in sight. The scene abruptly fades.

06:42 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

06:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:55 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

07:04 Johann Schraft's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anybody awake back there?"

07:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

07:12 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

07:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:22 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

07:25 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

07:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

07:36 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

07:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:43 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

07:44 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

07:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:58 You look down at your watch, but you find that you cannot comprehend the concept of time.

08:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

08:13 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

08:16 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:24 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

08:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:34 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

08:36 You open your mouth to speak a line, but only a wet gurgle comes out.

08:44 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:44 The curtains close, to no applause.

08:44 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

08:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:14 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

09:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:24 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before they fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

09:25 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

09:31 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

09:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:46 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

09:46 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

09:46 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

09:46 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

09:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:55 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

09:55 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

09:56 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

09:56 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

09:57 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

09:57 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

09:57 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

09:58 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

09:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

10:02 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Is it possible to move my battlesuit from old earth, to new earth, without a mule?"

10:02 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think so."

10:02 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not with anything you can get yet, no. You'd have to get another pilot to help you."

10:02 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I see."

10:03 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not unless another pilot can help who has a gemini. You would have to ask IC for help."

10:03 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And doing low deployments on old earth would contribute towards the league, rather than the AEU I'm guessing?"

10:03 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. You're doing the work, so the AEU gets credit."

10:03 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Oh."

10:14 You hear voices crying in panic. "Oh no, the brakes!" The train picks up speed rapidly.

10:14 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

10:14 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

10:25 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

10:29 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

10:32 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

10:32 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

10:33 With a sudden screech, the train manages to apply its brakes.

10:33 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

10:33 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

10:34 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

10:34 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

10:38 You hear voices crying in panic. "Oh no, the brakes!" The train picks up speed rapidly.

10:38 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

10:38 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

10:39 With a sudden screech, the train manages to apply its brakes.

10:39 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

10:39 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

10:48 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

10:48 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

11:18 Bullets zip overhead, fired from an enemy machine gun on the battlefield.

11:28 Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and mangled stump where his right arm once was.

11:39 The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.

11:49 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

11:49 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

12:05 [Newbie Help] Daniel Blackwell transmits, "Hi all, is there a command to unequip/get rid of battlesuit modules? To put this into context, I'm trying to upgrade my tesla equipment."

12:05 [Newbie Help] Brad Pinkett transmits, "Type sell."

12:05 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "For tesla modules, I belive the command is SELL."

12:05 [Newbie Help] Daniel Blackwell transmits, "Awesome, thanks."

12:07 You shift your weight, but your feet seem to be stuck in some sort of muck.

12:07 The heat from the stage light is oppressive.

12:07 You begin dry heaving.

12:08 The stage lights flicker briefly.

12:19 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

12:29 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

12:40 A high-pitched whine fills your senses.

12:50 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

12:51 The curtains close, to no applause.

12:51 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

13:21 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

13:31 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

13:37 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

13:37 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

13:37 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

13:42 A large metal arm swings into place over the ship, grabs it, lifts it, and turns to place it on another conveyor belt.

13:42 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

13:43 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

13:52 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

13:52 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

14:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

14:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

14:22 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

14:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

14:33 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

14:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

14:38 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

14:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

14:49 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

14:54 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

14:54 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

14:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

15:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

15:24 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

15:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

15:34 The ship drifts by a number of bodies lying in a vile, thick slush.

15:41 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "How do you explain a title ic?"

15:41 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They appear on comm screens just like your name. That one though is cause of a typo, so I'm not sure how you'd explain it."

15:42 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Yeah that's the problem..."

15:42 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "You could explain it as something your character is known for."

15:42 [Newbie Help] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Optionally you can also turn off the title."

15:42 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "Blek my profile isn't good enough to be approved yet sadly. Working on it."

15:42 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Can you do that with those?"

15:42 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "How."

15:43 [Newbie Help] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "The title command."

15:43 [Newbie Help] Daniel Blackwell transmits, "Try typing title, see if you can set it to none."

15:43 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I always assumed they stayed on till a host removed them. I guess I was wrong."

15:43 [Newbie Help] Moveing confermation Jake Smith transmits, "It doesn't show up there."

15:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:43 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yes, just change your title, then change it to none."

15:43 [Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "Test test."

15:43 [Newbie Help] Daniel Blackwell transmits, "There you go."

15:44 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, if you make too many typos and such like I do sometimes they'll slap one of those on you."

15:44 [Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "But now it doesn't show me up as a cadet though? Cause the options said something about pilot cadet."

15:44 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh, hit title, then put cadett."

15:44 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Cadet."

15:45 Howling, infuriated people inexplicably roll massive weights at each other, tortured bodies straining with the effort.

15:53 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Question, do I ever have an accent? I see some people even have a neutral accent, but I've never once seen it mention that I say something in some accent."

15:53 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Neutral accents are what all cadets have."

15:54 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

15:55 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

15:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

16:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

16:09 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Three]

16:09 The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, a small red insulated cooler, and a small purple trash bin here.
Lily Kaise is dozing on an insulated red sleeping bag.
You can go out.
(You are lying on an insulated red sleeping bag.)

16:09 You blink heavily and then doze off.

16:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

16:19 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "What are IFS?"

16:19 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Help IFS."

16:19 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "They're a collective, from what I was just reading. Help ifs."

16:19 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks."

16:21 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Sure thing."

16:24 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

16:26 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Is there anything specific I need to do to listen to Channel 4? Or do I automatically receive messages on that channel? I guess I'm trying to understand if I can listen to General comms as well as Channel 4 at the same time."

16:26 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Type tune comm to 0."

16:27 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You'll be able to hear all of them."

16:27 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Thanks."

16:27 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "If your communicator is on channel 0 it listens to everything."

16:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:35 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

16:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

16:45 You step forward into another room almost identical to the last. This place seems to go on forever.

16:55 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

16:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

16:57 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

16:57 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

17:03 [Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "Is there a way to see what the Minimodule does?"

17:03 [Newbie Help] Jake Smith transmits, "It tells me what it does. But like a persentege or something."

17:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

17:10 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

17:16 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

17:17 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

17:17 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

17:17 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

17:20 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

17:20 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

17:21 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

17:21 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

17:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

17:22 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

17:22 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How close are we?"

17:22 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

17:25 The deck sways and crewmen cry out routine orders as the ship negotiates a turn.

17:25 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

17:26 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

17:33 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not that I know of, sadly."

17:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

17:36 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "All I could think of is, check commands on the item and try looking at it."

17:36 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "What was the question?"

17:36 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "What is the minimodule."

17:36 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whether you can see the numeral value of the effect of a minimodule."

17:36 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Or rather is there a way he can tell what it does."

17:37 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Oh... no. ok... I don't think you can,. I tend to ask around IC."

17:37 [Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "You might be able to ballpark some of them with some testing, but it might not really be worth the trouble."

17:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

17:47 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

17:50 [Newbie Help] Tamra Swenson transmits, "How do I get my bracelet from being at the end of the list of my char's clothing?"

17:50 [Newbie Help] Ali Candan transmits, "You can remove and wear all of your equipment in order to sort them in the order that you like. You'll need to drop them, too."

17:54 The tone of the starship's ever-present hum suddenly changes slightly.

17:54 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

17:55 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

17:55 [Newbie Help] Tamra Swenson transmits, "Apparently I can't get the bracelet at any other part than the end of my list, how odd, oh well, I dropped and re-put things on."

17:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:03 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

18:03 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

18:03 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

18:03 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

18:04 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

18:04 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

18:05 An impish creature soars toward the platform on its leathery wings, armed with a crude weapon. The platform diverts its course to avoid it.

18:05 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

18:06 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

18:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

18:12 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Is there help for a legend on the starmap symbol meanings?"

18:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

18:33 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

18:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

18:43 Bolts of lightening crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

18:46 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "To pick up a disabled RATS probe do I SALVAGE or GRAPPLE it?"

18:46 [Newbie Help] Kim Saunders transmits, "Salvage it, then pick it up from the storage room."

18:47 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "And is there a way to find it on the Starmap?"

18:47 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Its in rundown."

18:47 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "I went east of the Beacon as per the mission profile. But didn't find it."

18:47 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "As other object."

18:47 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "It might be a few sectors over."

18:47 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Ah ok, thanks."

18:48 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "And is there a way to move more than one coordinate at a time? E.g. "move 5 units west"?"

18:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

18:49 [Newbie Help] Ted Warburton transmits, "Auto pilot."

18:49 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "As always, thanks for the help!"

18:54 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

18:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

19:04 The volcano erupts, sending chunks of half-molten rock flying into the air before they fall from the sky, one narrowly misses hitting the platform.

19:05 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

19:05 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

19:06 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "And it looks like I have to take the ship off of autopilot to transition to another sector, then put it back to fly to the other edge of the sector, then back on manual to transition and so on and so forth?!"

19:06 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Correct."

19:07 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Good deal, thanks."

19:07 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "There is an upgrade you can get at 300 industry that will allow you to move continually in one direction."

19:07 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Ah, nice."

19:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

19:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

19:35 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

19:37 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

19:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

19:48 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

19:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

19:58 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

19:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

20:05 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision.

20:05 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

20:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

20:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

20:26 [Newbie Help] Walter Friedmon transmits, "Is there a way to switch from vector aiming to coordinate aiming."

20:26 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Lockmode is the command."

20:26 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yes. LOCKMODE does it."

20:26 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Lockmode."

20:26 [Newbie Help] Walter Friedmon transmits, "Thanks."

20:27 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's changed per weapons room, so if you're on someone else's ship, be sure to switch it back."

20:27 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Pretty sure it's weapon room specific though."

20:27 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ah."

20:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

20:30 You hear a loud booming sound against the hull.

20:41 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

20:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

20:51 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

20:58 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:01 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

21:06 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

21:06 The curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

21:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:18 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

21:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

21:36 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

21:41 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

21:46 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

21:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

21:57 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

21:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

22:07 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

22:07 [Newbie Help] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Correct me if i'm wrong guys, but I don't think you're allowed to help with player profiles IC guys directed to mike and so on."

22:08 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Not going to."

22:08 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "However there is a way to place ideas ic wise."

22:08 The curtains close, to no applause.

22:08 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

22:08 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not really. Profiles aren't ic at all."

22:08 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I'm actually confused about that. A lot of people refer to them as paperwork, but the help files say to ignore them IC. So... which ones right."

22:08 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "I'm struggling with my profile. But I guess I'll just keep chipping away at it."

22:08 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "We're not supposed to refer to them at all."

22:08 [Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The help file says specifically not to call them paperwork."

22:09 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "The staff are very helpful justin."

22:09 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Justin, talk to your mentor or staff. Also, pay close attention to what they tell you in their responses."

22:09 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Ok."

22:09 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "I thought we weren't supposed to refer to it at all, but mike marshall made me believe differently lately."

22:09 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And if in doubt, support ticket. I had a running theme in mine that I only resolved today after asking them for clarrification."

22:10 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "We're not. Don't listen to Mike Marshall."

22:10 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I think it's just you have a license or you're waiting for it."

22:10 [Newbie Help] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "According to help files, you should *not* refer to profiles IC, but when you sign up to the civilian pilot core, your alliance puts you on a kind of probation, before trusting you with the full wack, or something similar. Its in help civilian core, I think."

22:10 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The help file on the pilot contract talks about it in depth."

22:11 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "My fault I have others have mentioned it as paperwork.. I am sorry."

22:11 [Newbie Help] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I figured as much, just making sure they knew it's not allowed."

22:11 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "I apprecaite it.. my fault.."

22:11 [Newbie Help] Evelyn Devereaux transmits, "I even got a warnign because of you mike!\."

22:11 [Newbie Help] Mike Marshall transmits, "Again I apologize I did not know. I have otehrs mentioned it as paperwork before."

22:14 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:21 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

22:21 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

22:21 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

22:22 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

22:22 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Is there an in character version of I'm lagging really, really bad right now?"

22:22 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ignore it mostly."

22:51 Off in the distance, the volcano spews more ash into the sky. It falls down like thick snow as the platform traverses the hellscape.

22:53 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

23:04 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

23:14 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

23:15 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

23:22 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

23:22 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

23:36 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

23:52 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

23:59 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.
