00:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:58 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

00:58 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.

01:10 You are carrying nothing.

01:10 a backpack

01:10 You see nothing special.
It is open.
Inside it you see a mood ring, an advanced damage output boost, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, and a metal container.

01:11 You blink heavily and then doze off.

01:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Love. Just over here on Old Frontier setting up a site. I guess Kim nor ather were able to go for the mission just yet."

01:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:32 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:32 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]

01:32 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in particular close to hand. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
You can go down and out.

01:32 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:32 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:32 [Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Airlock]

01:32 You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:32 You exit the ship.

01:32 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:32 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:32 The ship is already moving.

01:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:32 Your ship 'Defensive Dissidence' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:32 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

01:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:32 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:32 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

01:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:32 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:32 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

01:32 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:32 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:32 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:32 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

01:33 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

01:33 AutoStar detects 12 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

01:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "?Hi love."

01:33 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:33 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:34 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:34 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

01:34 You can go out and enter into the ship.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

01:41 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

01:41 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

01:41 You smile at Lily Kaise.

01:41 Lily Kaise whispers, "You are just so awesome and so fine!"

01:42 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

01:42 Lily Kaise beams at you.

01:42 You beam at Lily Kaise.

01:42 Lily says to you, "So."

01:43 Lily Kaise says, "I heard an alert go out for Hyperion Orbit."

01:43 You say to Lily, "Oh really?"

01:43 Lily Kaise says, "I went in with Starfish. I probably should have just gone and gotten my Combat Scout."

01:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:44 Lily Kaise says, "They didn't even bother me though it was a bolt thrower and an AEU Long-Range Scout those jerks."

01:44 You say to Lily, "Oh wow. Ok. So they jumped?"

01:44 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I shot the interdicters and went to get my Scout and was about to go after the Long-Range but they jumped out because aEU Navy reinforcements jumped in. Oh well!"

01:45 You grin at Lily Kaise. "Well, good job."

01:45 Lily Kaise grins.

01:45 Lily Kaise says, "Well would have been better had I beat up something."

01:45 Lily Kaise grins at you.

01:45 You grin at Lily Kaise. "True, but I often don't even get to fire a single shot when I jump into a sector with hostile ships there."

01:46 Lily Kaise says, "Oh wow well I was surprised that they didn't jump out when I came in with the scout."

01:46 You nod to Lily Kaise.

01:46 Lily Kaise says, "Anyway, might want to check to see if Hyperion is under a siege or such."

01:47 You say, "Ok. I'll look."

01:47 You say, "Be right back."

01:47 You scramble to your feet.

01:47 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk", the three-person clipper "Obliteration", the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

01:47 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

01:47 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:47 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:47 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:47 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:47 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:47 The ship is already moving.

01:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah because there may be more fireworks later!"

01:47 The ship is already moving.

01:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:47 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:47 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:47 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:47 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:47 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:47 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

04:02 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "The outsiders have attacked us with dozens of battleships. Better to draw one to a trap and destroy it efficiently, then let it come on its own and be caught flat-footed."

04:02 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Na, a mothership is way, way bigger."

04:03 Lily Kaise tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

04:04 Lily Kaise says, "No kidding Melinda."

04:30 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Keep dreaming."

04:30 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Even a threatening I think doesn't pay 30."

04:31 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Your face looks like a failed."

04:32 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "That's what your maternal figure said last night."

04:33 Keying his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, Ather Jammoa continues coughing to clear his throat.

04:35 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Keegan Wantz, the love that I feel for you sometimes makes my bladder tingle with absolute pleasure. To the point where I end up squirming uncontrolably. It is that, among many other reasons, which just proves that our love and bond are absolutely solid and unbreakable. They will endure beyond the very thought and concept of time."

04:35 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Woo."

04:38 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

04:50 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Megacredits will soon buy command points."

04:52 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:53 Lily Kaise tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

04:54 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Woo."

04:54 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Mine is better, I'm sure."

04:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alo
12:05 ne. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

16:13 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I received a call from Melinda per the call that she made the other day and we hadn't connected again. The There's a meeting at 2230 tomorrow. Station participation is being discussed. I doubt that I can make it but Melinda said she would communicate with us regarding their decision. I indicated that we would be willing to share in the cost of the Accelerator to 285 to support our Asteroid Processor. Heh I guess the cost of the nice power plants which SEAS and Starseekers is hurting their big fat organization coffers."

16:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

16:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chuckles.

16:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, cause I thought they didn't want to include AEU on anything."

16:17 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "You know mh philosophy concerning maintaining balances of credits and Megacredits. I just prefer that we have enough to support our contributions and a couple of months in reserves. Having said that, we have much more than we need and so unless we're just throwing resources at the wind, I don't believe in hoarding resources."

16:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I do try to keep our credits going forward because we need to keep our cruisers and any other starships which we may need to support in good standing."

16:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Definitely."

16:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good afternoon."

16:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Hi."

16:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Kim."

16:22 Please enter a valid channel to transmit on.

16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Kim."

16:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok now that we have a few of us present. I just wanted to let you all know that I spoke with Melinda today. There will be a meeting tomorrow at 2230 to discuss our participation with Temporary Space stations. Initially she asked me about our involvement with the 285 Asteroid processor. She asked if we were willing to share in the e expense of the Accelerator. I said we would be willing to. Then she asked if we had plans to build Salvage or BAS stations in the typical sectors. I responded no that we only planned to place ours around Steel phoenix Command. Then she mentioned our participation in future stations. I indicated that we would be willing to work with them again."

16:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All acceptible answers!"

16:28 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

16:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good, I'm glad you approve. We'll see how it goes. Unfortunately, I likely won't be able to attend. I asked her to reach ut to me, you Ather or Kim if other input was necessary. I certainly didn't initiate this breech so I know that we were still willing to be a team player."

16:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I will definitely do my best to be present for that meeting. And I have never had a problem working with them and certainly won't have now."

16:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."

16:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "She assured me that we wouldn't be attacked. I am hopefully this didn't just imply physically but that they would conduct themselves professionally."

16:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think their decision not to work with us has rather done the opposite of what I think they intended with it. We've had to build our own salvage and BAS stations and surely our government would appreciate that more than seeing us cooperate with the other alliances."

16:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's a good point that you could in theory mention at tomorrow's meeting. I wasn't invited, so I won't be going, but invaders will do whatever. We still have a shitton of parts for the usual collections of stations."

16:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I was not technically invited either."

16:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or at least have not been invited until this point."

16:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Actually, I didn't get the impression that we weren't invited. Since I typically have takent he lead on station participation, that's why she reached out to me."

16:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, that makes sense."

16:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, if you can't make it, send a letter to either Kim or mee so we can go in your place or something. Preferably Kim if she's going to be around. A lot of these people are fucking nutcases that I'd rather not be cooped up with for a prolonged fucking period."

16:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh gee, are they that bad? Who are the worst nut cases I need to keep an eye out for?"

16:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Morris more than anyone else, to be honest. Johann isn't horrible, Melinda's OK, I don't know who else is going to be present."

16:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders giggles. "In all seriousness, I really can generally work pretty ok with everyone, so I will definitely make an effort to be there."

16:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, what am I going to do..."

16:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Long Haul". The organization has earned 392,108.16 credits.

17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I do have plenty of time today."

17:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So do i."

17:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I can go in a couple of hours."

17:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok then we'd just need one more."

17:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "If you all don't mind waiting for a couple of hours, let's see who's around then and go from there."

17:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I think that is a good idea. No sense in planning way ahead of time and then something changes."

17:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Congrats."

17:34 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

17:34 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

17:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

17:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

17:34 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

17:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

17:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

17:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

17:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

17:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:35 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Old Frontier."

17:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:35 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:35 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon B-29."

17:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

17:35 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Frontier Cluster."

17:35 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

17:35 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

17:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

17:35 Dark asteroids tumble lazily through the emptiness of space.

17:35 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

17:35 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Long Haul". The organization has earned 489,444.00 credits.

17:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:36 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

17:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

17:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

17:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow that was some good work there Alistair."

17:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

17:36 You pull a large lever towards you.

17:36 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

17:36 You peer out...

17:36 
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk", the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

17:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Absolutely!"

17:36 Constantine Stone waves.

17:36 Lily Kaise kisses you.

17:36 You kiss Lily Kaise.

17:36 You wave to Constantine Stone.

17:36 You sit down on a large leather couch.

17:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks, I need a bigger storage hold."

17:38 Constantine Stone sits down on a large leather couch.

17:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "What is the difference bewteen different phone packages?"

17:38 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Price, mostly."

17:39 Lily Kaise retrieves a virtual reality suit and puts it on.

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Voicemail nearly doubles it."

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hey Alistair, how many industry points do you actually have?"

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have everything and it costs 67 mil per month."

17:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "111."

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "So when I start up should I go outgoing? Local or full service?"

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Wow, and you are still flying a cargo hauler? I think, unless something has changed, you could get a light transport by now?"

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I vote full service plan."

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If you can afford it, full service."

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "But yes I just started out with basics initially until I could earn more income as it's not productive to work just to support owning a phone. In fact, I didn't have a phone or apartment or those kinds of fringe benefits for a couple of months."

17:42 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would go with full, that alone shouldn't be too costly."

17:43 Lily Kaise removes her virtual reality suit.

17:43 Lily Kaise retrieves a virtual reality suit and puts it on.

17:43 I don't see that here.

17:43 I don't see that here.

17:43 Lily Kaise removes her virtual reality suit.

17:43 You smile at Lily Kaise.

17:43 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

17:43 Lily Kaise sits down on a large leather couch.

17:44 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I did get a phone fairly quickly, but at first it just had the full service plan and nothing else. I was able to live with another pilot at first so that definitely made life easier on me."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I have plans to get a light transport, I treat myself to a limo so I could do some taxi'ing."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I slept in my ship for the first couple of months too."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I got very familiar with the cold, hard deck of a ship."

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

17:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb chuckles.

17:45 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I've been living in my mule for nearly a year."

17:45 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's actually really roomy."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Oh gee, well I did get a couch fairly early on for my ship."

17:45 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think I'll get an apartment at this point."

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I got a loverly yellow sleeping bag!"

17:45 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah and some real clothing!"

17:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "As long as I have my hat I'm safe."

17:46 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

17:46 I don't understand that.

17:46 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well um you need to at least wear a bottom while out in public! Trust me!"

17:46 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise chuckles.

17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb laughs.

17:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'm your jailbird expert! I forgot to get dressed um one day... out of over 4 years... and all of a sudden I was hauled off to Dure which is quite dreadful so I don't suggest encouragement to be sent there."

17:47 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

17:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

17:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ai, no. I have been visiting there and that was dreadful enough."

17:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah, prison isn't fun."

17:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'll be back in about an hour. Two hours at the most. Let's see then if we can't do that mission."

17:57 You kiss Lily Kaise.

17:57 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

17:57 You say to Lily, "See you later. I lov eyou."

17:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yep, sounds good!"

17:57 You say to Lily, "I love you."

17:57 You can't go that way.

17:57 You scramble to your feet.

17:57 [Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The vostok-class capsule "Sparklehawk", the two-person Accord gemini "Starfish", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

17:57 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

17:57 You can go out and enter into the ship.

17:57 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:57 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

17:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Woo, someone is hauling!"

17:58 You blink heavily and then doze off.

17:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah devinitely!"

17:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Later Love."

18:15 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at AEU Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "The Zilant". The organization has earned 326,414.95 credits.

18:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Did we figure out what's required for the mission? I wonder if it's space combat."

18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Huh I can just hear the going back and forth on their channels. I doubt she will engage us but at least we're willing to play."

18:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well, if she ignores our offers and then has not enough crew, it's not our fault is it?"

18:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nope not at all!"

18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much space combat do you have, Kim?"

18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "3502 space combat points."

18:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh wow, okay."

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have 9622."

18:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe you can check if you're able to get the mission some time, Alistair."

18:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you can get it I can stop worrying about raising my space combat for it."

18:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

18:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just be careful not to accept it if you try."

18:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I should think all you need is the minimum to qualify for the tier 1."

18:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How much space combat do you have, Constantine?"

18:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I don't know. When the Fringe joined the Steel Phoenix and some of them couldn't do it, I got hopeful that maybe I couldn't because my space combat was too low."

18:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it's probably just that I can't do it at all."

18:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "1561."

18:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I stopped working on it after I got enough for a cruiser, basically."

18:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Which mission is this?"

18:31 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at AEU Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "The Zilant". The organization has earned 130,776.85 credits.

18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Shouldn't because we need to keep our skills up to par for defending humanity."

18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The mission to get the turtle suit."

18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's an officer at steel phoenix command that offers a special mission that gives you access to a unique battlesuit."

18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my skills are fine, at least for doing beacons."

18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can do them in my sleep."

18:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Oh right, I still need to do some ground combat, at some point anyway."

18:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes but a willingness to perform is also in favor I should think so that is why we should continue to engage wheever necessary and possible. I have way more than I need but I just like to show a cooperative spirit."

18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I think I do do what is necessary."

18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I might have a different idea about what is necessary, though. Do I need to do 8 beacons per conquest? Probably not really, and I don't. Would I defend space whenever it gets attacked? Of course I would."

18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Alistair how much ground combat do you have so far? I think the minimum on that suit may be 300."

18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I don't need 5000 space combat points to do that."

18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't even need 1600 space combat points to do that."

18:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, my ground combat skills are not the strongest, but I have always made an effort to keep them adequate."

18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right."

18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb chuckles.

18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I need a suit."

18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, for ground combat a suit is a minimal requirement."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And I agree, you don't need to do 8 beacons each conquest. It's been rare occasions where I actually managed to do that many."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I did it back when I thought I needed the points."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Alistair there are some to get started with on Space Vermin Patrol and you need to do those as they won't be available indefinitely."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But surprise, there's really nothing you need that many points for."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "At least not right now."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm sure our pseudo-alliance with the fringe will produce some tech I also don't need."

18:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Which suit would you start with?"

18:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well if you can get a rental but I started out with our own suit, the aEU because you can repair yourself. It isn't good on armor but it's going to keep you alive if you are careful enough."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Ok, I'll add it to my todo."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I used the AEU suit all the way through low deployments until I couldn't do them anymore."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Are careful enough that is."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's perfectly fine to use instead of the rental."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Rental might be better if you want to get up to doing tesla by yourself."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Luckily they allow everyone two suit slots now."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you can always pick up both."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So did I and only exploded once!"

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also, there's a fund for new pilots to draw on for suit-related stuff."

18:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "May as well use it."

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, the AEU suit is not a bad suit, if you just watch your damage, and the low deployments are a bit challenging, but the space vermin patrol missions are really good."

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah because after you achieve a certain number of points, you won't be able to do Space Vermin missions anymore."

18:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Ok what is this fund?"

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you go to the fund center at the new phoenix space port you can access it."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think 400 ground combat, so that is a nice little while yet, where deployments on New Earth stop at 250."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Will do."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't empty it, obviously, but there's plenty enough in there to get yourself set up with a basic suit."

18:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks."

18:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also, learning Tesla is another way to earn a fair amount of credits and points and it isn't going to draw enemy until you have 250 Ground."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, she has not directly said no."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It would be a lot easier if she would."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You could just show up and see what happens."

18:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That is what I plan to do."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I just need to go back a while, got quite a few sectors out salvaging."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "She didn't seem like she was saying no, at least."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup she's basically just stonewalling but oh well."

18:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think that whole stance they took in hopes of accomplishing something is softening with a majority of them to be honest."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That would be about time too, if you ask me."

18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I just showed up on tesla one day merely to do missions and Earrache I mean what's his name slapped me. I wasn't even going to ask to participate in whatever their mission was and I didn't want to in the first place as was my first time to try out the Monk."

18:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I didn't say a word... just selected my work and moved on."

18:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, he just slapped you?"

18:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh sorry poked me guess that was the wrong word but he behaved as such."

18:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Constantine, how much would you withdraw?"

18:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I can't remember what the tier 1 suit costs. I would think 10 or 12 should be plenty to cover the suit and the modules and abilities you can get to start."

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can always get some then get more later if it was too expensive."

18:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Ok thanks."

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, they either already left, or their mission is stalling because they don't have enough people."

18:53 Your communicator reports that...

18:53 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Check the tavern place thing too."

18:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh, there you go."

18:54 The communications systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

18:59 You stand up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

18:59 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

18:59 You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:59  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

18:59 You are carrying nothing.

18:59 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:59 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

18:59 I can't find "sofa."

18:59 I don't understand that.

20:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

20:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

20:53 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

20:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So are going to dance with a Turtle or Chase a Turtle today?"

20:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I'm up for it."

21:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:08 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:08 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:08 You scramble to your feet.

You can go up and out.

21:08 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:08 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:08 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

21:09 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:09 The computer reports that the four-person mule "Daisy May" has jumped out of the sector.

21:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:09 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:14 You grin.

21:14 You say to Kim Saunders, "Have you talked to the officer at Accord yet?"

21:14 Kim Saunders says, "Now I hope I remember to put this back when I do my next salvage missions, because really I don't need quite that many industry points for myself."

21:14 Kim says to you, "No, not yet."

21:14 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah know what you mean!"

21:14 You nod.

21:14 Lily Kaise says, "I wish I oculd give all mine to the org."

21:14 You grin.

21:14 You ask, "Everyone ready?"

21:14 Kim Saunders says, "I can give 50 percent, which is more than I have ever been able to do in the past. Crazy."

21:15 Kim Saunders nods. "And I am ready."

21:15 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

21:15 Constantine Stone says, "Oh wow."

21:15 I don't understand that.

21:15 Try this instead:  hol kim in

21:15 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah well if there's only 2 active."

21:15 You hold Kim Saunders's hand, taking her into your group.

21:15 Constantine Stone asks, "Is that cause only you and Angel are active?"

21:15 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

21:15 Lily says to you, "We can stop by phoenix on the way?"

21:15 I don't understand that.

21:15 Kim Saunders says, "Angel and I are the only members, period."

21:15 You nod to Lily Kaise.

21:15 Lily Kaise nods to Kim Saunders.

21:15 Constantine Stone asks, "Whoa, what about Evangeline?"

21:15 I don't understand that.

21:15 Lily Kaise says, "We have 4 but Tara is like not at work so there's just 3 active."

21:16 You say, "Ok."

21:16 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

21:16 The two-person light transport "Salvagari Lettuce" and the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Lily Kaise, Kim Saunders, and Constantine Stone followed you.

21:16 Board what?

21:16 Kim Saunders says, "Let's rock this party before my nerves get in the way and I get second thoughts."

21:16 [Starship "Supernova"; Airlock]

21:16 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Kim Saunders, and Constantine Stone followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the aerial fortress stowed on the four-person mule "Daisy May".

21:16 Lily Kaise chuckles.

21:16 You chuckle.

21:16 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

21:16 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.
Lily Kaise, Kim Saunders, and Constantine Stone followed you.

21:16 You disband your group.

21:16 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:16 Lily Kaise says, "Oh good our suits went where they are supposed to."

21:16 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Everyone got their suit aboard?"

21:16 Kim Saunders exclaims, "Yay!"

21:16 Constantine Stone nods.

21:16 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:16 Constantine Stone walks south.

21:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Supernova, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:17 The ship is already moving.

21:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Steel Phoenix Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Steel Phoenix Command."

21:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:17 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The unusual but striking shape of the Steel Phoenix Command Station floats here, a large structure of darkened steel.

21:17 Via general sector communication, Steel Phoenix Command transmits, "Hello there, Supernova! Welcome to home space!"

21:17 AutoStar detects 1 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

21:17 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

21:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Steel Phoenix Command (Dock Alpha).

21:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:17 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:17 A voice says over the speaker, "The Steel Phoenix rises. Cleared to land."

21:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:18 You say to Kim, "Go for it. Go talk to him."

21:18 You grin at Kim Saunders.

21:18 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:18 Kim Saunders says, "Right, I'll be, right back."

21:18 Kim Saunders strides out.

21:18 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:18 Starship "Supernova" unlocked.

21:18 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

21:18 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

21:18 Lily Kaise kisses you.

21:18 You kiss Lily Kaise.

21:19 You ask, "Sheesh, do I remember how to fly?"

21:19 You laugh.

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I assume this officer is found in the command centre?"

21:19 Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, he's sort of north from the docking bays."

21:19 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah just go straight in."

21:20 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "You'll almost run into him heh."

21:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles.

21:20 You hear someone knocking calmly upon the hull.

21:20 You say into the external PA microphone, "It's unlocked."

21:20 Lily Kaise says into the external PA microphone, "Come on in."

21:20 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:20 Kim Saunders just entered the ship.

21:20 Starship "Supernova" locked.

21:20 Kim Saunders says, "I have met only one officer there, and he does not believe he can help me."

21:20 You say, "Awww."

21:20 Kim Saunders says, "Or I can help him, rather."

21:20 Lily Kaise asks, "You serious?"

21:20 You ask, "Really?"

21:20 Constantine Stone says, "Huh, that's what he says to me, too."

21:21 Lily Kaise says, "What the."

21:21 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:21 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:21 Constantine Stone says, "I wonder if you need 1800 points."

21:21 I don't understand that.

21:21 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

21:21 Lily says to you, "How much Combat do you have?"

21:21 You say, "That's weird."

21:21 Constantine Stone says, "But I'm pretty sure I have more points than Erik, and he has one."

21:21 Point Totals:

21:21   Industry:           9400.2 
  Space Combat:       7091.4 
  Ground Combat:      1925.0

Kim Saunders says, "I only have 1170 ground combat though."

21:21 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe AEU pilots can't get them anymore."

21:21 Lily Kaise says, "How about Space Combat."

21:21 Lily Kaise says, "Oh yeah you have 3500."

21:21 Kim Saunders says, "3400."

21:21 You say to Lily, "7091."

21:21 Lily Kaise says, "Or a tad more."

21:21 Kim Saunders says, "Uh, 3500."

21:21 Lily Kaise nods.

21:22 Lily Kaise says, "That is just weird."

21:22 You nod.

21:22 Lily Kaise says, "Darn."

21:22 You ask, "I wonder if we have to be grouped with her?"

21:22 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe."

21:22 Lily Kaise says, "I don't think we could try Accord because I can't get Salvage Recovery missions so."

21:22 Constantine Stone says, "May as well try."

21:22 You say to Kim, "Trying holding us."

21:22 Kim Saunders takes you into her group.

21:22 Lily Kaise says, "'yeah."

21:22 Constantine says to Lily, "But we can still get the rat suit mission."

21:22 Kim Saunders takes Lily Kaise into her group.

21:23 Constantine Stone says, "You never know, I suppose."

21:23 Kim Saunders takes Constantine Stone into her group.

21:23 Lily Kaise nods.

21:23 You follow Kim Saunders out.

21:23 [Starship "Supernova"; Airlock]
Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

21:23 You follow Kim Saunders out of the ship.

21:23 [Steel Phoenix Command Station; Command Center]
You see a Steel Phoenix officer here.
Kim Saunders is standing here.
You can go northeast and east.

21:23 Kim Saunders attempts to engage a Steel Phoenix officer in conversation.

21:23 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Hello there. No way to put this politely, but I don't believe you can be any help to me."

21:23 You frown at a Steel Phoenix officer.

21:23 Kim Saunders looks at a Steel Phoenix officer thoughtfully.

21:23 You say to Kim, "Sorry, was worht a try."

21:23 Constantine Stone says to a Steel Phoenix officer, "But we're so helpful!"

21:23 Kim Saunders says, "Yeah, we are a great team."

21:23 Lily Kaise attempts to engage a Steel Phoenix officer in conversation.

21:23 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Thanks again for your amazing work."

21:23 Lily Kaise pats a Steel Phoenix officer on the back.

21:23 Constantine Stone attempts to engage a Steel Phoenix officer in conversation.

21:23 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Hello there. No way to put this politely, but I don't believe you can be any help to me."

21:23 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:24 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder.

21:24 Lily Kaise asks, "So did either of you talk to the officer on new Earth the one who does the patrol missions?"

21:24 Kim Saunders says, "No."

21:24 Constantine Stone says, "I do the patrols regularly."

21:24 Constantine Stone says, "This is unrelated to that, I think."

21:24 Lily Kaise says, "I doubt it's related but..."

21:24 You say, "So, nothing to do with that."

21:24 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

21:24 Constantine Stone says, "I'm actually fairly confident he did deal with me a long time ago."

21:24 Constantine Stone says, "Shortly after the station went online."

21:24 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I just didn't know if even though it's not so let's try accord."

21:24 Constantine Stone says, "I wonder if an alliance can only have so many turtle suits active."

21:25 Lily Kaise says, "Naa I didn't see anything like that in the list."

21:25 You say, "I doubt that, but yeah."

21:25 Constantine Stone says, "Well, or so many thrall ship missions."

21:25 Constantine Stone says, "That way it wouldn't affect anything with the list."

21:25 Lily Kaise says, "We've only done one."

21:25 You say, "True."

21:25 Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, one mission grants the suit to everyone?"

21:25 Kim Saunders says, "I doubt we can get anything from accord, not only that apparently they have a much harder time locating the thrall and we'd be easily spending until past midnight if not longer."

21:25 Lily Kaise asks, "It was with ather and Shule and myself plus hmm was it Ted from Fringe?"

21:25 I don't understand that.

21:25 Constantine Stone says, "Try kicking me out of the group and talking to him, Kim."

21:25 Say to whom?

21:25 Constantine Stone says, "In case I'm ruining it somehow."

21:26 You say to Lily, "It was Damien."

21:26 Kim Saunders disbands her group.

21:26 Kim Saunders takes you into her group.

21:26 Kim Saunders takes Lily Kaise into her group.

21:26 Kim Saunders attempts to engage a Steel Phoenix officer in conversation.

21:26 A Steel Phoenix officer says, "Hello there. No way to put this politely, but I don't believe you can be any help to me."

21:26 Constantine Stone snaps his fingers.

21:26 Lily says to Constantine, "Just leave the group."

21:26 You say, "Nope."

21:26 Kim Saunders disbands her group.

21:26 You sigh.

21:26 You say, "Darn."

21:26 Lily Kaise says, "Wow yeah."

21:26 Kim Saunders says, "I think I will just need to work harder on my ground combat skills."

21:26 You hold Kim Saunders's hand, taking her into your group.

21:26 You hold Constantine Stone's hand, taking him into your group.

21:26 You hold Lily Kaise's hand, taking her into your group.

21:26 Lily Kaise says, "I think perhaps Ather needs to inquire for us this is really odd."

21:26 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:26 You nod.

21:27 Constantine Stone says, "Yeah, I guess it can't hurt to ask."

21:27 You can't go that way.

21:27 Lily Kaise nods.

21:27 You can't go that way.

21:27 You can't go that way.

21:27 [Steel Phoenix Command Station; Command Center]

21:27 This is the Steel Phoenix Command Center, constantly manned by black-suited technicians and uniformed Steel Phoenix officers. Mounted into the exterior bulkhead is a wide transparisteel window allowing a view out into space, with a row of manned terminals set up before it. On the opposite side is the command center's computer, a floor-to-ceiling hulk of transistors and blinking lights.
You see a Steel Phoenix officer here.
Kim Saunders, Lily Kaise, and Constantine Stone are standing here.
You can go northeast and east.

21:27 Lily Kaise asks, "So where would you find it on Accord?"

21:27 [Steel Phoenix Command Station; Dock Alpha]

21:27 The four-person Accord space module transport "SEAS Spare Parts" and the eight-person soothsayer mark two "Supernova" are landed here.
You can go east, southwest, west, and northwest.
Kim Saunders, Constantine Stone, and Lily Kaise followed you.

21:27 Constantine Stone says, "I don't think I have more than an hour to spend on this, unfortunately."

21:27 Constantine Stone says, "If doing it through Accord takes longer I may not be able to."

21:27 Kim Saunders asks, "Why don't we just do something else together?"

21:27 Constantine Stone says, "Assuming we even can."

21:27 Constantine Stone nods.

21:28 [Starship "Supernova"; Airlock]

21:28 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Kim Saunders, Constantine Stone, and Lily Kaise followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

21:28 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

21:28 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.
Kim Saunders, Constantine Stone, and Lily Kaise followed you.

21:28 Lily Kaise says, "Well we could hmm."

21:28 Lily Kaise says, "I'm not a fancier of high tier nests."

21:28 You say to Kim Saunders, "Sorry Kim."

21:28 Kim Saunders says to you, "Not your fault."

21:28 Lily Kaise says, "We could go back and go down to tier 3."

21:28 You say, "I don't trust myself to lead on a high tier nest."

21:29 Lily Kaise says, "That is why I said let's go back and switch out to tier 3."

21:29 You say, "Oh, ok."

21:29 Lily Kaise grins.

21:29 Kim Saunders says, "Yeah, we can do that."

21:29 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:29 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:29 Constantine Stone says, "I only have AEU in tier 3."

21:29 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

21:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:29 Kim Saunders says, "Or some space combat, that would help with conquest even more."

21:29 Lily Kaise says, "I'd suggest a megapod too as I know we al need our scout missions."

21:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:29 You say to Lily, "Can you lead with a tier 3 turtle suit?"

21:29 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

21:29 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:29 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:29 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:29 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 420" has launched from New Earth.

21:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Supernova! Welcome to home space!"

21:29 Lily Kaise asks, "I can try but why not you?"

21:29 Kim Saunders says, "Ooh yeah, that might work too."

21:30 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 420" has jumped out of the sector.

21:30 You say to Lily, "I don't have one set up."

21:30 You grin.

21:30 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

21:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:30 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

21:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Supernova. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

21:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:30 You chuckle.

21:30 You disband your group.

21:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

21:30 Constantine Stone walks out.

21:31 Kim Saunders asks, "You want me in my EAOS, or a repair thing?"

21:31 Lily Kaise says, "Let me undock the mule."

21:32 Your ship 'Supernova' has been automatically moved into a garage.

21:32 Kim Saunders gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "I am confused."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Thought we were doing a nest? I didn't get confirmation about a megapod."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Well, I was thinking nest, but we could do a megapod too."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm down for either."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am down for either as well."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh hell, why not a megapod. A scout mission? I've never done one so..."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I haven't done a megapod... just only 1 ever so we might all die! but we can try and with that we'll need two EAOS and an aEU."

21:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise laughs.

21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire laughs.

21:34 Kim Saunders keys her red metachannel FTL communicator:

21:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok will get out the bruiser."

Star Conquest Help: Megapod Raids
--
Category: Activities
--
The 'megapod' is a massive Bari infestation (see the Bari help file) of the EAOS Experimental Research Structure, which was abandoned during the Outsider War. An IFS attack several years later catastrophically breached the structure, allowing the Bari access to space. Given the EAOS's penchant for tinkering and genetic engineering, the full extent of the infestation and the nature of the creatures inhabiting the megapod is unknown.

However, you and your fellow civilian pilots can help to uncover the mysteries of the megapod. Through a series of scouting missions, assaults, and raids, you can penetrate ever deeper into the megapod and, with a little luck, even recover some pre-War EAOS technology. To participate, deploy an aerial fortress to the Experimental Research Structure.

Here are the available megapod missions, ordered by difficulty. Missions are not all linear, and sometimes your party will have a choice of where to go. Greater danger often brings greater rewards! One megapod mission may be completed for full loot and credit per Conquest period. You may also do additional raids per Conquest period at your current level or lower, perhaps to help others, but they will credit you and the mission will not generate a loot item for you.

SCOUT THE MEGAPOD

A scouting mission ventures just a short distance into one of the megapod's many exterior entra
21:38 nces. By exploring these top level tunnels, you can find ways to move deeper into the megapod.

Recommended Party Size: 5

SHALLOW ASSAULT

Move beyond the entry area of the megapod and see what is brewing just below the surface.

Requirements: Five scouting missions completed by every would-be participant.

Recommended Party Size: 5

DEEP ASSAULT

Move much deeper into the megapod and into more well-developed and dangerous nests of Bari.

Requirements: Five shallow assault missions completed by every would-be participant.

Recommended Party Size: 5

More missions will come in the future!

21:43 You see a small yellow ball containing some rattling beads, a silky purple cushion decorated with embroidered pale purple lotus blossoms, a large oval white and light yellow cloth rug, a glossy gold ceramic felo chow bowl, and Emmylou the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

21:43 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

21:43 Lily Kaise's group just entered the ship.

21:43 Constantine Stone walks south.

21:43 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

21:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:43 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:43 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Daisy May, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:43 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:43 You say to Lily Kaise, "YEah, thought we were doing a megapod."

21:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:44 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heck I don't know anyore!"

21:44 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:44 Lily Kaise asks, "Is it dusty we go to?"

21:45 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

21:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Toroidal Dust Cloud. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

21:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:45 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

21:45 Kim Saunders says, "We are all gonna die."

21:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:45 None of the dust in this area seems to be any kind of valuable salvage, but it does do an excellent job of blocking light and sensor readings.

21:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:45 Via general sector communication, Experimental Research Structure transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Daisy May.' Welcome to Toroidal Dust Cloud."

21:45 You laugh.

21:45 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

22:12 [Starship "Daisy May"; Docking Bay]

22:12 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a sleeping octarine soldier felo, and the aerial fortress and deployment station "Petunia" here.
You can go up.

22:12 You can't go that way.

22:12 [Starship "Daisy May"; Main Deck]

22:12 You see a crudely hammered scrap metal feeding trough, a felo nest, a small purple ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a sleeping normal white soldier felo kitten, a sleeping average-sized red felo, a sleeping normal octarine soldier felo, an old sleeping big octarine soldier felo, a small octarine soldier felo, and an octarine soldier felo kitten here.
Kim Saunders is standing here.

Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go south and out.

22:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:12 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:12 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:12 Kim Saunders's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We should probably set up for something simpler to do, that might not take so long?"

22:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:12 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:12 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Daisy May! Welcome to home space!"

22:12 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

22:12 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

22:12 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

22:12 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Ok I just suggest we all exit and come back and hopefully that will clear up the confusion!"

22:12 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

22:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:12 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:13 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Daisy May. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:13 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:13 Kim Saunders strides in from the south.

22:13 [Starship "Daisy May"; Airlock]

22:13 You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Maybe I have it resolved."

23:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok. I hope you do. Did you try what I suggested?"

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup it's fixed I had to switch to a new slot, then switch to the fringe, then board and exit and it went to the landing pad and then I was able to switch to a different slot. What a mess!"

23:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah ok."

23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I was trying to help you, but I'm glad you got it figured out."

23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I was trying to give you suggestions though."

23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I tried just that same thing earlier and I t didn't resolve."

23:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah ok."
