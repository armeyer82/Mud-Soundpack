02:08:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Gah... come off of it. I just get nicely into a Low deployment.. and they start stuff."

02:08:16 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.

02:08:16 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:08:21 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

02:08:22 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

02:08:32 The one-person cargo hauler "Grace" touches down smoothly on the ground.

02:08:33 The reactionless drive of the one-person cargo hauler "Grace" ceases its faint hum as the starship is powered down.

02:08:34 Rahab Cassidy exits from the one-person cargo hauler "Grace".

02:08:52 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:08:52 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:08:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:08:56 [Tactical Communication] Combat Pilot Erik Goodwin transmits, "We've got 5 here."

02:08:58 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:08:58 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:09:08 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:09:09 [Tactical Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "I can help with that if you'd like."

02:09:22 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Come to New Earth and we'll grab a cruiser."

02:09:47 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:10:03 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:10:04 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.

02:19:56 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

02:19:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

02:20:42 Rahab Cassidy mosies up.

02:20:48 [Starship "Supernova"; Airlock]

02:20:48 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:20:49 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

02:20:49 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

02:20:53 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident, Bryan Stout, Joel Kringle, Erik Goodwin, and Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah.

02:20:53 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:21:00 Not ejected.

02:21:08 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

02:21:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

02:21:24 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:21:27 You chuckle.

02:21:29 Erik Goodwin says, "She's in the lounge dumby."

02:21:30 Joel Kringle says, "She's probably outside."

02:21:33 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah chortles.

02:21:33 Bryan Stout sighs.

02:21:34 Bryan Stout's group ambles out.

02:22:09 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "1 more for pincers, 3 more for cruisers. Takers?"

02:22:10 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident.

02:22:10 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:22:15 [Tactical Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Missions that is."

02:22:23 Not ejected.

02:22:33 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah hell, why not. I'll join."

02:22:39 [Starship "Supernova"; Airlock]

02:22:39 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:22:40 You exit the ship.

02:22:40 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

02:22:45 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

02:22:45 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, Cloak the security hoverbot, Dagger the security hoverbot, and a sanitation drone here.
Chase Marshall is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch. Katina Faye, Bryan Stout, Joel Kringle, Erik Goodwin, and Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah are standing here.
You can go out.

02:22:57 Chase Marshall says, "Yea."

02:22:58 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah chuckles. "He said yes before."

02:22:59 Bryan Stout says, "I thought CHase didn't have long."

02:23:01 Chase Marshall stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

02:23:11 Katina Faye stretches.

02:23:12 Erik Goodwin says, "Cruiser then."

02:23:13 Chase Marshall says, "But."

02:23:16 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

02:23:17 Chase Marshall says, "Order came from above."

02:23:18 Erik Goodwin says, "I will go get it."

02:23:18 Joel Kringle says, "Butts are nice."

02:23:21 Bryan Stout says, "Grab mine."

02:23:22 You chuckle.

02:23:24 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah chuckles at Chase Marshall.

02:23:25 Bryan Stout says, "Oh."

02:23:25 Joel Kringle laughs.

02:23:32 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:23:33 Erik says to Bryan, "Mine has a repairbot."

02:23:41 Chase Marshall says, "Repairbutts."

02:23:47 Bryan Stout says, "Well aren't you hot shit."

02:23:49 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:23:52 Erik Goodwin says, "I also haven't used it inforever and want to use it."

02:23:52 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 903" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

02:23:53 Bryan Stout says, "Go get it then."

02:23:55 Erik Goodwin meanders out.

02:23:56 Joel Kringle says, "He would be if he had the loaderbot too."

02:24:03 You feel a faint rumbling and look up just in time to see the six-person pincer "The Wolves Have Claws" lift off the landing pad and head into space.

02:24:14 You grin.

02:24:15 Chase Marshall says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "I will only participate if you let me use heavy weapons all the time except for adapas."

02:24:22 Bryan Stout says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Last time I used my cruiser was in like May."

02:24:24 Joel Kringle chuckles.

02:24:27 Keying his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, Bryan Stout chortles.

02:24:28 Joel Kringle pats Chase Marshall on the back.

02:24:28 I don't understand that.

02:24:45 Joel Kringle says into his sleek platinum communicator watch with sapphire accents, "I'll only go if I can gun topless."

02:24:47 Chase Marshall says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Last time I used my cruiser... wait I don't even have one."

02:24:52 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

02:24:52 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah grins at Chase Marshall. "Just don't fully drain your grid and I could care less if you wanna use all the plasma you want."

02:25:05 Bryan Stout says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "That's good. I'll use your cruiser, too."

02:25:05 Chase says to Evenia, "Sure mam! You got it!"

02:25:11 Katina Faye takes a bite of a warm chocolate chip muffin.

02:25:12 You ask, "Last time I usedmy cruiserr was forever ago, wait didn't we just use someone's cruiser?"

02:25:14 Bryan Stout says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Up and down and side to side."

02:25:15 Katina Faye finishes off a warm chocolate chip muffin.

02:25:16 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:25:20 Chase Marshall says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Hot."

02:25:21 Joel Kringle says, "I don't even know what a grid is."

02:25:21 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

02:25:31 Bryan Stout says, "I forget grid."

02:25:31 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ok...anybody not doin missions that would like beacons?"

02:25:32 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah chuckles at Joel Kringle. "No, you don't. Yours is always fucking empty."

02:25:35 Bryan Stout frowns.

02:25:36 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Get me another muffin please?"

02:25:37 Joel Kringle smirks at Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah.

02:25:40 Bryan Stout frowns at an ice blue metachannel FTL communicator.

02:25:45 Joel Kringle says, "Hey I keep enough to do stuff with."

02:25:51 Chase Marshall speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator:

02:25:52 [Tactical Communication] Chase Marshall transmits, "We have not launched yet."

02:26:02 Bryan says to Chase, "Thanks."

02:26:10 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Think we have one spot possibly."

02:26:16 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Last I counted."

02:26:16 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

02:26:17 Joel Kringle says, "If we don't he can have mine."

02:26:25 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah sighs. "I want missions, not beacons."

02:26:26 Bryan Stout says, "We do. And no, you're coming."

02:26:34 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah says, "I miss bryan missions. This rocks."

02:26:35 Bryan Stout says, "We're doing missions."

02:26:37 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah grins at Bryan Stout.

02:26:46 You exclaim, "Missions are fun!"

02:26:46 A flash of movement out of the corner of your eye brings your attention to the eight-person prime defense mark two "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight" as it settles down upon the nearby landing pad.

02:26:46 Bryan Stout says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "What."

02:26:48 Erik Goodwin just arrived.

02:26:48 Joel Kringle says, "Whatever the fuck that means."

02:26:53 Chase Marshall says, "Bryan missions? More like sleep all time."

02:26:56 Joel Kringle says, "Nah."

02:26:59 Erik Goodwin says to Joel, "We go with it."

02:27:03 Erik Goodwin takes control of Bryan Stout's group.

02:27:16 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wait..."

02:27:18 Chase Marshall says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "He left us."

02:27:26 Chase Marshall says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "Stranded."

02:27:31 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Think you forgot a couple of us."

02:27:35 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sorry."

02:27:36 Chase Marshall says into his metachannel FTL communicator, "And hopeless."

02:27:37 You laugh.

02:27:55 Chase Marshall marches in from the south.

02:27:55 Bryan Stout leaves Erik Goodwin's group.

02:27:55 Erik Goodwin uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:27:56 Bryan Stout takes control of Erik Goodwin's group.

02:27:57 Chase Marshall says, "Sorry."

02:28:00 Bryan Stout says, "Whoops."

02:28:00 You grin.

02:28:00 Joel Kringle says, "What a shit show."

02:28:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight, you are given launch clearance under the League-AEU non-aggression pact."

02:28:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:28:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:28:11 Erik Goodwin presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:28:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:28:11 Katina Faye wanders in from the south.

02:28:12 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:28:14 Katina Faye sits down on Joel Kringle's lap.

02:28:14 Bryan Stout says, "Oh I guess we don't leave."

02:28:15 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:28:15 Bryan Stout nods.

02:28:17 Bryan Stout sits down.

02:28:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:28:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:28:18 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
Joel Kringle says, "Make sure everyone is together now."

02:28:19 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

02:28:20 You sit down.

02:28:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:28:24 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Remnants of Grenwold."

02:28:25 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:28:26 Erik Goodwin says, "As long as not everyone is grabbing at controls we're good."

02:28:27 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:28:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:28:29 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:28:30 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

02:28:30 Chase says to Bryan, "Me me me me."

02:28:30 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:28:33 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:28:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:28:34 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:28:34 Erik Goodwin presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:28:35 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock One).

02:28:35 Bryan Stout says, "Grab me then."

02:28:36 You stand up.

02:28:36 Joel Kringle tickles Katina Faye!

02:28:36 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight. Welcome to Accord space."

02:28:37 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:28:42 Erik Goodwin leaves Bryan Stout's group.

02:28:43 Erik Goodwin takes control of Bryan Stout's group.

02:28:44 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah stands up.

02:28:53 Erik Goodwin holds Joel Kringle's hand, taking him into his group.

02:28:57 Joel Kringle gives Erik Goodwin a thumbs up!

02:29:01 Expert Engineer Evenia Callseah says, "All the holding. I feel very held."

02:29:02 Erik Goodwin holds Chase Marshall's hand, taking him into his group.

02:29:02 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:29:07 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

02:29:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:29:15 Joel Kringle says, "I usually use to hands for a more secure and firm grip."

02:29:15 Erik says to Evenia, "I will double hold you."

02:29:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:30:06 [Starship "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight"; Control Room]

02:30:06 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 452", the four-person mule "That One Final Straw", and the eight-person prime defense mark two "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a sanitation drone, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.

02:54:53 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:22:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:22:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

03:22:30 Via general sector communication, Earthgate transmits, "Hello there, I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight! Welcome to home space!"

03:22:32 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:22:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:22:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:22:46 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:22:47 Erik Goodwin says into the PA microphone, "I swear I'm awake now."

03:22:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:22:49 Erik Goodwin stands up from a black leather captain's chair.

03:22:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:22:50 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

03:22:51 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:22:51 Katina Faye's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Stop mocking me."

03:22:52 You sit down.

03:22:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:22:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:22:54 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:22:54 Erik Goodwin says into the PA microphone, "I didn't just jump to earth. Probably."

03:22:55 You stand up.

03:22:57 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight. Welcome to Accord space."

03:22:59 Erik Goodwin presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:23:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock Two).

03:23:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:23:08 Erik Goodwin says into the PA microphone, "To the control room."

03:23:10 Evenia Callseah says, "I'm training these hoverbots to shoot turrets."

03:23:13 Joel Kringle stands up.

03:23:14 Joel Kringle chuckles.

03:23:17 You're already standing.

03:23:17 Erik Goodwin grins.

03:23:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:23:21 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

03:23:26 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

03:23:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

03:23:27 Erik Goodwin holds Joel Kringle's hand, taking him into his group.

03:26:11 Erik Goodwin says, "What."

03:26:12 Erik Goodwin says, "I didn't do it."

03:26:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight. We read your League transponder. You are cleared to land."

03:26:16 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:26:16 Joel Kringle pats Katina Faye on the back.

03:26:19 Joel Kringle strolls out.

03:26:19 Chase Marshall says, "It was outsiders."

03:27:29 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

03:27:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:27:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:27:32 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

03:27:33 Erik Goodwin presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

03:27:33 Erik Goodwin struggles to see around Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident as he works with a nearby control panel.
(12 seconds roundtime.)
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

03:27:34 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

03:27:34 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, This Ship Had A Name But Vengeful Spirits Stole It! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

03:27:36 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:27:42 Chase Marshall presses some buttons on the communication board.

03:27:43 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Hi AEU."

03:27:55 There are no other ships in the sector.

03:28:11 Erik Goodwin says into his blue metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "There were just missions, nothing else as far as I know."

03:28:14 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:28:15 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

03:28:19 Chase Marshall says, "Thank erik."

03:28:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be a League ship, This Ship Had A Name But Vengeful Spirits Stole It. The AEU welcomes you to the city of New Phoenix under the non-aggression pact."

03:28:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:28:21 Erik Goodwin says, "Sure."

03:28:24 You say, "Thanks."

03:28:25 You wave.

03:28:29 [Starship "This Ship Had A Name But Vengeful Spirits Stole It"; Airlock]

03:28:30 You can go out and enter into the ship.
The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:28:30 You exit the ship.

03:39:49 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

03:39:49 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Gamma.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

05:51:35 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

05:51:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:51:39 The computer reports that the two-person Accord gemini "Rift Surfer The Legend Continues" has jumped into the sector.

05:51:42 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

05:51:42 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Rift Surfer The Legend Continues! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

05:51:43 You say, "Ugh."

05:51:48 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Ships."

05:51:51 Starships In Sector:

05:51:52 
Rift Surfer The Legend Continues........(2, 5, 12)
The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

05:51:55 [Tactical Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Are in space generally."

05:51:57 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

05:51:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

05:52:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

05:52:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is already in your group.

05:52:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They go by Merry Band now, I think ever since they joined the Tandem pact."

05:52:13 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

05:52:13 You pull a large lever towards you.

05:52:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

05:52:14 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

05:52:15 You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

05:52:15 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 302", the two-person flare "Deadly Strike", and the two-person Accord gemini "Rift Surfer The Legend Continues" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

05:52:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oh."

05:52:21 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

05:52:21 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

05:52:22 I don't understand that.

05:52:24 The two-person Accord gemini "Rift Surfer The Legend Continues" touches down smoothly on the ground.

05:52:25 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

05:52:25 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a shiny chrome trash bin here.
Chase Marshall is sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

05:52:45 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

05:52:51 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Anyone coming to help me chase them out? I need to leave soon."

05:53:10 Joel Kringle just arrived.

05:53:10 You say to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, "Sorry hun."

05:53:14 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I know cilicone avatar is a thre person gunboat."

05:53:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Joel Kringle.

05:53:20 Joel Kringle gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

05:53:20 You hold Joel Kringle's hand, taking him into your group.

05:53:21 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

05:53:22 Joel Kringle says, "I'm down to go."

05:53:25 You say, "Ok."

05:53:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well need to do what we need to."

05:53:30 You say to Chase Marshall, "You?"

05:53:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

05:53:47 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

05:53:47 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 302" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and Joel Kringle followed you.

05:53:51 You key in a transport of Critical Strike to your location.

05:53:51 The five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and Joel Kringle followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

05:53:53 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

05:53:53 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident and Joel Kringle followed you.

05:53:58 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Launching."

05:53:59 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

05:53:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

05:54:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

05:54:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

05:54:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

05:54:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

05:54:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

05:54:20 Which sector did you mean?

05:54:20 
[1] The Shoulder of Orion (Unclaimed)
[2] The Belt of Orion (Unclaimed)

Enter your selection:

05:54:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

05:54:22 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:54:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

05:54:25 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:54:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:54:33 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:54:33 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: ^T9l^fb,>Ki%^?NnM/+ZKkJ#O(Y$afFSBxwte|ER
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:54:33 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You didn't group them."

05:54:33 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

05:54:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:54:37 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:54:37 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:54:38 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:54:39 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

05:54:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:54:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:54:42 There are no other ships in the sector.

05:54:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

05:54:43 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

05:54:44 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
Joel Kringle is standing here.
You can go south and out.
The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

05:54:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

05:54:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

05:54:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

05:54:48 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

05:54:51 Via general sector communication, League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2908 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northeast and Slightly Up."

05:54:51 Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Critical Strike.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."

05:54:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You didn't bring the others?"

05:54:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I got Joel."

05:55:11 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I didn't think Chase responded. Did I miss it?"

05:55:18 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:55:21 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

05:55:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

05:55:23 Joel Kringle says, "I don't think you missed it."

05:55:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not sure but he was there."

05:55:29 You say, "Ok."

05:55:30 Joel Kringle shrugs.

05:55:32 This rift accelerator requires paying a toll of 7,000,000.00 EAOS credits. Do you wish to pay this?

05:55:32 [Enter `yes' or `no']

05:55:34 You transfer a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

05:55:34 The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

05:55:34 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:55:39 Joel Kringle rubs his hands together vigorously.

05:55:41 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Joel sayshe didn't respond."

05:55:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

05:55:44 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:55:44 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:55:45 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:55:48 Joel Kringle says, "If nothing else Evangeline can hop in this ship."

05:55:48 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:55:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

05:55:54 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

05:55:55 You nod.

05:55:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Eek."

05:56:00 Joel Kringle says, "Whooooa."

05:56:01 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

05:56:20 Joel Kringle strolls south.

05:56:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "At least flow isn't terrible."

05:56:33 Joel Kringle's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I love the plaques."

05:56:39 Joel Kringle's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They're a great reminder."

05:56:41 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Thanks."

05:56:46 Joel Kringle strolls in from the south.

05:56:47 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "And I still have to remind people."

05:56:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says into the PA microphone, "I think they should all be protest plaques."

05:56:50 You laugh into the PA microphone.

05:56:56 Joel Kringle chuckles.

05:57:01 Joel Kringle says, "People are thick."

05:57:06 You chuckle.

05:57:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs. "Yeah."

05:57:18 Joel Kringle says, "I know I forget at first depending if it's the ship I'm used to being in or not."

05:57:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

05:57:23 You nod.

05:57:37 Lily says to Joel, "I still have your cores do you have room in your warehouse?"

05:57:42 Joel Kringle says, "I do."

05:57:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok I'll bring them back to you so they won't just sit there."

05:57:58 Joel Kringle says, "I can grab them from you after this is done if you want."

06:03:45 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "One minute."

06:03:48 You lift a small plastic cover and press a red button.

06:03:49 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights flash overhead as the ship enters red alert.

06:03:49 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

06:03:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides south.

06:03:55 Joel Kringle strolls south.

06:04:03 You can't do that here.

06:04:08 Joel Kringle strolls in from the south.

06:04:12 Joel Kringle says, "Oh I got all exited."

06:04:13 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ok, I'm still just sitting on the repair station."

06:04:18 Joel Kringle says, "Excited even."

06:04:18 You say, "Oh."

06:04:19 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

06:04:20 Joel Kringle chuckles.

06:04:23 You chuckle.

06:04:28 Wait until the ship stops moving first.

06:04:35 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:04:35 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."
The computer reports that the one-person fighter "Platinum Blond" has jumped out of the sector.
The computer reports that the two-person bolt thrower "How About We Just Hug This Out" has jumped out of the sector.
The computer reports that the one-person fighter "Baby, I'll Show You A REAL 'Cruisergate' If You Know What I Mean" has jumped out of the sector.

06:04:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: League Repairing Battery-Powered Long-Range Watchtower.

06:05:00 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:05:01 Joel Kringle presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

06:05:08 Joel Kringle says, "Interdictors at least."

06:05:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What class is it?"

06:05:10 There are no other ships in the sector.

06:05:12 You say, "Yeah."

06:05:18 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Nope, they all jumped out."

06:05:19 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

06:05:20 There are no other ships in the sector.

06:05:25 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

06:05:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh I guess I saw the last one."

06:05:27 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
You begin the docking sequence.

06:05:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

06:05:41 You peer out...

06:05:41 
[League Repairing Battery-Powered Long-Range Watchtower; Docking Bay]
A small, basic docking bay is the core of the station, along with the life support system and resource storage. Small hatches lead to the other station modules.
The two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lost In Paradise" and the five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" are parked here.
You can go north, east, south, up, and down.

06:05:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

06:05:49 A loud klaxon sounds and red lights continue flashing.

06:05:55 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They all jumped out.Just going after interdictors."

06:08:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

06:08:37 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "285 clear."

06:08:40 You lift a small plastic cover and press a green button.

06:08:41 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.
A low hum you had barely noticed until now slowly fades away as weapons are powered down.

06:08:44 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "See ya"

06:08:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides in from the south.

06:08:52 The computer announces, "Setting course to Home Beacon Alpha 286. Local rift accelerator with matching vector found."

06:08:52 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

06:08:52 Via general sector communication, Lost In Paradise transmits a text-based transmission: "See ya"

06:09:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a black leather sofa.

06:09:01 The computer reports that the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Lost In Paradise" has entered the riftflow.

06:09:02 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

06:09:02 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:09:12 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

06:09:13 You sit down on a black leather sofa.

06:09:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

06:09:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Haha ants."

06:09:38 You chuckle.

06:09:39 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

06:09:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a black leather sofa.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a black leather sofa.)

06:09:41 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

06:10:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Morris absolutely freaks over those."

06:10:13 Joel Kringle strolls in from the south.

06:10:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

06:10:17 Joel Kringle sits down on a black leather sofa.

06:10:19 Joel Kringle says, "Sick."

06:10:22 Joel Kringle says, "That was pretty good."

06:10:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "For real."

06:10:33 You grin.

06:10:47 Joel Kringle sniffs at himself.

06:10:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

06:10:56 You say, "I didn't do it."

06:10:56 Joel Kringle says, "Nope. It wasn't my odor."

06:10:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

06:10:59 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:11:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident absently sniffs at the air.

06:11:05 You laugh.

06:11:10 Joel Kringle absently sniffs at the air.

06:11:13 You sniff absently at the air.

06:11:18 Joel Kringle gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

06:11:27 Joel Kringle says, "Better than it smelling like farts honestly."

06:11:31 You say, "It was probably my ugly face that scared them off."

06:11:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

06:11:47 Joel Kringle gives you a thumbs up! "Gotta put that mug only a mother could love to work bruh."

06:11:51 Joel Kringle pats you on the back.

06:11:52 You laugh.

06:11:58 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:14:09 You say to Joel, "Don't make me have to make you walk home."

06:14:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh."

06:14:28 Joel beeps under his breath.

06:14:40 You say to Joel, "Still heard that."

06:14:44 Joel Kringle sighs.

06:14:47 You smirk.

06:14:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "That's better than hours of bip!"

06:14:48 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:14:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

06:14:49 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:14:50 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:14:51 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

06:14:52 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

06:14:52 The computer announces, "Autotravel destination reached."

06:14:53 The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

06:14:55 There are no other ships in the sector.

06:14:55 Via general sector communication, League Passively Beaconed Battery-Powered Autonav Station transmits, "Greetings. There is a sector within the standard beacon network towards Galactic East."

06:14:57 You make a selection on the AutoVector control board.

06:14:58 Joel Kringle chuckles.

06:15:00 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

06:15:06 You chuckle.

06:15:14 Joel Kringle gives you 3,500,000.00 EAOS credits.

06:15:23 You say, "Oh, thanks."

06:15:28 The starship transitions into another sector.

06:15:29 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

06:15:31 Via general sector communication, League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station transmits, "Current riftflow conditions are 2853 light-minutes per second from Galactic Northeast and Slightly Up."

06:15:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

06:15:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:15:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

06:15:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:15:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

06:15:38 You ask, "But what for?"

06:15:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

06:15:39 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

06:15:39 Joel Kringle says, "Of course."

06:15:40 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

06:15:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

06:16:09 Joel Kringle stands up from a black leather sofa.

06:16:18 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 302" has jumped into the sector.

06:16:19 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

06:16:19 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

06:16:21 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

06:16:21 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 302! Welcome to New Earth Orbit!"

06:16:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Critical Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

06:16:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

06:16:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a black leather sofa.

06:16:33 You say to Lily, "Going to check my terminal one more time."

06:16:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

06:16:36 Joel Kringle says, "It was a pleasure."

06:16:38 Joel Kringle waves frantically!

06:16:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident joins your group.
You wave to Joel Kringle.

06:16:40 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

14:47:55 New Minor Changes:

14:47:55 
-----
Fixed an issue where mission-granting NPCs would mysteriously and erratically run out of missions permanently.
   Posted 10 hours, 29 minutes, and 22 seconds ago
-----
Warehouses can now repeat the last withdrawal action performed. It'll first try to go for exact matches for contributors, but if there are no valid parts remaining, it'll ask if it's okay to use the same module, but with different contributors, if one exists in the warehouse.
   Posted 7 hours, 59 minutes, and 55 seconds ago
-----
Fixed an exploit where special mining sites could be reliably attained by repeatedly ending and restarting a site. When we ask people to report issues with a new system, this is the sort of thing we mean!

15:01:53 The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

15:01:54 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:01:54 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

15:01:55 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:01:55 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:01:56 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

15:02:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

15:02:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:02:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:02:53 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

15:02:53 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

15:02:59 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

15:03:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

15:03:00 Once a valuable source for raw materials on the edge of Known Space, this area is now fully mapped and lined with beacons.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

15:03:14 Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

15:03:14 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

15:03:16 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

15:03:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

15:03:48 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

15:03:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

15:03:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

15:04:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

15:04:03 You pull a large lever towards you.

15:04:04 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

15:04:05 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

15:04:05 You can go out and enter into the ship.

15:04:05 You exit the ship.
[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove", the one-person flitter "The Jackal", and the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

15:04:06 [Old Frontier Processor; Asteroid Mining]

15:04:07 You see a large leather couch, a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt, and a small natural golden brown trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a large leather couch.
You can go north.

15:04:12 You sit down on a large leather couch.

15:04:13 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

15:04:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

15:04:25 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:06:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No kim's comments were on the Exploration board and of course she totally didn't understand what I posted. I'm still glad that Johann postponed the trip and i'm not sure that we're ready yet as we still don't know what's going on with Outccord."

15:08:30 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:09:05 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:09:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

15:24:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're almost to that first performance goal! Let's keep pushing!"

15:29:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:31:28 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/General.

15:40:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is not possible... Jonathan, Gray? Wow!"

15:40:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Ello."

15:43:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That report was definitely inaccurate. I eyeballed several navy ships get shot down. I wonder why it wasn't reported."

15:44:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

15:44:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I observed several Navy losses as well."

15:45:56 Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.

15:46:18 Ather Jammoa removes a black flip einrophone from a black leather phone holster.

15:46:36 Ather Jammoa punches a number into a black flip einrophone.

15:46:55 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

15:46:55 Ather Jammoa says, "Hi. I sitll want to go asteroid hauling out of comms, but I am waiting for my site to finish. Once it is, I'll give you a buzz."

15:47:03 Ather Jammoa speaks into his black flip einrophone:

15:47:04 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Laters!"

15:47:12 Ather Jammoa places a black flip einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

15:58:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow you jerks."

15:58:42 Ather Jammoa removes a letter from a midnight blue backpack.

15:58:48 Ather Jammoa crumples up his letter and throws it in a nearby garbage can.

16:01:44 Ather Jammoa says, "Oh, right."

16:02:17 Ather says to you, "You do know that the shift into another unit happens seconds before the ship stops moving, right?"

16:25:39 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

16:25:49 "Yeah, I do." You nod to Ather Jammoa. "I watched my tracking information update immediately prior to the League cruiser locking on me."

16:40:31 You say to Ather, "A few seconds after the League curiser locked on me, the ship came to a stop and immediately afterwords that, we got hit."

16:41:07 Ather Jammoa nods. "Basically from what you're saying to me is they locked onto the new coordinates that you went to, and just fired off without looking."

16:41:15 Ather Jammoa gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

16:41:55 You nod to Ather Jammoa.

16:42:08 Ather Jammoa says, "You didn't happen to move into a set of coordinates where an enemy ship was, did you? Unfortunately, the tracking system tends to not be very detailed when it locks onto a ship. All it displays is "Target: Starship". That's as vague as you can possibly get."

16:42:47 Ather Jammoa chuckles. "It doesn't say what kind of starship until it's too late and the firing sequence is engaged."

16:42:54 You say, "That's what it looks like to me.'True true."

16:43:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I've had that happen and checking the tracking info doesn't help there."

16:43:41 Ather nods thoughtfully and says, "we'll call it an accidental firing for now. Morris is definitely an ass, but well, that's nothing new.

16:43:48 You nod to Ather Jammoa.

16:43:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident absently bobs her head up and down like a space parakeet.

16:44:57 You ask, "Ok. I'll write back to Nissi apologizing for my over reaction and just say that we considered it an acidental firing and we'll look into it in more detail before letters like that are sent to the League, that work?"

16:45:12 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah."

16:45:31 Ather Jammoa says, "Always look into these things as good as you possibly can. Especially in these tense times."

16:45:38 You nod.

16:45:42 You say, "I will."

16:45:53 Ather Jammoa says, "The government won't hesitate to turn an accidental firing into a declaration of war if something like this gets out."

16:46:18 You nod. "I understand."

16:47:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh wow I didn't think they would react that swiftly so it's good to know. They do need to work with their pilots to be certain they odn't fire upon the Navy and Peacekeepers out there too."

16:48:27 Ather Jammoa says, "Not the league government, our government."

16:48:29 You say, "Yeah, that's tough though. We're lucky that we didn't fire on our navy during the two waves that attacked B-24."

16:48:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

16:49:38 You say, "Heck, I was almost certain that we would accidentally fire on Ather's ship. Glad we didn't though."

16:49:57 Ather Jammoa says, "I was firing off grand bolts."

16:50:02 You grin.

16:52:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah they were lobbing plenty of bolts at us too."

16:53:31 You say, "I was hoping they'd fire bolts at us and not at the navy or Ather's ship."

16:53:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

Subject: SEAS Thanks You
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident

Thank you for allowing SEAS to contribute to Temporary Space Stations again. We're always here to lend a hand and to help promote the income of other pilots so that they can grow their quallifications and skills as well as they're not heavily taxed when transferring or interacting with Alliance facilities.
I've built every area currently available and then some before so and I certainly understand the the level of extra work involved. Although I appreciate the opportunity to take a break from building, I feel a little guilty that we're not building at the moment as we want to help. So if anyone needs for us to lend a hand when you need to be away, please let anyone from SEAS know. That is Shule Elemmire, Constantine Stone, Tara Flores or myself.

17:00:15 You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Nice post on General."

17:02:48 "Thanks." Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you. "Hopefully some will get the real message rather than some idiots taking things out of context. Honestly, the income we receive is pretty minor for me as compared to what I want to do for others. So when jerks like Erik spout off and say what they say, they are obviously, as I say not the brightest star in the universe and pretty ignorant."

17:04:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Erik is controlling 288 so that's why we're not going on there but he will likely get bored with it in time. Not being included on 288 won't break our hearts nor our banks as it's not consistent enough."

17:04:54 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yeah, it seemed 288 was pretty unreliable for income."

17:04:57 [Old Frontier Processor; Asteroid Mining]

17:04:58 This room appears to be a control center from which one can control drone operations at remote mining sites. There appear to be several dents in the wall.
You see a large leather couch, a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt, and a small natural golden brown trash bin here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a large leather couch. Ather Jammoa is standing here.
You can go north.
(You are sitting on a large leather couch.)

17:05:14 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "I'm actually going to go there today!"

17:05:15 Ather Jammoa beams with unparalleled satisfaction.

17:05:20 You grin at Ather Jammoa.

17:05:33 Ather Jammoa says, "I had other plans, but I couldn't put them into play fast enough, so a day of asteroid hauling it is."

17:05:44 Ather Jammoa says, "I'm hoping for 30 or 40."

17:05:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ah well good I don't have the patience for the trek out there. I sure do miss GMG though but ah well."

17:06:06 Ather Jammoa says, "You can, like I was saying yesterday, jus trift to the cross."

17:06:27 Ather Jammoa says, "The skims only make the travel time faster, but it's still quite possible to get to the cross from gateway."

17:06:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I just don't know the heading or general direction."

17:06:48 Ather Jammoa says, "You'll be subject to the riftfow, but it's doable."

17:07:27 You say to Ather, "I used to know the heading, but I don't remember it now."

17:07:33 You say, "To get to the Cross."

17:07:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I knew that much I just don't know which way to ttasks."

17:08:16 Ather Jammoa says, "It's not my secret to tell. It's far too risky to voice it pretty much anywhere. I would honestly ask the members of the Mutuality if it would be OK for you guys to know the heading, since if it reached the wrong ears, bad things could happen."

17:08:31 You nod to Ather Jammoa. "Fair point."

17:09:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I totally agree so please don't say it here."

17:09:19 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Wasn't planning on it!"

17:09:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I didn't expect you to nyway."

17:09:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll probably go exploring soonish and we can eventually figure it out I'm sure."

17:10:24 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

17:10:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When we go to GMG, we make an overnighter out of it and sometimes a week os dnewe'd be fine to make the extra effort."

17:11:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So yeah we'd take a carrier and put down a decent charging station as we've done before. The maintainer is a joke."

17:12:43 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Johann, what's your industry point count?"

17:13:21 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "And you were the one who said you made like, almost a half a billion on a rocky site, yes?"

17:13:43 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I don't recall the thigns tha tpeople tell me and who they're said by. You all tend to blend together."

17:13:51 You chuckle.

17:13:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

17:14:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident tunes a neon purple metachannel FTL communicator.

17:14:09 Ather Jammoa says into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator, "I know, Emily. However, the industry points also do have something to do with it. Things are making more and more sense!"

17:14:15 You turn general communication on.

17:14:24 Lily says to Ather, "What did he say his industry is? I didn't have general unmuted."

17:14:29 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I have a few more than that, though I'm a bit out of practice at mining."

17:14:56 Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:14:56 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Cause I have over 3000 less industry points than he does, and I'm making about 360 million. I was wondering why the figures were so drastically different."

17:15:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh because they get a lot more from that cluster over there."

17:15:32 Ather Jammoa says, "Not -that- much."

17:15:45 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I have 21864, but I didn't realize my coordinator wasn't where I thought it should have been, so ended up restarting my site and got one with fewer metals."

17:15:47 Ather Jammoa asks, "It's the industry count too. Are you telling me you haven't reached a 400 million credit income?"

17:15:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I earn a little over 400 mil form here and yesterday with the Comet, I earned 456 mil."

17:16:04 Ather Jammoa asks, "Yeah, see?"

17:16:08 Ather Jammoa says, "That's more in line with the figures."

17:16:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah but I'm just 150 shy of 20k industry."

17:16:40 Ather Jammoa speaks into his metallic blue metachannel FTL communicator:

17:16:40 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah Emily, you'll probably hit the 500 million credit mark if you do a proper site."

17:16:50 Ather Jammoa waves frantically and waves frantically!

17:16:51 Ather Jammoa strides north.

17:17:00 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

17:17:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I've been yapping too much at Crias to get a site done."

22:40:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Thing is. We've slowly been movin' this way since I've been a pilot. Which fuckin' sucks, but hindsight and all that."

22:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Cool fighter? For the destruction of an entire alliance? I fail to see the benifits..."

22:41:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, me either Johnothon."

22:42:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What did they do? Modify the Heavy Fighter with jump capability?"

22:42:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:42:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep i'll likely not accept mine if I get one or if I have to go buy it, I probably won't."

22:42:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "That's fuckin' shitty."

22:42:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's got six turrets, laser bonus, extra sotrage for torps, and FTL capable."

22:42:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I would give up that new fighter, and pay for 100 of them just to stay in the accord, I'd probably pay more too."

22:42:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:42:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Absolutely Kim."

22:42:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm drooooling."

22:43:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If it was about money, they'd probably take that deal."

22:43:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's about regulations though."

22:43:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "HOw'd it get this bad though. I mean I've been gone for a while but there must've been a way to stop this."

22:43:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I see no reason for not taking having the fighters. BUT that still doesn't give a /good/ reason to leave the accord."

22:44:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We tried for months to stop it, they've very determined though."

22:44:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It happened when Best got elected. He always said this was what he was goign to do if he got elected."

22:44:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Or... do the Accord 'rules' prevent us from having such awesome fighters?"

22:44:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "There's still time I guess, but it'd take a fuckin' miracle from what I see."

22:44:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, and we do not have much of any bargaining power left."

22:44:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's not really any time, the negotiations were actually supposed to be finished by now."

22:45:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They may already have been, and we just haven't heard."

22:45:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Well, yeh, but it's not a negotiation if we've already left the table."

22:45:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll bet we'll here about this starting the new term.."

22:45:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray sighs.

22:46:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll be taking bets... starting now..."

22:46:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well,  we were bound contractually to the Accord, so they can't just leave without breaching the agreement, hence the negotiations."

22:46:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That makes sense."

22:46:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hmm..."

22:46:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "When would the Contract close?"

22:47:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Or.. end."

22:47:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "What does this mean with our position with the EAOS? I have a feelin' it's gonna effect that too."

22:47:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Run out.. what ever you call it."

22:47:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. I think it's been about a week since they said the negotiations would be finished within the week."

22:47:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They've already stopped people from going to the EAOS, actually."

22:47:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Well we're royally fucked."

22:47:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What?"

22:47:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where do you mean?"

22:47:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Fienstein denounced his AEU citizenship over it."

22:48:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. renounced."

22:48:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Can't blame him."

22:48:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "So we're pretty much in charge of our own development, our own security, our own economy no help anywhere, and we're not well off to begin with."

22:48:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, that is about the short version of it."

22:48:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, that's the way the people want it, apparently."

22:48:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "B-b-but... what about all those amazing EAOS upgrades?"

22:49:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs sighs.

22:49:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No idea about that, we may still be able to get upgrades, but none of our citiznes are being allowed to accept induction, that's all I meant."

22:49:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Can we actually renounce our own citizenship and seek sanctuary in other places?"

22:49:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Seems like to me that's an option but a terrible one."

22:49:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs sighs.

22:49:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I would not discuss that on this channel."

22:50:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm not sayin' anyone's gonna do it, but it's a question to be asked."

22:50:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I agree.. that is not a conversation for public channels like this..."

22:50:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They're gonna kick out all the non-nationals too."

22:50:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I mean we literally have folks jumpin' ship."

22:50:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What?"

22:50:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Are you serious?"

22:50:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What... in the world.. are they trying to do?"

22:51:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, I read in the news about the peace keeping thing, what actually is that all about?"

22:51:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep. Anyone who wasn't born here I guess."

22:51:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Become an issolated world?"

22:51:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That counts me out. GOOOOOOOD bye... AEU."

22:51:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I mean.... NEEEEW EARTH>."

22:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, they are getting humanity destroyed, starting with us. That is what they are doing. They just don't see it that way, nor do they believe it."

22:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "We're turnin' into...god we're turnin' into a militant society then. Like how are we gonna be any different than Fringe. I mean we're turnin' into that without the accord. We're so fucked."

22:52:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Uh... is Best an Outsider? Impersinating a human?"

22:52:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sheesh..."

22:52:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's already kind of like that. At the protest, some folks came up adn threw rocks at us when Aisling showed up and the security guys just found somewhere to lean and watch. Said we already looked beat up when they got there."

22:54:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, I do not believe our president is an outsider impersonating a human. But I do believe he underestimates the outsider threat, a lot."

22:54:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Clearly..."

22:54:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, for a while, I kept having bad dreasms that he was an infiltrator robot."

22:55:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. bad dreams."

22:55:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's more than just that...it's literally him just sayin' we don't care about global politics we'll do it our own way..."

22:55:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "And who cares how bad of a position we're in."

22:55:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "He's being overly stubburn and arrogant."

22:55:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "We're gonna collapse there's no plans to do anythin' about it. Like what is the plan to keep us afloat."

22:56:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:56:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Kim the peacekeeping is a Ground Combat thing. You can inquire at the security office."

22:56:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan says, voice tight, "I need a fuckin' drink."

22:56:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Lock and Load. Build a station of our own, out of New Earth Space.. call it the... uh... umm... I have a few names. But none that seem quite fitting."

22:57:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, has any of you undertaken that responsibility?"

22:57:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Grays.. I can buy you a drink. I need one myself."

22:58:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:58:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "A few have. I haven't. Initially we didn't do anything but it is essentially being sent to places like Hyperion to scan around the streets for militants and so on."

22:58:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm not fuckin' doin' that. I'm not. Fuckin' motherfuck. This is bat shit."

22:58:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:58:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We protested it because it's not our job to police."

22:58:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, I will not be doing those. I'm not gonna go clomp through the streets in a battlesuit scaring people, just for the sake of trying to stop a few bad ones. The police should be able to handle it."

22:58:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. it's 5 to ten minutes there. Patrol around. Scan everything. Get out."

22:59:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I would,  if I felt like it was called for."

22:59:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Fuck that shit and light it on goddamn fire! Fuck that."

22:59:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Pfft... some people just ignore you. Like they don't care you're even there."

22:59:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Besides... why not look cool and awesome in a battlesuit to the people?"

22:59:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

22:59:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes same here but we were absolutely not trained in Law Enforcement. Defense of humanity, yes but we're not police."

22:59:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "This makes me sick."

23:00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, maybe you are right. I just know it would freak me out to see a war machine clomping around the town."

23:00:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "It doesn't send the best message to the civilians, I should think."

23:00:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We are not police indeed. And a battlesuit may look pretty, but it's not really a toy."

23:00:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "From what I heard from our Voice though, things are apparently worse over there than we've been told in the news."

23:00:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If it is made a common day thing... people won't think anything of it."

23:01:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Exactly."

23:01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's just the government tryin' to have us inforce their agenda and I'mnot havin' it."

23:01:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Johnathon I'm goin' to the lounge."

23:01:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Gee, we blow up rats, bari and outsider enforcer drones with weapons on those suits, and now we get sent in them to spot some of our fellow human beings, and do what exactly?"

23:02:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:02:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah and a battle suit isn't designed to go into crowd or other type of human law enforcement. It's here for dealing with non-human beings and entities."

23:03:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or for people in similar battlesuits, I suppose."

23:03:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:03:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah well I doubt we'd encounter many others in battlesuits."

23:03:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "There is no current orders to cause harm to any citizen. At of which, I personally would frown upon.... unless we have stun guns made available to us. But... that better come with some police training and turn us from civilian pilots to police."

23:04:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not going for that. Then I will retrain for something else."

23:04:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "There doesn't need to be I go down the street in a paladan with an explodin' harpoon and no one is gonna do anythin' to that without startin' destruction everywhere."

23:04:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll be on new earth in a minute."

23:04:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:04:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Me likewise. I didn't go to the university to study Law Enforcement."

23:04:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:04:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nor to the pilot academy."

23:04:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "From what Iunderstand, there are no targets, just patrolling. But still, the people there may not know that."

23:04:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.."

23:05:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "They don't have a clue as to why we're there."

23:05:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:05:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah still, I am concerned about their adding other responsibilities."

23:05:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But.. that's a guess."

23:05:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Likewise, Lily."

23:05:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I feel like we're missin' the point here, just by patrollin' the streets in some martial law deal we're doin' that. It's fucked and it's sends the message that if ya fuckin' rebel we'll use our own technology on ya."

23:06:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nope."

23:06:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um, hey you don't have to tell me, I have been fighting this stuff for months."

23:06:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:06:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly and it insults me as GSL to even be able to acknowledge thisias a type of work for us."

23:06:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "WE're not the navy... so it can't be martial Law."

23:06:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's a damned fine line..."

23:07:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Only reason I'm not now, is because I made a horrible mistake and was almost charged with terrorism. I had to agree not to make anymore calls to action and whatnot."

23:07:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray grunts.

23:07:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:07:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I supose we're all supposed to be bound but I just will not sell out."

23:08:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I like to think of it as keeping tabs on what is going on.. or is asked."

23:08:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm not gonna just be silenced. I can't be I just...I just can't fuckin' be."

23:09:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's a news break about it Jonathan, as well as a butt-ton of headlines."

23:10:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Like I said, it's a very damned fine line that they are playing. Don't want to give the impression that it's martial law.. but.. at the same time. It's a means of keeping a 'peacefull' presense.."

23:10:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's them doin' it without them callin' it martial law."

23:10:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right."

23:10:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "There's not a line, it's just callin' it somethin' else."

23:10:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If it was "martial law" the navy would be doing it. Not us."

23:11:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Exactly, that's the only difference."

23:11:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The navy are the ones who hand out the missions."

23:11:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:11:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh yeah I'd call it martial law because you don't go parading around in something as formidable as a battlesuit to scare innocent citizens."

23:11:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But.. no.. they send us, so they can avoid the... bad press."

23:11:17 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 210,000.31 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.

23:11:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Exactly. We're hated already, so it's no loss to public image."

23:11:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right."

23:11:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's no such thing as bad press anymore, when it comes to Union news outlets."

23:11:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "TOOOO true."

23:12:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Union News outlets should be added to the game of horrible people..."

23:12:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs laughs.

23:12:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um... ok, Iknow this is a serious conversation, but that was funny right there."

23:12:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I just can't laugh about that."

23:13:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Neither can I, but I can see the humor."

23:13:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:13:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I can sort of but all of this is just dark dark and despairing."

23:13:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's not funny at all."

23:14:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes it is, Lily. It is very despairing."

23:14:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:14:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wish we had another member to support in SEAS for another cruiser as we'll probably need a lot of what we can muster when Outsiders come back."

23:15:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

23:15:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thankfully we have two and room for a third which will probably go to Constantine if he can get back from his detail to finish his qualification."

23:29:35 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Nest?"

23:29:47 [Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."

23:29:49 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"

23:30:41 [Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone else?"

23:39:40 Johnathon Triggs walks in from the north.

23:39:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Johnathon Triggs.

23:39:48 Johnathon Triggs waves.

23:40:05 Johnathon Triggs says, "Hmm... site almost complete."

23:42:15 Johnathon Triggs nods.

23:42:18 Johnathon Triggs says, "Nice."

23:42:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.

23:42:41 Johnathon Triggs says, "First site... just over 5.9 mil.. and 5 points."

23:43:17 Lily says to Johnathon, "Ok just so you know, if you leave before conquest end, until we cleanse this area, you won't be able to get back in so you might want to try to stay until it is completed."

23:43:37 Johnathon Triggs says, "It's done."

23:43:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers for Johnathon Triggs!

23:44:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well mine is taking awhile because I had so much ore! So I will hang-in with it."

23:44:29 Johnathon says to Lily, "Ah.. that's why I couldn't approach here, before now.."

23:44:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."

23:44:43 Johnathon Triggs says, "Well.. till we took out some of the bari."

23:44:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is why we have to cleanse it to get it reopened."

23:44:57 Johnathon Triggs nods.

23:45:40 Johnathon Triggs says, "I switched to lasers. So, as soon as the next conquest starts. Count me in on cleansing the place of bari."

23:45:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You can start another before conquest but again you need to stay with it even after conquest ends if you want to complete it."

23:45:50 Johnathon Triggs says, "I need more ground time, anyways."

23:45:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

23:46:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I've started a few just before conquest end and gotten that dividend."

23:46:14 Johnathon Triggs glances down at his watch momentarily.

23:46:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.

23:47:26 Johnathon Triggs says, "Could almost have a deployment station set up here.. just to help keeping it clear."

23:47:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

23:47:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well that would be nice!"

23:48:09 Johnathon says to Lily, "Might recommending it?"

23:48:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I can't tell you what an effort it was to finally get them to allow us to open it up. We came here repeatedly and cleansed but they wouldn't open it."

23:48:31 Johnathon Triggs nods.

23:48:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "When they did, we were all ecstatic!"

23:48:52 Johnathon Triggs exclaims, "That's good!"

23:49:37 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Imagine what benefits could be produced with a deployment station set up here?"

23:50:16 Johnathon Triggs says, "Would be one more step closer to have this place cleared."

23:50:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well it's hard to get them to budge on our behalf or what they perceive to be on our behalf even though this brings a lot of industrial material into the government."

23:50:50 Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

23:52:31 Johnathon Triggs says, "Think I need to improve my industry a bit, before I start another site."

23:52:42 Johnathon Triggs says, "Just to get more out of it."

23:52:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Naa just keep at it as you'll always earn something."

23:53:11 Johnathon Triggs says, "That last site took me about 2 and half hours.."

23:53:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When I was a new pilot, I made it my goal to always complete the two allowed mining sites per day."

23:53:28 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

23:53:29 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.

23:53:40 Johnathon Triggs nods.

23:53:43 Johnathon Triggs switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

23:54:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because you get some nice cash out of these for things you need."

23:54:19 Johnathon Triggs nods.

23:54:46 Johnathon says to Lily, "It's actually very enjoyable..."

23:55:25 Johnathon Triggs says, "Though... in 3 hours... I'll be honest.. I could make more right now doing tesla runs."

23:55:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "The mining points you earn also help towards better sites and yes you'll need to earn theindustry to obtain upgrades and eventually the first license which I think is at 500 points?"

23:55:47 Johnathon Triggs nods.

23:55:52 Johnathon Triggs says, "It is, 500."

23:55:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

23:56:56 Johnathon says to Lily, "Right now, too, I need to focus earning the points.. rather than the Creds... so I might be able to find a part i've been looking for.. with no luck."

23:57:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Which part?"

23:57:32 Johnathon says to Lily, "Oh.. just some random old part.."

23:57:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

23:58:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Do you have a name for it? I can't really tell you specifically. However if yo know what it is, I probably can tell you where it's likely to be found."

23:59:25 Johnathon Triggs says, "It's an old jinu part. I've looked high an low.. in all directions. But.. it eludes me."

23:59:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

23:59:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Which project is this for?"
