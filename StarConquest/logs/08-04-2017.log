01:00:44 You peer north...

01:00:44 
[Starship "Second Chances"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a square white rattan coffee table with a glass top here.
Lexie Amarras, Nathaniel Owens, and Egil Aurstad are standing here.
You can go south and out.

01:00:50 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "And every time you question my questions, I will question your questions with more confusing questions till you're questioning your own questions."

01:01:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:01:03 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Heres a question for you. Can you shut the fuck up?"

01:01:06 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

01:01:28 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:01:31 You hear a loud bang above you somewhere as ship systems are repaired outside.

01:01:34 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Here's a response. Speak to me like that again, and we'll have issues."

01:01:42 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:01:52 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:01:56 Small clinks of metal come from the hull of the ship as it's being repaired.

01:02:00 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Hmm I think one or maybe four or five of us are confused."

01:02:10 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Count me in on that."

01:02:27 I don't understand that.

01:02:30 [Starship "Second Chances"; Weapons Room Two]

01:03:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:03:10 Lexie Amarras asks, "You again?"

01:03:12 Nathaniel Owens flicks a small switch.

01:03:12 A small light next to the word MANUAL switches on, while a similar light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches off.
Lexie Amarras grins.

01:03:18 Nathaniel Owens says, "Thought you were six feet under."

01:03:19 Nathaniel Owens deftly enters a command on the navigation board.

01:03:21 You grin.

01:03:22 Nathaniel Owens presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:03:29 You say, "Always me."

01:03:31 Nathaniel Owens presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:03:45 Egil Aurstad says to Nathaniel, "I don't think you said that on the comms, Nathaniel."

01:03:48 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:04:01 Nathaniel says to Egil Aurstad, "Said what?"

01:04:03 Nathaniel Owens deftly enters a command on the navigation board.

01:04:08 You say, "Always innocent and always always an angel and normal."

01:04:18 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:04:21 Egil Aurstad says, "Oh, wait, I think you did after all."

01:04:24 Lexie looks at Shule with wide eyes then bursts out laughing.

01:04:26 Egil Aurstad asks, "What channel did you say it on?"

01:04:27 Nathaniel Owens speaks into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

01:04:27 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Shuele is supposidly inicent. Any objections?"

01:04:35 Nathaniel Owens presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:04:38 Lexie Amarras speaks into her metachannel FTL communicator and watch:

01:04:38 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Many."

01:04:41 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits an irritating burst of static.

01:04:41 I don't understand that.

01:04:42 Nathaniel Owens deftly enters a command on the navigation board.

01:04:55 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:04:55 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "No, because everyone knows it's true."

01:04:56 Nathaniel Owens presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:05:04 Lexie Amarras pats Egil Aurstad on the back.

01:05:05 Nathaniel Owens asks, "Another nest?"

01:05:12 Lexie Amarras asks, "So how's it feel to not be a rats virgin now?"

01:05:14 Lexie Amarras grins.

01:05:16 Nathaniel Owens deftly enters a command on the navigation board.

01:05:17 Lexie Amarras says, "I can't."

01:05:19 You grin.

01:05:23 Nathaniel Owens presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:05:24 Lexie Amarras says, OOCly, "Had a house guest here the last five minutes."

01:05:25 Nathaniel Owens presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:05:26 Egil Aurstad says, "Overwhelmed."

01:05:30 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:05:43 Nathaniel Owens presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:05:44 The starship transitions into another sector.

01:05:46 Nathaniel Owens flicks a small switch.

01:05:46 A small light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches on, while a similar light next to the word MANUAL switches off.

01:05:47 Nathaniel Owens presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:05:48 Nathaniel Owens deftly enters a set of coordinates, and the computer chirps in confirmation.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: (11, 1, 1).

01:05:49 Nathaniel Owens presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

01:05:50 You shake your head at Nathaniel Owens. "I can't."

01:05:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:05:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:05:52 Nathaniel Owens presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:05:52 Nathaniel Owens deftly enters a set of coordinates, and the computer chirps in confirmation.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: (1, 1, 1).

01:05:56 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:06:00 Lexie Amarras says, "And if you want practice with repair and what-not maybe I could take you on some of my more advanced rats pod things from space vermin."

01:06:19 Egil Aurstad says, "Ahh, that'd be great."

01:06:37 Lexie Amarras says, "Ok i'll try and catch up with you and we can do that."

01:06:46 Nathaniel Owens glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

01:06:49 Lexie Amarras presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:06:49 You say to Egil, "Just don't do what one fringe pilot did and solo a rats nest by him or herself."

01:06:59 Nathaniel Owens exclaims, "I should try that!"

01:07:01 Egil Aurstad asks, "Who did that?"

01:07:13 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:07:14 You say, "No idea. But they blew up no less than 8 times."

01:07:29 Lexie Amarras says, "That sounds so.... Intriguing."

01:07:33 You chuckle.

01:07:36 Lexie Amarras presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:07:39 Nathaniel Owens says, "Feel like trying this."

01:07:40 Nathaniel Owens flicks a small switch.

01:07:40 A small light next to the word MANUAL switches on, while a similar light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches off.

01:08:11 Nathaniel Owens flicks a small switch.

01:08:11 A small light next to the word AUTOPILOT switches on, while a similar light next to the word MANUAL switches off.

01:08:12 Nathaniel Owens presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:08:19 Nathaniel Owens presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:08:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:08:20 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

01:08:23 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:08:23 Nathaniel Owens stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

01:08:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:08:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:08:27 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:08:27 Lexie Amarras cheers.

01:08:27 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

01:08:28 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:08:30 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:08:31 You grin.

01:08:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:08:31 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:08:34 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Hello, Second Chances! Welcome to League space! Make yourself at home!"

01:08:37 Lexie Amarras says, "Thanks for leading nate. It was fun."

01:08:38 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 978" has jumped out of the sector.

01:08:39 Nathaniel Owens says, "Those that need there suits back on chet, please wai."

01:08:40 Nathaniel Owens says, "Wait]."

01:08:42 You say, "Thanks all."

01:08:47 Nathaniel Owens presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

01:08:47 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

01:08:50 Egil Aurstad says, "Thanks for having me."

01:08:50 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:08:54 Lexie Amarras says, "I can take someone back to chetumal."

01:08:58 Lexie Amarras says, "I'm headed that way."

01:09:11 Nathaniel Owens asks, "You can't transport a suit though, right?"

01:09:15 Lexie Amarras says, "Two in the gemini."

01:09:21 Lexie Amarras says, "Mine and one other."

01:09:22 Nathaniel Owens nods.

01:09:26 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:09:26 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:09:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Welcome, Second Chances. Your allies the League welcome you to this spaceport."

01:09:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:09:31 Lexie Amarras asks, "Egil need your suit back at chet?"

01:09:35 You wave.

01:09:37 Lexie Amarras waves to you.

01:09:38 Nathaniel Owens waves.

01:09:40 You say, "See you all later."

01:09:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:09:42 You hug Lexie Amarras.

01:09:44 [Starship "Second Chances"; Airlock]

01:09:44 You see a portable silver toilet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:09:45 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:09:45 You exit the ship.

01:09:45 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-95", the two-person light corvette "League Navy Assault Corvette Kestrel-49", and the four-person mule "Second Chances" are landed here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a personal hoverpallet, and Chuck the humanoid service robot here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, and down.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to the spaceport.

01:09:46 Spaceport security officers empty the four-person mule "Second Chances".

01:09:47 [Manhattan Spaceport; Garage]

01:09:47 You can go up.

01:09:52 I don't understand that.

01:09:54 [Starship "Fearless"; Airlock]

01:09:55 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
Your battlesuit is automatically transferred to battlesuit storage aboard this ship.

01:09:56 I don't understand that.

01:09:57 I don't understand that.

01:09:58 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

01:09:58 You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of projectile boost here.
You can go up and out.

01:09:59 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:09:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:10:00 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:10:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

01:10:05 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:10:07 Recent FTL Drive Traces:

01:10:08 
EAOS transport "Registered Merchant 978" departed to EAOS sector Torus Corridor (Alpha-1) approximately 9 minutes ago.
League transport "Registered Merchant 098" departed to League sector Lagrange 5 (Alpha-1) approximately 2 minutes ago.
EAOS transport "Registered Merchant 978" departed to EAOS sector Torus Corridor (Alpha-1) approximately 1 minute ago.

01:10:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:12:17 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:12:20 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:12:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:12:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:12:23 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

01:12:29 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:12:31 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Fearless! Welcome to home space!"

01:12:59 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:13:01 The starship is already moving.

01:13:01 The starship is already moving.

01:13:09 Lileah Rose suddenly awakens.

01:13:13 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 989" has launched from New Earth.

01:13:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:13:24 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:13:29 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Fearless. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:13:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:13:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:13:45 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:13:53 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:13:53 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:27:13 Some lights on the two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker" suddenly flash several times.

01:27:14 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Airlock]
You can go out and into the ship.
Lileah Rose followed you.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:27:17 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Control Room]

01:27:17 You see a large beanbag chair, a sector debris scanner, an AutoVector navigation unit, a starship simulator, and an asteroid hauling supply kit here.

01:27:38 You sit down on a large beanbag chair.

01:27:40 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

01:27:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:27:42 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:27:43 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

01:27:48 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I was about to ask who stole my shipwrecks, but I found them."

01:27:48 You say, "ok"

01:27:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Little Rocker, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:27:50 Lileah Rose says, "i'll let you fly us"

01:27:53 Lileah Rose grins.

01:27:58 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:28:01 You say, "that could be dangerous"

01:28:05 You chuckle.

01:28:16 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Would anyone be interested in a salvage op?"

01:29:12 You don't yet have the experience to know how to use that.

01:29:17 You frown.

01:29:21 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Given the work needed for a salvage op, Its probably best to plan that ahead so people have time to be ready."

01:29:26 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Do we even have enough awake peopel to do a salvage op?"

01:29:31 You say to Lileah Rose, "I can't use the  autovector thingy."

01:30:05 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We can do a small one with 5."

01:30:07 Your metallic gold touch einrophone trills quietly, indicating a new story has been posted under "Mutuality."

01:30:29 You ponder for a moment and reflect.

01:30:34 [General Communication] Peopel Nathaniel Owens transmits, "But do all those five people have the equipment ot salvage grade 50 stuff?"

01:32:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok."

01:33:01 You say, "hmmm,"

01:33:18 You say, "'this might take a while if I can't use the autovector thing."

02:04:17 You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

02:04:20 You lower an asteroid anchor to the ground and press a button on its side.  The anchor seeks the best angle downwards.

02:04:20 (18 seconds roundtime.)

02:04:37 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

02:04:39 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

02:04:39 (58 seconds roundtime.)

02:05:37 You step back and tug on the free end of the line, note that it seems secure, and decide to move on to the next step.

02:11:53 You sit down on a large beanbag chair.

02:11:57 You notice Lileah Rose using the radio to ask for launch clearance.

02:12:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Little Rocker, you have clearance to undock.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

02:12:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:12:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:12:14 Lileah Rose glances at the computer's current coordinates display.

02:12:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:12:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What? I'm supposed to know things? I knew there was a catch to this whole Invaders thing."

02:14:06 The computer reports the presence of an asteroid.

02:14:08 Lileah Rose presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

02:14:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:14:12 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

02:14:14 Lileah Rose presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:14:15 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Asteroid (nearest).

02:14:17 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:14:18 Lileah Rose puts a plain white spacesuit helmet on her head.

02:14:25 Lileah Rose stands up.

02:14:25 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "While I'm doing this, Nicolette, was the QSA treaty something you had to do as the Voice?"

02:14:29 Lileah Rose removes an asteroid anchor from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

02:14:29 You turn to page Fourteen.

02:14:37 You put a plain white spacesuit helmet on your head.

02:14:45 You kiss Lileah Rose.

02:14:48 You remove an asteroid anchor from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

02:14:49 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Airlock]

02:14:50 You can go into the ship.

02:14:55 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I had nothing to do with it."

02:15:05 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:15:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.

02:15:09 Lileah Rose just arrived.

02:15:12 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:15:15 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

02:15:17 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the asteroid's surface.

02:15:17 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow.  Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

02:15:22 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Not one single solitary thing."

02:15:27 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

02:15:28 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

02:15:29 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

02:15:30 [Asteroid Surface]

02:15:30 The two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker" is parked here.
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.
Lileah Rose exits from the two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker".

02:15:31 [Asteroid Surface]

02:15:31 You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

02:15:32 You lower an asteroid anchor to the ground and press a button on its side.  The anchor seeks the best angle downwards.

02:15:33 (16 seconds roundtime.)

02:15:39 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok, so this wasn't something that the AEU pilot corps just dropped the ball on then. It still stinks, but at least it wasn't a dumb mistake."

02:15:48 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

02:15:49 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

02:15:50 (48 seconds roundtime.)

02:16:11 An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades                                         Page 14

Destroyers:
Three-Person Light Escort 15,000,000.00 (New Earth Blazing Trails)
AS-0A AEU LIGHT ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 50 industry points        15 combat points
Model number: AS-0A                     Designation: Light Escort
Turret hardpoints: 10                   Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The light Escort is the first destroyer that an AEU pilot will ever have access to. It's a reasonably well armed vessel, with no major bonuses. However, it can still pack quite a punch, especially with more advanced upgrades and its single launcher.

Three-Person Heavy Defense Vessel 7,500,000.00 (Endymion)
AD-1N AEU HEAVY DEFENSE VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 100 industry points       250 combat points
Model number: AD-1N                     Designation: Heavy Defense Vessel
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 4
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The defense vessel is a very well armed vessel, holding 12 turrets. It does have a major disadvantage though, which like
02:16:11 ly also explains the cheaper cost. That disadvantage is that it has no FTL drive. However, it can still be a very useful ship, but just know if you want to take it anywhere you'll need to dock it inside a bigger ship, or tug it around using a tugboat.

Three-Person Clipper 200,000,000.00 (New Earth Allied Technologies)
AS-4F AEU CLIPPER-CLASS ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 750 industry points       750 combat points
Model number: AS-4F                     Designation: Clipper
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 14
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The Clipper is the most advanced destroyer that the AEU has. It's as armed as the defense vessel with 12 turrets, but has the further advantage of a vastly increased engine speed when it's going at maximum burn, and also has an extra hull failsafe over the other two destroyers.

02:16:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Correction, not the pilot's dumb mistake anyways."

02:16:37 You step back and tug on the free end of the line, note that it seems secure, and decide to move on to the next step.

02:16:42 [Asteroid Surface]

02:16:42 The two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker" is parked here.
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

02:16:43 [Asteroid Surface]

02:16:43 You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

02:16:45 You remove an asteroid anchor from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

02:16:47 You lower an asteroid anchor to the ground and press a button on its side.  The anchor seeks the best angle downwards.

02:16:47 (11 seconds roundtime.)

02:16:58 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

02:17:03 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

02:17:03 (44 seconds roundtime.)

02:17:08 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Yes, all balls needed were dropped already during election thing. No balls are left."

02:17:25 [General Communication] Tara Flores snorts.

02:17:47 You step back and look over your shoulder, and see that the line, now secured to two anchors, stretches nicely over your ship.  Hopefully it will hold.

02:17:50 [Asteroid Surface]

02:17:50 The two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker" is parked here.
You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

02:17:51 Board what?

02:17:53 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That must be quite a painful problem."

02:17:54 Some lights on the two-person asteroid hauler "Little Rocker" suddenly flash several times.

02:17:54 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Airlock]
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go out and into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:17:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Have the skims already been cut off to us Pierre?"

02:17:57 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:18:00 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Beginning cycling."

02:18:00 You smile at Lileah Rose.

02:18:01 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from red to yellow.  Through your suit, you gradually begin to hear the hiss of air entering the airlock.

02:18:05 Lileah Rose smiles at you.

02:18:12 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes green.

02:18:12 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aisling?"

02:18:13 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

02:18:14 The computer announces, "Cycling complete."

02:18:14 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Only one way to find out."

02:18:14 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Control Room]

02:18:15 You see a large beanbag chair, a sector debris scanner, an AutoVector navigation unit, and a starship simulator here.
You can go up and out.

02:18:15 Lileah Rose just entered the ship.

02:18:16 You press the button to deploy the ship's anchor.

02:18:16 A sharp crack is heard throughout the ship as the anchors on either side deploy with explosive force, biting deep into the surface of the asteroid.

02:18:19 Which space station do you intend to haul this asteroid to?

02:18:19

02:18:20 The ship's engines fire, and the anchored asteroid gradually begins to move toward Space Station Delta.

02:18:20 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately three sectors from its destination.

02:18:22 You sit down on a large beanbag chair.

02:18:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, I'll go check shortly."

02:18:26 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately two sectors from its destination.

02:18:31 Lileah Rose sits down on a large beanbag chair.

02:18:34 Lileah Rose removes a plain white spacesuit helmet from her head.

02:18:41 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "RATS nest three sectors east of orion."

02:18:58 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Six fighters guarding it."

02:19:01 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, now what am I looking for Evenia?"

02:19:02 You remove a plain white spacesuit helmet from your head.

02:19:04 You kiss Lileah Rose.

02:19:05 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would really be disappointing."

02:19:08 Lileah Rose kisses you.

02:19:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That's normal Tara."

02:19:17 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Life is very often disappointing."

02:19:20 Lileah Rose kisses you long and passionately

Model number: AS-0A                     Designation: Light Escort
Turret hardpoints: 10                   Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The light Escort is the first destroyer that an AEU pilot will ever have access to. It's a reasonably well armed vessel, with no major bonuses. However, it can still pack quite a punch, especially with more advanced upgrades and its single launcher.

Three-Person Heavy Defense Vessel 7,500,000.00 (Endymion)
AD-1N AEU HEAVY DEFENSE VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 100 industry points       250 combat points
Model number: AD-1N                     Designation: Heavy Defense Vessel
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 4
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The defense vessel is a very well armed vessel, holding 12 turrets. It does have a major disadvantage though, which like
02:19:31 ly also explains the cheaper cost. That disadvantage is that it has no FTL drive. However, it can still be a very useful ship, but just know if you want to take it anywhere you'll need to dock it inside a bigger ship, or tug it around using a tugboat.

Three-Person Clipper 200,000,000.00 (New Earth Allied Technologies)
AS-4F AEU CLIPPER-CLASS ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 750 industry points       750 combat points
Model number: AS-4F                     Designation: Clipper
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 14
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The Clipper is the most advanced destroyer that the AEU has. It's as armed as the defense vessel with 12 turrets, but has the further advantage of a vastly increased engine speed when it's going at maximum burn, and also has an extra hull failsafe over the other two destroyers.

02:19:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

02:19:35 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That sounded really maudlin."

02:19:38 The computer reports that the asteroid is approximately one sector from its destination.

02:19:38 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm fine, guys."

02:19:58 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Um...I just need to know, what part invaders is contributing to the xeno station in orion. If I'm going to put another up...that would help. 99% of the time you guys contribute ejectors, but yeah."

02:20:27 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, here's to hoping we don't have to retreat into Mutuality space for any reason. Like from supposed non-threat aliens."

02:20:40 [General Communication] Nathaniel Owens transmits, "Huh?"

02:21:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Exactly Nathaniel, exactl."

02:21:08 [Starship "Kalliste"; Engineering Room]

02:21:08 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go north.

02:21:10 [Starship "Kalliste"; Storage Room]

02:21:10 You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers" here.
You can go north and south.

02:21:11 [Starship "Kalliste"; Control Room]

02:21:11 You see a gray leather captain's chair and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south and out.

02:21:12 [Starship "Kalliste"; Airlock]

02:21:12 You can go out and enter into the ship.

02:21:12 You exit the ship.

02:21:17 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:21:17 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:21:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:21:18 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:21:19 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:21:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:21:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:21:40 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:21:41 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:21:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

02:21:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:21:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:21:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:21:51 As the asteroid falls into the station's collection bay, your ship detaches and heads for the docking bay.

02:21:51 You receive 5050000.00 AEU credits for this asteroid!

02:21:52 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Firestorm, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

02:21:55 Lileah Rose stands up.

02:21:56 You stand up.

02:22:19 [New Earth; Space Station Delta; Dock]

02:22:19 This enormous room provides enough space for dozens of ships, and docks for each. Ships periodically enter the dock, thrusters burning against the sudden change to artificial gravity. You stand on a raised platform which forms a semicircle around the docks themselves. Short flights of steps pave the way between. The walls are a cold metallic grey, dirty with years of exhaust, but somehow give off a feeling of comfort. Corridors can be seen to the northeast and northwest.

02:26:46 You can go into the ship.

02:26:47 You remove an asteroid anchor from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

02:26:48 You need a free hand to take that.

02:26:53  You are wearing a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt, a pair of slim Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

02:26:53 You are carrying a copy of "An AEU Pilot's Guide To Ships And Upgrades" in your right hand.

02:26:58 You don't have a gold spacesuit helmet.

02:27:03 For a top, you are wearing a plain white spacesuit top over a grey vee-neck shirt.  For a bottom, you are wearing a plain white spacesuit bottom over a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of cotton briefs under that.  You have on a pair of plain white spacesuit boots.  You are also wearing a backpack, a leather briefcase, a metafrequency FTL transmitter, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, an asteroid hauling supply kit, a standard starship flightbag, and a pair of plain white spacesuit gloves.

02:27:04 You are carrying a plain white spacesuit helmet in your right hand, and an asteroid anchor in your left hand.

02:27:11 You put a plain white spacesuit helmet on your head.

02:27:12 You remove a coil of neutronium-threaded line from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

02:27:23 The ship's current engine speed is 6000 km/s.

02:27:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:27:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward an asteroid.

02:27:27 Lileah Rose just arrived.

02:27:30 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:27:33 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

02:27:35 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow.  Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

02:27:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the asteroid's surface.

02:27:45 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

02:27:46 You may not leave the airlock while it is cycling.

02:27:47 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

02:28:05 That line needs to be attached to an anchor, which can't be found here.

02:28:07 You lower an asteroid anchor to the ground and press a button on its side.  The anchor seeks the best angle downwards.

02:28:07 (12 seconds roundtime.)

02:28:19 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

02:28:30 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

02:53:28 Lileah Rose puts a plain white spacesuit helmet on her head.

02:53:28 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "That is not comforting!"

02:53:31 Lileah Rose removes an asteroid anchor from an asteroid hauling supply kit.

02:53:32 You kiss Lileah Rose.

02:53:34 Wear what?

02:53:36 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:53:37 You put a plain white spacesuit helmet on your head.

02:53:38 [Starship "Little Rocker"; Airlock]

02:53:48 You press a large button marked CYCLE.

02:53:50 Lileah Rose kisses you.

02:53:51 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the asteroid's surface.

02:53:51 The computer announces, "Beginning cycling."

02:53:53 A small light on the airlock control panel turns from green to yellow.  Through your suit, you hear the hiss of air quickly leaving the airlock.

02:53:54 You grin.

02:53:57 Lileah Rose smiles.

02:54:03 The hiss of air slowly fades away into nothingness, and the yellow light becomes red.

02:54:05 The computer announces over your suit radio, "Cycling complete."

02:54:06 You can go north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast, and southwest.

02:54:08 You lower an asteroid anchor to the ground and press a button on its side.  The anchor seeks the best angle downwards.

02:54:09 (16 seconds roundtime.)

02:54:11 Wait 14 seconds.

02:54:24 Suddenly, an asteroid anchor leaps from your hand and buries itself in the ground.  You feel vibrations through your boots as the anchor secures itself in the surface of the asteroid.

02:54:33 You begin to painstakingly secure a coil of neutronium-threaded line to an asteroid anchor.

02:54:33 (31 seconds roundtime.)

02:55:04 You step back and tug on the free end of the line, note that it seems secure, and decide to move on to the next step.

02:55:13 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, let's see. If he doesn't feed you to his lizard or whatever. I'll eat you instead. Is that better?"

You can go northeast and northwest.

03:01:19 [New Earth; Space Station Delta; Dock]

03:01:19 This enormous room provides enough space for dozens of ships, and docks for each. Ships periodically enter the dock, thrusters burning against the sudden change to artificial gravity. You stand on a raised platform which forms a semicircle around the docks themselves. Short flights of steps pave the way between. The walls are a cold metallic grey, dirty with years of exhaust, but somehow give off a feeling of comfort. Corridors can be seen to the northeast and northwest.

03:09:35 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

03:09:35 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:09:35 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.

05:58:38 [MTTS] Butchulla: Bug squishing. It never ends. Does it?

05:58:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Already bought a capital insurance plan for it."

06:00:31 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh I love it. And so very true.

06:00:46 [MTTS] Butchulla: I do feel your pain, I promise.

06:01:21 [MTTS] usfolks: Now I want to sing it. Just don't let the bugs eat my ships...

06:01:47 [MTTS] Butchulla: Though hmmm, nibbled paint could look sorta cool.

06:02:28 [MTTS] usfolks: Scary.

06:03:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh? I'm suppose I'm officially a mental case."

06:15:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Found an artifact."

06:15:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Woo! Snatch that shit! Snatch it real good!"

06:15:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Wonder what it is."

06:16:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Maybe it'll be an old bombardment canister, those are nice."

06:18:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It looks like some sorta torpedo."

06:22:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Huh. I'm in delta ten security space now."

06:22:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's basically like saying no security space."

07:23:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How much will four artifacts net me, most likely?"

07:36:43 [MTTS] Squidmind: Only late 00s kids will remember when there was a ship called the 'retroflitter.'

07:39:10 [MTTS] Butchulla: I feel like I want one of those, even judging by it's name.

07:39:48 [MTTS] autumnrain: Agreed.

07:39:51 [MTTS] Squidmind: They still exist, their short name just changed to 'U.N. Flitter'

07:40:08 [MTTS] davetaylor: It won't have any of the modern features, you'll have to move mannually from sector to sector to get anywhere.

07:40:52 [MTTS] Butchulla: Yeah...I'm lazy, I changed my mind.

07:41:02 [MTTS] autumnrain: Hahaha.

07:41:13 [MTTS] usfolks: Neato trumps laziness for me. Heh.

07:41:34 [MTTS] Squidmind: It's just one of the basic Mutuality ships.

07:41:35 [MTTS] Butchulla: I'd probably get a ship of that name, even just to have it. That's cool.

07:41:36 [MTTS] davetaylor: Imagine Chet to Earth with only manual sector navigation.

07:42:05 [MTTS] Squidmind: It would take longer than your natural lifespan.

07:42:11 [MTTS] Butchulla: Imagining that makes me wanna curl up into a ball and cry.

07:42:13 [MTTS] davetaylor: Exactly.

07:42:13 [MTTS] autumnrain: I'd rather not imagine that, I could dream bad things imagining that.

07:46:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Are you actually in there, Con?"

07:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I found six artifacts travelign west out of the battle of mir."

07:47:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've heard that artifacts in the bubble give you three points per, but I don't have enough points to go out there."

07:47:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, cool!"

07:47:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think artifacts from 777 pay a bit better, but I'm not certain."

07:48:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Am I actually where, Dak?"

07:48:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, im heading to 777, then sleeping. Ill gather artifacts there tommorow."

07:49:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "In your head."

07:49:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.

07:49:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, barely."

07:52:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "One hour and fourty minutes."

07:52:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Now I've found that I can only find a certain number of artifacts in a day before I just stop seeing anything out there."

07:52:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You'll have to let me know what your experience is."

07:53:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like I usually get 1 artifact every 15 or so sectors until I have 22 or so, then I can go 1000 sectors and find nothing."

07:53:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why this would be the case, I have no idea."

07:53:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe stuff has to drift back in."

07:54:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I found two on the way out on my search, and four on the way back."

08:01:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Con."

08:01:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes."

08:01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Can the scout be fitted with a rift drive?"

08:01:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course!"

08:01:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's my next goal."

08:01:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anything with a FTL drive can be fitted with one."

08:01:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's great out in 777, because there's no slow flying back to the beacon."

08:01:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can just rift back."

08:02:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Flying back from 777 right now would take like 10 minutes."

08:02:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, I mean if you were artifacting and flew 1000 sectors north."

08:02:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You wouldn't have to turn around and go back."

08:02:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You could just rift back in 2-3 seconds."

08:02:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Ohhh."

08:03:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, at least this is a pretty rift. Rainbow roads, clouds, and such. Makes me squint my eyes at all the colours though."

08:04:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

08:04:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I carry some sunglasses with,  just in case I run inot that one."

08:05:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Im just hoping the flow changes soon."

08:06:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "T&ere's a rift forecaster you can get at some point that will help you know when that wil happen."

08:07:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Starting to lose signal now, it seems."

09:53:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You get that new scout, Dak?"

09:54:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I was buying a scout?"

09:54:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I thought you said you were."

09:54:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Nah. I got a hold that's three times as large."

09:55:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, I must have dreamed it."

09:56:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Well, I don't think a scout would do me much good without jets."

09:57:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "My next purchase will probably be a roid hauler anyways."

09:57:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I was thinking combat scout. I was going to see if you wanted to do a beacon in it."

09:57:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You need a,bit more for that, don't you?"

09:57:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, you could get a regular scout then have it refitted."

09:57:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow, yeah it's 500/500."

09:58:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What is the refitted one like?"

09:58:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does it get any guns in the control room?"

09:58:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's got seven turrets. It's likke a discou>t combat scout. Not quite as good, but it's decent."

09:59:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er it's bascially a combat scout without the laser bonus, if I'm remembering correctly."

09:59:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

10:00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "For some reason, I think those security fighters are pretty neat. No jump drive, but neat."

10:00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I used to love those, for real."

10:01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't really care for the grid issues that 6 turrets on a fighter gave me."

10:01:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Especially since you get to use other alliances tech o; them. But also,  I'm from Hyperion so it's like, Hyperion represent."

10:02:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We got any others around from Hyperion, or is it just you and I?"

10:08:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ugh, I dropped my communicator into my turnover."

10:12:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Because it' sgot decent grade chunks?"

10:13:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It was probably just bad luck, but I felt like everything I scanned was a roid."

10:13:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think people tolerate it because it's the best you can get without rifting places."

10:14:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just salvage every chunk."

10:14:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Flying around trying to figure out which ones are comets is too terrible until you have an expert scanner."

10:15:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've yet to salvage a roid that was worth my time, but maybe it's not so bad with a much larger hold."

10:15:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You culd always expel iron and lead, that might make you like it a bit more?"

10:15:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or try 777? It's got lots of decent shipwrecks."

10:16:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Iron and lead make my soul bleed."

10:16:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll likely be able to start working in 777 soon enough though. There's a few upgrades I want before I head out there."

10:20:45 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yo Evenia."

10:20:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "What do you want with mYes?"

10:21:01 [General Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

10:21:14 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Remember when you were talking about a place where you found 50 artifacts in one day?"

10:21:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I do."

10:21:41 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where was that place?"

10:23:38 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "From b-24. You need to go at a heading of 157.5. 7."

10:24:14 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How will I know when I get there?"

10:25:09 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It will show up on your rift locations."

10:25:36 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you know about how far it is?"

10:26:32 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm going ot take a wild guess here, and say about twenty lightyears? Evenia can correct me if I'm wrong."

10:27:08 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And what might it look like on my rift location list?"

10:28:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's a ship graveyward, it'll show up as like the remains of blah blah, or fall of the Fringe 45th or something like that."

10:28:30 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I can't remember the exact distance. But it's an artifact field. Like the 777 field. Just a different name."

10:28:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, exactly."

10:28:57 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Awesome! Thanks, guys."

10:29:31 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You're totally welcome. Just please be careful if you're going to rift. Make sure you have rift tools."

10:29:43 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that was the last they ever heard of Constantine."

10:29:57 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Don't joke like that when i; comes to the rift."

10:30:30 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I have some tools around here."

10:30:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You know what kind of tools she's talking about right? They hyperspanner and the zero-point energy charger?"

10:31:03 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I have those."

10:31:13 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't ever used them, but I do have a set."

10:31:55 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Make sure you keep track of where you are going so you can find your way back, you won't be able to auto-travel back."

10:32:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I figure I'll have to keep careful track of how many sectors I move, retrace my steps, and then make sure I use the reverse heading from that same sector, right?"

10:33:58 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is going to be 337.5, -7, right? It works like a circle like that?"

10:34:06 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Clearly I am ready for this journey."

10:34:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sure you wouldn't rather have someone go with you? I mean I did it the way you are talking, but I'm also a little crazy."

10:34:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

10:34:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But this could be an adventure."

10:35:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what I would have said. I won't say another word. Good luck and just be careful. Have you guided a ship in using the drive before?"

10:36:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, not as such. But I do have an NDB locator."

10:36:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's not what Imean."

10:36:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

10:36:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, have you done an approach? As in hitting your target with the drive?"

10:36:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, no."

10:37:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can I easily practice that in home space somewhere?"

10:37:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be a useful thing, if we knew the heading from New Earth to the Torus or something."

10:37:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To practice approaches."

10:37:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, you could just go outa lightyear and then guide it back in to practice real quick if you want. Just going to want to make sure you keep a close eye on the location @s you get closer, and reduce your trim as you get closer to make it easier to stay accur-te."

10:38:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

10:38:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, okay. This sounds like a first thing in the morning task."

10:39:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Wel, here's the thing too, you are used to using the beacons between Mir and 77. Your speed is going to be slower. If it is indeed 20 lightyears, it might take you a couple of hours to even get out there, possibly more or less depending on the flow."

10:40:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm worried I'd want to sleep before I got there."

10:40:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I guess I could trim down to 1, right."

10:41:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But sleeping on the way there is probably a bad idea when I don't know exactly how far it is."

10:41:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well. Yeah you coul| trim down to 1, or even drop out and sleep while you drift, butyeah, sleeping while rifting can bite you hard if you don't know exactly how far it is."

10:41:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh man."

10:41:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "This is going to be the best."

10:42:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That, my man, is the fucking spirit. I love you for saying that."

10:42:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

10:43:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Don't fuck with the snowglobe if it pops up in your ship. It's ok to talk to it maybe, if you really want to, but I wouldn't handle it and definitely don't shake it."

10:44:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What happens if I shake it?"

10:44:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or put it down your pants, like Herrick did."

10:44:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

10:44:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You laugh, but I'm serious."

10:44:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What became of Herrick?"

10:45:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It took his penis. No wound or anything, but he carried the thing around in a cooler till he could get it reattached."

10:45:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Because he put it down his pants."

10:45:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone gasps.

10:45:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well to be honest that was a really weird thing for him to do."

10:45:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, I agree."

10:46:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "%t never did anything that bad to me. But all I did was ever talk to it. Worst thing it ever did to me was eat some stuff in my ship, and then spit it out all fused together. It also tok herrick's workbench once, and made it appear on someone elses ship."

10:46:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, so this is like a rift entity?"

10:47:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah."

10:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think anyone hasa seen it |n a while."

10:48:49 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Who blew up?"

10:48:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, I need to finish this mission I'm on. And we'll talk more."

10:49:07 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

10:49:08 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not me? I hope?"

10:49:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Did I hear something about a snowglobe making someone into a eunuch?"

10:49:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but reversibly."

10:49:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So."

10:50:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "=es, but I can't talk more about it right now. From wht I understand, it didn't hurt anything but his pride."

10:50:43 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "It was Tara Flores apparently."

10:50:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh no, what happened?"

10:50:59 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "No idea."

10:51:20 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "When was this?"

10:51:29 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Her pod landed just now."

10:51:34 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Aww."

10:51:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Last I heard, she was rifting somewhere. Maybe she fell asleep mid-rift?"

10:51:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "More likely she dropped out in 777 and there were pirates."

10:52:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But who knows."

10:52:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, at least she got capital insurance."

10:52:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's supposed to be an auto-lander."

10:53:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, well I hope this isn't my fault. I didn't see anything about an autolander on Lily's list of stuff for me to make."

11:43:00 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "The Fringe has far more worlds."

11:49:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

12:14:45 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hello."

12:14:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hello, and goodnight."

12:15:14 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "Good night."

12:15:23 [General Communication] Egil Aurstad transmits, "And hello."

12:15:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good luck on your trip constantine, I gotta get some sleep. If you're not back we'll try to com efind ya."

12:15:31 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. If anyone is hunting for it, I will build the xeno when I wake up. I'm way too tired now."

12:16:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Also,  try to be around tomorrow around 23:00 to midnigt, if you can."

12:16:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So like...in maybe 8 hours or so."

12:16:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sorry for the delay, but I've had stations to build every which way."

12:50:09 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

13:36:47 There appear to be about 9 pilots recently active.

13:36:47 The communicator network detects:

13:36:58 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

13:36:58 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

13:37:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well that's upsetting."

13:37:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Tara and what's up?"

13:37:59 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, I just woke up so I haven't had time to blow up yet."

13:38:09 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Chucke."

13:38:14 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

13:38:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Dreamseeker blew up. I fell asleep. At least I insured her."

13:38:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awww, I'm sorry."

13:39:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What kind of ship was it?"

13:40:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It was my scout ship. What happened was I took the rift to 777 and a ship blew it up after I had dozed off."

13:40:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So, no more rifting for me when im unsure ill stay concious."

13:40:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yikes, there must have been pirates or something there at 777."

13:47:03 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

13:47:03 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

13:47:14 You peer out...

13:47:14 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.

13:47:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, I'll be there."

13:48:01 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

13:48:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Nah I got 'em."

13:48:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

13:48:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

13:48:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

13:48:17 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Frontier Cluster. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

13:48:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

13:51:46 [Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Orion clear."

13:52:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh! I see."

13:52:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

13:52:04 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

13:52:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

13:52:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

13:52:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "They must have seen how mighty Rhino was with her one laser turret and fled."

13:52:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

13:52:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Apparently."

13:52:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

13:52:27 You pull a large lever towards you.

13:52:27 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

13:52:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

13:52:59 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

13:53:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Woah, Thanks Shule!"

13:53:13 Please enter a valid channel to transmit on.

13:53:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You are most welcome. Hope that helps."

14:08:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, I mean buy one."

14:08:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh."

14:10:49 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

14:10:49 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

14:13:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "You'll actually find that you won't need a tug as much as you think you will. It's also more of a risk than it might be worth depending on what you use it for."

14:14:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I hardly ever use my tug."

14:14:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Oh, I just prefer having all of my ships at one location and going off to pick a ship up means leaving another behind."

14:14:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I use my carrier more often."

14:14:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I only use my tug to save people."

14:14:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not necessarily, not if you use the ITPN more."

14:14:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Or ask for a lift."

14:15:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Or as Shule said, use a carrier. That's much more secure than a tug."

14:16:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah I could buy the hyperion carrier."

14:16:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, not that one."

14:16:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Its the only one I've points for, sadly."

14:16:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

14:17:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, you could ask us for help too. We have carriers. Shule probably has his docking bay upgraded too, just like me. I also have an EAOS combat support carrier which can hold more vessels."

14:18:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, we do have carriers."

14:18:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah. That'd be appreciated. I need to transport Rhino to new earth."

14:18:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "From BIkura."

14:19:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Want to grab it, Shule?"

14:19:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Sure. I can."

14:19:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks!"

14:21:42 You knock calmly upon the hull of the two-person light transport "Rhino".

14:21:55 You notice a bright flash of light above; a starship must be coming in for a landing.

14:22:05 The scout "Dreamseeker II" touches down smoothly on the ground.

14:22:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Can probably fit the scout in there too. You have the upgrade, right Shule?"

14:22:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep."

14:22:35 Tara Flores exits from the scout "Dreamseeker II".

14:22:39 You say, "I can ock both."

17:59:47 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

17:59:48 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

17:59:51 Not much to see out there.

18:09:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, I guess every single one of them must be outside the ship, but even that seems a little off."

18:23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's fine, it's not really any secret at this point. And I don't think they're even worried about the broadcasts anymore."

18:24:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Anyways, what time?"

18:25:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It'll be around 23:00, possibly midnight. This is if I can get everything in order, of course. If I think I'm not going to be able to do I'll let you know as soon as possible."

18:25:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, sounds good. Midnight would work better for me."

18:26:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, I'll keep that in mind. Was trying to do it an hour early so the folks leaving tonight wouldn't have to miss it, but if they do then I suppose that's not really our problem."

21:35:06 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

21:35:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

21:40:54 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

21:48:23 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:48:23 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:48:24 I don't understand that.

21:48:26 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:48:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:48:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:48:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:48:49 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:48:49 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:48:50 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

21:48:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:48:55 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:48:56 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:48:56 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

21:49:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:49:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:49:02 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:49:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just based on that attitude alone, you are invited on any expiditions I do in the future. HOpefully sooner rather than later, unfortunately, there's just too much going on right now for me and so my trip has had to take a back seat. I'm still getting things ready for it though."

21:49:04 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:49:23 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

21:49:26 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:49:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thank you. I hope to host my own trips in the future too."

21:49:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:49:49 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

21:49:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

21:49:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

21:50:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

Subject: Telepathic Felo
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 13:46 22 July 2317 GST
--
This is not a trade, but an offer. I would like to see what's up with these felo, so am spreading the word. There is a breed of felo that has popped up that seems to be at least somewhat telepathic. Sometimes when they eat, those nearby will see an image in their mind of the plant that used to be their main food source on Grenwold. They show some other traits too, staring intently at one another and at us. I have been breeding them and have at least two that I know for sure that are kittens at the moment of writing. If anyone is interested in helping me figure out if there's anything other than the telepathy with these guys...if perhaps they can lead us to a way to help them be healthier...please let me know in a letter. I repeat that this is an offer and I am not charging for these guys. If you want to make one a pet, you will need to purchase tonic at the Torus.

22:42:44 Not much to see out there.

22:42:47 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:42:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:42:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "On new earth, I mean."

22:42:54 You peer out...

22:42:55 
[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" and the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Red 4" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, a trash can, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.

22:42:57 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:43:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ther<'s on{ in Landfall."

22:43:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-Fringe non-aggression pact."

22:43:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:43:03 The computer reports that the one-person flitter "Fringe Navy Flitter Corps Orange 3" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

22:43:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:43:14 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

22:43:14 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:43:15 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

22:43:18 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:43:20 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:43:21 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:43:21 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

22:43:22 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

22:43:23 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

22:43:25 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

22:43:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

22:43:26 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

22:43:29 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Firestorm! Welcome to home space!"

22:43:38 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 682" has jumped out of the sector.

22:43:58 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

22:43:59 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

22:44:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Firestorm. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:44:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:44:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:44:15 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:44:15 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

22:44:16 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

22:44:16 You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:44:17  You are wearing a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt, a pair of slim Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers.

22:44:55 [New Phoenix; Mexico Lane]

22:44:56 The scent of Mexican foods drifts toward you from the northwest. The AEU's blackened tower looms above the smallish buildings here, but no one seems to pay it any mind. The buildings seem to be mainly restaurants and wholesale shops. Even though the entire area is rather dingy and poor-looking, as if the colonists from the third world areas of Old Earth simply recreated their old life here on new soil, it seems to have suffered little from the war. Business is lively and the sounds of conversation in old languages can be heard all along the street.

22:46:03 You say, "Minute."

22:46:08 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Make it take less time in future."

22:46:13 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "Anyway."

22:46:16 You nod.

22:46:43 Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa says, "What I'm about to tell you is not to be repeated outside of this room, not even to Lily. I can't confirm after all, if your apartment or ships are not bugged."

22:46:54 You nod. "I'll keep it to myself."

22:50:45 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

22:50:50 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

22:50:50 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought maybe everyone would be all like, "What's this about a sandiwch? What kind of sandwich? What kind of bread are you using? What are you going to do with this so-called sandwich?""

22:50:55 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of iron.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The one-person skimmer "Unreality Programming 402" and the three-person clipper "Firestorm" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

23:06:59 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

23:07:04 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:07:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:07:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:07:38 I don't understand that.

23:07:38 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:07:45 I don't understand that ("m" is an ambiguous name).

23:07:51 The starship is already moving.

23:08:30 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

23:08:31 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

23:08:39 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

23:08:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Sandbagger.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

23:08:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

23:08:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

23:08:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:08:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:14:46 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Not A Target Drone!". The organization has earned 722,406.51 credits.

23:17:58 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:17:59 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:25:54 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

23:25:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Sandbagger, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

23:25:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:26:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:26:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

23:26:22 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:26:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:26:28 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
