00:42 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Tobias."

00:43 Katina Faye
She appears to be 23 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has caramel skin. Her body is voluptuous with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and a large bust. Her face is heart-shaped and lovely, with a button nose and elegant fine chin. Her lips are full soft and rosebud pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is shiny black and loosely styled and left to fall freely down her back. She has oval light pink fingernails. She has a shimmering gold barrette inset with small pearls in her hair. She has a small interestingly-shaped birthmark on her neck.
A tiny tinkling silver bell on a silver ring pierces her right earlobe and a tiny tinkling silver bell on a silver ring pierces her left earlobe.
 She is wearing a sexy smoke gray halterneck top with a sweetheart neckline, a pair of relaxed-fit blue jeans with topaz and clear jeweled flower petals on the front and back pockets, and a pair of black silk flats. She is also wearing a delicate ring of silver wire and small yellow citrine crystals, a sparkly silver purse shaped like a crescent moon, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a deep imperial red fleur-de-lys ring, and a cinnamon brown touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster. Her head, face, both eyes, neck,

00:49 Star Conquest Help: POSE Command
--
Category: Communication
--
The POSE command is similar to EMOTE in that it helps you depict your character's body language. Unlike an emote, however, a pose lasts until you cancel it, and anyone entering or looking at the room will see your current pose. This pose will also show up if someone takes your photograph.

In the same way that SIT CHAIR will depict your character sitting in a chair, using a pose will depict your character in a certain way until you change it. You may want your character leaning against a wall, or eyeing everyone who enters the room, or working on a sketch. Anything that makes sense for your character is fair game!

To use the command, simply type POSE. It will present you with a list of preset options. You may also choose to write a custom pose by choosing option #1 from the menu.

You can also set your pose in one command, simply by typing POSE followed by whatever you would like your pose to be. You can cancel your pose quickly by typing POSE CANCEL. If your pose involves sitting or lying down, standing up will cancel it automatically.

Keep in mind that all poses are in the form of "[name] is [doing a pose]." So, for example:

Right: pose leaning against the wall.
What Others See: Jim is leaning against the wall.

Wrong: pose leans against the wall.
What Others See: Jim is leans against the wall.

01:23  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:23 You are carrying nothing.

01:23 Damien looks over at Katina and smiles. "Hm?"

01:23 Katina says to Damien, "Oh, just saw your thoughtful look, was a bit curious sorry."

01:24 Damien Alexander puts a cup in a midnight blue trash bin.

01:24 Katina's eyes sparkle deviously as she says to you, "You cannot escape this sir. I have my guitar."

01:24 You hear the soft clink of glasses as a waiter pours out glasses of spiced maple wine.

01:24 Katina nods softly to Damien.

01:25 Katina gives you a warm playful smile.

01:25 You chuckle. "Well, my guitar playing might distract us form the already lovely music that's playing."

01:25 You grin at Katina Faye.

01:25 Katina Faye asks, "Oh sure, not here, I understand, later though. Yes?"

01:28 Damien Alexander grins at Katina Faye. "Aha, the truth comes out."

01:28 Katina lets out a soft tinkling laugh.

01:28 The smooth jazz in the background gets quieter as a soft flute improvises on the melody.

01:29 Damien holds a small glass of maple wine up in front of him. "To Katina, an' her great idea of coming out here ta relax an' have fun."

01:29 Katina Faye blushes.

01:35 Damien Alexander smiles at Katina Faye.

01:35 A man in a chef's hat comes out of the kitchen and surveys the customers, seeming pleased as he returns to the kitchen.

01:36 Katina bites her lip to tame a blush and says in a shy tone, "Oh."

01:36 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "QE message transfer to Nocturnal Flight complete."

01:36 You say, "It's been well over a year since I've played guitar and sung for anyone."

01:37 Katina says to you, "A song?"

01:38 Katina Faye asks, "What happened?"

01:38 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Common Knowledge.

01:38 Michael Kennedy navigates his royal blue touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

01:38 Shule nods sadly, "The last time I sang and played guitar."

01:38 Katina Faye says, "Ah."

When dealing with the stations and firing at incoming asteroids that are on a path to hit X station. Is it just small rocks or can the chunks be Grenwold sized? Are Grenwold sized chunks too much for the station to handle?

01:47 This wide corridor serves as a showcase for Nouveau Quebec's artist community. With displays of everything from vivid free-form paintings covering the original gray metal walls to fantastic towering paper-based statues and elaborate metal sculptures, this open-air representation of the most avant garde of artistic expression draws locals, some of whom seem quite loudly indignant at this waste of their tax credits, while others gaze fondly upon the creations of their favorite artists. Still others seem to be here merely on their way to somewhere else. The entrance to the Ministère de la Culture is here, its artfully decorated doorway surrounded by brightly colored notices.

02:13 Damien frowns at a slim dark red softcover book with the title printed in white and centered on the cover and scratches his chin.

02:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:14 Katina gazes curiously at Damien out of the corner of her eye then returns her gaze towards the trees once more.

02:14 Damien Alexander puts a slim dark red softcover book with the title printed in white and centered on the cover in a gunmetal gray canvas messenger bag.

02:17 A group of school children in blue and white uniforms quietly follows their teacher down the corridor toward the south.

02:17 Katina leans back leisurely, and a soft contented sigh escapes from between her lips.

02:18 A worker in syrup splattered coveralls walks by, pausing at the cart to buy a warm cookie before continuing on her way.

02:19 Michael Kennedy takes a sip of a frosted glass of very cold maple ice cider.

02:19 A bird trills on one side of the path, and you catch the flutter of yellow wings as another bird in a tree on the other side answers with a similar song.

02:21 The aroma of warm maple syrup drifts down the corridor.

02:27 Katina Faye stands up from an ornate black iron bench.

02:27 [Nouveau Quebec; Tree District]

02:27 Down the center of this corridor is a painted path of pale orange paving stones lined on either side with young maple trees growing straight and true from wells of soil amid patches of grass along the path. Behind the real trees are paintings of a forested countryside where, behind the many maple trees, the spires of tall evergreens appear here and there against the azure blue sky. Citizens and tourists alike stroll along, admiring the scenery and occasionally glancing upward at the sound of trilling bird calls in the trees. The scent of maple syrup fills the air, courtesy of a small cart at the side of the path where maple-flavored treats are sold.

02:29 Damien Alexander says, "I should probably get myself a room fer the night."

02:30 You nod and grin.

02:30 An elderly couple strolls arm-in-arm down the corridor, contented smiles on their wrinkled faces.

02:31 You say, "Yeah, sleeping out here wouldn't be the most comfortable."

02:31 Damien Alexander stops sitting on an ornate black iron bench, his legs stretched out in front of him.

22:07 
[Nouveau Quebec; Tree District]
The north end of Liberty Avenue is here amid a painted forest of maple trees presented in every season across the vertical metal walls. Flanking the entrance of the Ministry of Trees here are two especially beautiful trees, their leafy green boughs overhanging the doorway. At the apex of the domed ceiling is the sun, a great round yellow lamp with wavy streamers of solar flares painted around it. Wide corridors lead away to the northeast and northwest, each with an elaborate metalwork sign overhead, though the largest and most imposing sign hangs over the arched entrance to an area to the north whence come the rustle of leaves, the sound of bird calls, and the faint scent of maple syrup. A harrowing ladder leads up to another chamber.

Down the center of this corridor is a painted path of pale orange paving stones lined on either side with young maple trees growing straight and true from wells of soil amid patches of grass along the path. Behind the real trees are paintings of a forested countryside where, behind the many maple trees, the spires of tall evergreens appear here and there against the azure blue sky. Citizens and tourists alike stroll along, admiring the scenery and occasionally glancing upward at the sound of trilling bird calls in the trees. The scent of maple syrup fills the air, courtesy of a small cart at the side of the path where maple-flavored treats are sold.
