00:43:01 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "On my way."

00:43:02 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:43:02 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:43:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Crap. 10 minutes."

00:43:12 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:43:12 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Chetumal Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:43:12 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:43:13 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Fringe."

00:43:14 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

00:43:16 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:43:18 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:43:19 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:43:20 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.
[Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "What is going on?"

00:43:20 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

00:43:21 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Damien you're flying though. I can't fly against all that."

00:43:21 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:43:23 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:43:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:43:25 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:43:28 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

00:43:31 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

00:43:31 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Chetumal.

00:43:34  You are wearing a short-sleeved navy and white madras plaid cotton shirt, a pair of light khaki cotton twill chinos, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:43:34 You are carrying nothing.

00:43:34 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:43:36 The computer reports that the luxury sightseer "Hummingbird's Migration" has landed on the planet Chetumal.

00:43:40 [Tactical Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "A ton of pirates. Crewing at chetumal."

00:43:44 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Do y'all need me or no? If ya got crew in under 10 I'll just go back and bring the carrier in."

00:43:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:43:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:43:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The Fringe welcomes you to the city of Chetumal City under the non-aggression pact."

00:43:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:43:53 [Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "A ton of pirates where?"

00:43:56 I don't understand that.

00:43:58 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

00:43:59 [Tactical Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hamiltons' Funnel."

00:44:01 [Tactical Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Just got back into comms range."

00:44:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:44:03 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:44:03 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:44:04 You scramble to your feet.

00:44:23 You peer out...

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:04:09 Evenia Callseah nods.

01:04:13 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

01:04:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:05:50 [Starship "Brahms Away"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a decoy beacon launcher and Orby the security hoverbot here.

01:06:01 [Starship "Brahms Away"; Weapons Room Three]

01:06:01 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.
You see a swiveling dark blue leather gunner's chair here.

01:30:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It would, But attackin a fringe pilot and the Accord peacekeepers don't further his image he's tryin to make of bein some Robin Hood. Robin Hood didn't just destroy stuff. He also did a lot of good for the poor."

01:30:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Morris did. And he got himself into a nice little box there for a bit. He's lucky they weren't better trained."

01:32:16 Erik Goodwin's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I figured cornering a single ship with a larger force would be a way to set up for a stealing."

01:32:36 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "He would have blown Michael up given the opportunity. Not stolen the ship."

01:34:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:34:58 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We'll go check and see if there are any more there."

01:35:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:35:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:35:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:35:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:35:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:35:50 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:35:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:36:14 [Starship "Brahms Away"; Airlock]

01:36:15 You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:36:18 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:36:19 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:36:20 The communications systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

01:36:33 [Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]

01:36:33 Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

01:39:42 You wave to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

01:39:46 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his peculiar milky-blue metachannel FTL communicator:

01:39:50 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, sounds like a good plan mostly."

01:39:55 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Umm."

01:39:57 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his peculiar milky-blue metachannel FTL communicator:

01:39:58 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "At least for the Union folks."

01:40:07 [Manhattan Spaceport; Pilot Lounge]

01:40:08 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
You can go out.

01:40:14 You sit down on a comfortable wooden chair.

01:40:27 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So...what. You think he was bein all nice and friendly by attackin a Fringe pilot and the Accord peacekeepers so y'all Union folks could have somethin to do or somethin?"

01:40:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't say anything remotely close to that."

01:41:02 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "You said it sounds like a good plan, at least for the union folks."

01:41:07 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Or did I hear that wrong?"

01:41:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "To fight our oppressors and for the freedom of our communicties? Yeah."

01:41:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And how does him attackin a Fringe pilot and Accord peacekeepers further that?"

01:42:10 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I didn't do either of those things."

01:42:15 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "He did."

01:42:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was on the cruiser with you, fighting them, remember?"

01:42:29 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eli...I'm talkin about what he di."

01:42:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did."

01:42:48 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ya can't take just his words without the actions factorin into it."

01:43:19 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

01:43:20 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If he'd said all that without that big show of force it'd be different. But he didn't."

01:43:20 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Morris, quit trying to pick a fight."

01:43:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You're acting like I cheered for him or something."

01:43:34 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No, I'm just tryin to understand your statement."

01:43:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "My statement was abou thim saying we should fight our oppressors and me saying yeah."

01:43:57 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I never take a person's words at face value. If they try to talk the talk, but not walk the walk, we have a problem. Or two."

01:44:04 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thanks Jacob."

01:44:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's all I'm tryin to say."

01:44:17 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the five-person A.S.S. tactical platform "William Dove".

01:44:19 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes a recent find in deep space.

01:44:24 You can't read a secondary pilot command access unit.

01:44:29 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I'm here Love."

01:44:32 You put a secondary pilot command access unit in a leather briefcase.

01:45:09 You say to Lily, "Mind taking me to Chetumal so I can get my flare?"

01:45:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok want to go by new earth to check the office and things."

01:45:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:45:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-League non-aggression pact."

01:45:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:45:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Is that ok?"

01:45:28 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:45:33 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't suppose anyone could give me a ride back to Chetumal to get my ship."

01:45:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:45:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

01:45:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:45:41 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:45:42 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:45:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:45:46 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Where are you now?"

01:45:47 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:45:48 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:45:48 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:45:49 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:54:34 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:54:34 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:54:37 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:54:39 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:54:40 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:54:41 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:54:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:54:42 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:54:44 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:54:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:54:45 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:54:48 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Kalina! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:54:59 AutoStar detects 4 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:55:00 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

01:55:03 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:55:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Erm. Wasn't it not that long ago that he used to attack your area of space too?"

01:55:27 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What has he actually stolen from you?"

01:55:34 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:55:35 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:55:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Kalina. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:55:40 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:55:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:55:55 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:56:08 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:56:08 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:56:09 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

01:56:09 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:56:09 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The four-person light carrier "Kalina" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

01:56:09 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "What do you even own that he's stolen? The answer is you don't own those ships, you don't own those materials. You're drones. You own nothing."

01:56:15 A crane efficiently unloads the two-person flare "Deadly Strike" from the four-person light carrier "Kalina".

01:56:21 [The Torus; Garage]

01:56:21 You can go up.

01:56:23 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:56:23 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:56:25 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:56:25 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

01:56:28 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:56:40 Your ship 'Kalina' has been automatically moved into a garage.

01:57:40 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Police Reveal Note Delivered to New Scotland Yard Prior to Museum Theft: 'Sorry for all the trouble, but it will look so good next to my cruiser I couldn't resist. K.'"

01:58:18 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Oh. I had no Idea I was a drone. Thanks for the heads up."

02:00:12 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You owned that?"

02:00:20 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:00:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The museum did."

02:01:52 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "The question was what has he stolen from you?"

02:02:02 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Don't say it was a cake."

02:02:30 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I do remember that cake."

02:03:01 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I'll even drop my accent for a bit. He's blown up my ships a couple of times. More to the point, I work for an alliance, which means their enemies are my enemies too."

02:03:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He hasn't taken anything personally away from me except for the Scout that Iloved, but doubtless you'll point out that I didn't own that ship in the first place. I'm only trying to figure out how stealing from some people, and not others, means someone isn't a thief. You kinda have to not steal from everyone to do that."

02:04:05 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "You do not own any of your ships. They are, in essence, long-term rentals."

02:04:11 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "That's not brainwashing, Cheri, that's loyalty, and pilots have been thrown in jail for breaking that loyalty."

02:04:15 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "This may come as a shock to you."

02:04:21 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:04:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not really, as Ijust said that."

02:04:41 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "In that sense, Agnarr is particularly honest with his long-term rentalling."

02:05:19 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Vote Agnarr."

02:05:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Agnarr is fun at parties."

02:06:01 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "So if they're only long-term rentals, how long is the period of rent? Aside from it being cut off when or if we retire, I need a date as to when I can be expected to return the ships I paid for. Just for informational purposes, you understand."

02:07:21 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "They are until you are no longer useful as a pet to your master, or whenever your master deems fit."

02:08:00 [General Communication] Jacob snickers softly.

02:08:21 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

02:08:42 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "It is truly sad that regs accept all chains, but refuse to acknowledge their presence, as if they will go away if you think that they are not binding or restrictive."

02:09:13 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "No comment."

02:09:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Remind me why stupid people exist again?"

02:09:31 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It all depends on who's doing the stealing whether it's good or bad."

02:10:08 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You're loyal to the governments that keep you enslaved, wonderful."

02:10:15 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Look, I know that y'all have flipped from being crazy anti-Kelsey to super pro-Kelsey, but what exactly do you expect us to do?"

02:10:50 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Open your damn eyes."

02:10:53 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm loyal to how I personally feel about it. I just happen to agree with my government. I make my own decisions. I don't change 'em 'cause a non-aggression pact is signed."

02:10:58 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "If he wants to sit down and have a conversation with us and the government, by all means, please arrange it."

02:11:37 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "My eyes are wide open. Are yours?"

02:11:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "To infuriate those who have superior complexes in their own intelligence."

02:11:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What the."

02:11:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields laughs.

02:12:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm not the smartest person in the universe. But I'm smart enough. I think."

02:12:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

02:12:49 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I do not agree with many actions of the fellow, but I am sure he would be great gentleman during such conversation."

02:13:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am pressed to ask, What am I missing exactly? Or... tuned upon?"

02:13:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "For sure."

02:13:47 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yeah, apparently Takana said he was great to talk to, from what I hear."

02:14:21 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

02:14:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "So have a buncha serial killers throughout history from what I've read."

02:15:22 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

02:15:29 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. either way, I'm still a little disappointed that the guy doesn't have a monocle."

02:15:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

02:15:49 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Why? Should he have one?"

02:15:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It just like.. shattered my whole perception."

02:15:59 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "You're obsessed with that image, eli."

02:16:25 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Belated greetings, Evenia. How're you?"

02:16:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "So... what's happening? Anyone doing anything of remote interest? I bought a fighter and not certain I want to... how is that saying go? "...scratch the paint." on it yet."

02:16:35 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Unfortunate limitation of wearing ever changing holomask, maybe."

02:16:47 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Not bad Jacob, yourself?"

02:17:17 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Whatever, he's not hurting you pilots, think about it."

02:17:36 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Who's hurting what pilots?"

02:19:01 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Stop mouthing the words they write for you, think for yourself."

02:19:18 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Pardon?"

02:19:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think for myself. If the League signed a non-aggression pact with Kelsey, I'd still detest him. I just wouldn't shoot at him."

02:19:34 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I would be curious on how many sentient beings Monsieur Kelsey is at least somewhat responsible for demise of. I would be surprised if number was that high, to be honest."

02:19:43 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Wait wait.. so me saying that bacon is awesome isn't thinking for myself? whaaa?"

02:19:51 [General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.

02:20:33 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."

02:20:46 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Yo."

02:21:11 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am mildly curious, as since this seems to be a very public conversation. Would someone care to fill me in? It's pretty dull painting hulls of ships."

02:22:21 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

02:22:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We're not up to much because most of the alliance is on strike against our oppressive government. We're not pressuring new pilots to join in of course, we all know how it is when you are fresh out of pilot school."

02:23:17 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "They tell you who you can kill, who you need to hate, and you do it."

02:23:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Care to meet to discuss this and why? Also... what's the difference between capital insurance and exploration insurance?"

02:23:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't even chime in on any of this because this is kind of how I do actually fel about my government at the moment."

02:24:02 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I am very careful about not killing anyone."

02:24:17 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "And hey, Kelsey's ships aren't his either."

02:24:21 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:24:22 [General Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I hate killing myself. Killing is bad."

02:24:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just 'cause I agree with 'em bout some things don't mean I'm brainwashed."

02:25:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Wow this Triggs or twiggs guy or whatever his name is, sounds like Vernos brother!"

02:26:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok i'm going to move some soldiers from daisy may into the other ship and wait to see if they thrive and then in a couple of days I'll put the rest of them in there."

02:27:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sure, let me come to New Earth. And captial insurance is basically the best you can get, exploration I think is much the same, although it will still pay out if your insurance gets dropped due to you being on an expidition or something."

02:27:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They way it's still covered if the ship gets blown up in deep space."

02:28:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah, ok. Yeah, he kind of does."

02:29:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Huh. It's 3000 in difference. The capital being more, or course. Which, is funny, considering."

02:30:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The exploration one might not payout as much."

02:31:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Claims pay out is 75%, just like the capital. Wonder if there is a loophole regarding the exploration insurance.."

02:39:33 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Question for Cheri and Pierre... did you guys used to say Kelsey is horrible?"

02:40:22 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

02:40:33 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:40:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

02:41:00 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:41:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says to you, "Oops is Deadly powered up?"

02:41:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

02:41:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll go check and power down."

02:41:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

02:41:39 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:41:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nope it's not."

02:41:55 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:41:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

02:41:59 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:42:04 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "No, I used to say and still say that common pirates are horrible, but even way back I realized Kelsey isn't a common pirate."

02:42:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:42:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:43:22 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

02:43:44 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I seem to remember that. Thanks! Seemed silly to argue about it amongst ourselves when you're right there."

02:44:28 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:44:29 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "He has some kind of agenda, I don't remember the particulars."

02:44:31 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:44:32 There are three board posts.

Return to the category menu? [Enter `yes' or `no']

02:44:47 You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

02:45:14 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Anyway, yeah just ask me."

02:45:22 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

02:46:24 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "What was your opinion on Takana Noki when all that went down? It's before my time, so I'm a little fuzzy on the details."

02:46:38 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I don't know, what happened?"

02:47:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

02:47:21 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits an irritating burst of static.

02:49:07 [General Communication] "What was you came to do?" Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "I didn't see you do anything."

02:49:22 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, purring softly.

02:49:27 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "To say hi. A moment of moral support."

02:49:35 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "And thanks for the package."

02:50:02 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "And now back to hiding in my ship."

02:50:08 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Aww."

02:51:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

02:51:54 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I hide in stealth galleon for maximum hideness."

02:52:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:52:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey Eli did you take the plaques with you when you left yesterday morning?"

02:53:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:53:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily sighs and if not either the spaceport workers didn't like our peaceful protest or those dumb sanitation drones grabbed them.

02:54:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I still see all of them."

02:55:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You just have to really look around."

02:55:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:55:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ah ok will do."

02:55:34 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:55:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Going to go look."

02:55:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

02:55:47 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:55:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:56:03 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:56:03 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:56:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:56:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

02:56:15 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:56:16 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

02:56:19 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:56:21 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 411" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:56:21 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:56:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:56:22 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:56:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

02:56:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:56:25 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

02:56:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:56:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:56:27 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:56:30 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

02:56:30 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, William Dove! Welcome to home space!"

02:56:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button on the FTL drive tracer control board.

02:56:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances at the resulting list of recent FTL drive traces.

02:56:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh! Glad you liked that."

02:56:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:56:42 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

02:56:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:56:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, took me a second."

02:57:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:57:18 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

02:57:22 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet "Mrrp.".

02:57:23 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, William Dove. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

02:57:23 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

02:57:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes the soft fur of Mischief the large black felo.

02:57:27 Mischief the large black felo purrs and rubs its head against Lily's hand, looking up at her adoringly.

02:57:33 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

02:57:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident pulls a large lever towards her.

02:57:35 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:57:38 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

02:57:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

02:57:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident scrambles to her feet.

02:57:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

02:57:45 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:58:30 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hey there Kelsey, if you are around. Would you pull out of the Accord if you ran the AEU?"

02:58:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident whistles.

02:58:57 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Everyone knows pulling out does not work."

02:59:04 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

02:59:20 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Buy quality wrappers of the Nouveau Quebec, now with extra big nose on Premier."

03:05:22 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

03:11:23 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Are there any three breasted women that would like to date Morris?"

03:11:33 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Asking for a friend. Morris."

03:12:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

03:12:22 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:12:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Who is this friend? It will forever be a mystery."

03:13:46 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

03:13:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

03:13:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:13:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

03:14:07 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:14:15 Lily says to an alliance information assistant, "Just went to greet that new guy. He isn't too scarey."

03:14:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:15:00 Lily says to you, "So."

03:15:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Jacob went on one of those missions."

03:15:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:15:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "He didn't die!"

03:15:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He said he actually found nothing and used his scanner but found nothing."

03:15:47 You grin at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:15:58 You say, "Oh wo."

03:16:01 You say, "Huh."

03:16:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So they may not turn out that bad but since i"m allergic to work right now, I'm not going."

03:16:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:16:22 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender.

03:16:58 You laugh.

03:18:22 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

03:18:23 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

03:20:22 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

03:22:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's neck.

03:30:19 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:32:22 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles swims around a plastic flower with red petals.

03:33:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:34:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

03:34:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

03:34:22 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:37:22 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

03:38:23 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:39:09 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:39:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

03:39:25 Lily says to you, "I love you."

03:39:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

03:39:33 You say to Lily, "I love you too."

03:39:36 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

03:39:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

03:40:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Would you want to go up and hangout a little while with the others in the Lounge?"

03:40:56 You get a distant look on your face as you ponder. "I probably could for maybe a few minutes, but I'll be a bit distracted."

03:41:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh it's ok."

03:41:22 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

03:41:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Just go say hello and hang out for a half our or so and then we'll come back ok?"

03:41:40 You grin. "Sounds great."

03:41:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:41:46 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

03:41:51 You join Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's group.

03:41:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident disbands her group.

03:41:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:42:01 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident joins your group.

03:42:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:42:08 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

03:42:08 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, and Mischief the large black felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

03:42:09 You exit the ship.

03:42:10 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

03:42:14 [New Earth; Pilot Lounge]

03:42:15 You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, Souleater the little striped orange CatBot, Orby the security hoverbot, a personal hoverpallet, a grand piano with a black finish, and a padded black stool here.
Jacob Shields is sitting on a padded black stool. Tanny Hill, Rogue Pilot Eli Grey, and Johnathon Triggs are sitting on a slim and fashionable couch.
You can go out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident followed you.

03:42:19 Tanny Hill removes a metallic black bass guitar from a black guitar case.

03:42:22 You wave.

03:42:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves.

03:42:25 Jacob Shields waves.

03:42:25 Johnathon Triggs says, "So, I spoke with the Liason Officer. He said "get out there and go hunt RATS. They're great for praticing.""

03:42:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yay."

03:42:34 Jacob Shields nods.

03:42:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on a slim and fashionable couch.

03:42:42 Jacob Shields says, "And they're easy to kill for the most part."

03:42:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a hot cup of espresso.

03:42:56 Johnathon says to Jacob, "Easy to find them?"

03:42:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident orders a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

03:43:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

03:43:10 Tanny Hill says, "If you need to do work, at least do it for SVP, they're a division of Accord."

03:43:12 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Check um.. dustry Reaches, or even the old frontier."

03:43:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods.

03:43:19 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah."

03:43:39 Johnathon says to Tanny, "SVP? Accord?"

03:43:39 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep Space Vermin is the place! But do all of the tasks that the Liaison wants you to do as well."

03:43:46 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Just jump to space vermin command, that's a good way to do some early pilot work and still be supporting the Accord."

03:43:52 Jacob Shields nods.

03:43:58 Jacob Shields says, "I still do this stuff myself."

03:44:05 Jacob Shields says, "Easy and it gets me cash."

03:44:20 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Where is space vermin command?"

03:44:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then when you are ready to do Ground Combat, there are books in a box in the Conference Room on Ground Combat."

03:44:22 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:44:27 Eli nods and grins at Lily and you.

03:44:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll also be here to answer questions too."

03:45:22 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

03:45:23 A pair of pilots begin riling each other up about the current government, then they grow silent, stare at each other for a moment, and quietly sit back down.

03:45:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:45:35 Eli sighs at the agnry pilots.

03:45:53 Tanny Hill says, "Space Vermin Patrol Command keeps everyone's space clear of menaces like giant space bugs and out of control robots, while Accord deals with things like malevolent aliens."

03:46:03 Lily points toward SShule and says now Shule is our amazing Space Combat expert.

03:46:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you.

03:46:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey asks, "Space bugs and out of control robots?"

03:46:21 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey smirks at Tanny Hill.

03:46:22 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:46:23 A pilot at a nearby table excitedly describes that time they almost decided to lead an expedition.

03:46:27 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

03:46:36 Tanny Hill exclaims, "That's basically what they are!"

03:46:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Tanny Hill.

03:46:55 Tanny Hill says, "I'm just a great pilot translator."

03:46:57 Tanny Hill beams.

03:47:00 Johnathon Triggs says, "I am still not hearing specifics for potential targets..."

03:47:07 Tanny Hill says, "Sorry."

03:47:22 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

03:47:25 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Where is Spacer Vermin Patrol command?"

03:47:30 Johnathon Triggs says, "And.. accord."

03:47:35 Tanny Hill says, "Just jump to them."

03:47:38 Johnathon Triggs nods.

03:47:39 Tanny Hill says, "In your ship."

03:47:47 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Jus tuse the starship and jump to them yeah."

03:47:51 You sit down on a slim and fashionable couch.

03:47:55 Johnathon says to Tanny, "Not through the stars, in a spacesuit?"

03:47:55 Jacob places his fingers on the keys of a grand piano with a black finish and begins to softly play it, a look of intence concentration etched upon his face.

03:47:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:47:58 Johnathon Triggs grins at Tanny Hill.

03:48:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

03:48:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

03:48:16 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "You can also just use jump by itself and get a selection of accessible choices, but Accord won't show up on that at first."

03:48:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a bite of a flaky iced pastry with chocolate cream filling.

03:48:30 Jacob says to Lily, "Good choice on the snack."

03:48:32 Johnathon Triggs nods.

03:48:39 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Also jumping to places like Old Frontier, and Dustry reaches are good places to look for RATS."

03:48:49 Johnathon Triggs nods.

03:49:14 Tanny listens intently to Jacob's melody.

03:49:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As well as Spinward, C-12 sometimes, Battle of Mir sometimes too."

03:49:38 Tanny says to Jacob, "What key's that in?"

03:50:04 Jacob continues to play a grand piano with a black finish and slightly moves his body from side to side as he does so. The music floating through the room is quiet and somber, yet with a slightly romantic mood.

03:50:19 Jacob Shields says, "I'm playing in d-major right now."

03:50:36 Johnathon Triggs asks, "What if there's none there, when I jump to the sector. I just wait around?"

03:50:52 Lily says to Johnathon, "You could but I'd move on and check others."

03:51:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "You can try a different one, or you can navigate out by flying to an edge and then moving off manually."

03:51:08 Johnathon Triggs nods.

03:51:21 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "But yeah, probably easier just to jump somewhere else that there might be RATS."

03:52:01 Tanny begins to pick at a metallic black bass guitar, creating a slow, steady bassline to underline Jacob.

03:52:03 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "And the folks at SVP will tell you where to go on their missions."

03:52:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep they sure will."

03:52:15 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey glances at Jacob Shields and glances at Tanny Hill and grins.

03:52:23 A seagull flaps by the window.

03:52:33 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "That damn seagull."

03:53:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I love that seagull. I always just worry it might injure itself by smacking its wings into the window."

03:53:04 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey places a metallic silver touch einrophone into a black leather phone holster.

03:53:07 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

03:53:16 Johnathon Triggs nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:53:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident takes a sip of a hot cup of espresso.

03:53:23 You hear the clank of something being dropped on the landing pad, followed by loud swearing.

03:53:27 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey speaks into his peculiar milky-blue metachannel FTL communicator:

03:53:27 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Battle of the lounges. Manhatten is one ahead."

03:53:40 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It's the better one, that's why."

03:53:45 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo."

03:53:47 Jacob's fingers dance lightly over the piano keys as Jacob.s performs a series of glistening arpeggios.

03:53:55 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well too bad Frontier isn't open as I love the Star Lounge."

03:54:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just no food."

03:54:01 Johnathon Triggs says, "Well. I best get to it. Hard to become an Ace, talking about it all night, in a lounge."

03:54:03 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

03:54:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at Johnathon Triggs.

03:54:11 Jacob Shields says, OOCly, "Fail. Stupid emote broke on me."

03:54:20 Lily says to Johnathon, "True that but we're glad to meet you."

03:54:26 Johnathon Triggs says, "Those kind of 'aces' are just ol' drunks."

03:54:28 Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

03:54:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:54:38 Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

03:54:42 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Johnathon Triggs.

03:54:48 Johnathon Triggs stands up from a slim and fashionable couch.

03:54:53 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Johnathon Triggs.

03:54:58 Eli says to Johnathon, "If you need any more help feel free to ask over the alliance line."

03:55:02 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey waves to Johnathon Triggs.

03:55:03 Johnathon Triggs nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:55:05 Lily says to Johnathon, "Have fun! Out there."

03:55:10 Jacob Shields nods to Johnathon Triggs.

03:55:15 Johnathon says to Lily, "Will do!"

03:55:22 I don't see that here.

03:55:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident squeezes you affectionately.

03:55:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Don't get eaten by space bugs, or out of control robots."

03:55:35 You wave to Johnathon Triggs.

03:55:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

03:55:38 Tanny is only a note behind on Jacob's arpeggios, fingers sliding smoothly down the neck of her guitar as it emits the deep, rich notes.

03:55:46 Johnathon says to Lily, "By the way.. from your prior remarks. I take it you take care of all the paperwork?"

03:55:48 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Or insectoid aliens."

03:56:00 Lily says to Johnathon, "Which paperwork?"

03:56:12 Johnathon says to Eli, "I'll hack the robots and make them serve me."

03:56:13 Johnathon Triggs grins at Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:56:14 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yes, yes. Please give all your paperwork to Lily."

03:56:19 You chuckle.

03:56:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Only on Ground Combat if that's the sort of work you're referring to?"

03:56:44 Lily noticeably cringes.

03:56:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:56:49 Tanny Hill begins sitting on a slim and fashionable couch, backing up Jacob's piano with her bass guitar.

03:56:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:56:52 You say to Eli, "No, then I'll have to deal with her after she goes through the piles of paperwork."

03:56:56 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

03:57:00 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah so spare us both!"

03:57:05 You laugh.

03:57:12 Johnathon says to Lily, "Oh, I was meaning Space combat. AS, at this moment, I don't have a battlesuit for ground combat."

03:57:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "He might kick me in the... shin!"

03:57:17 You chuckle.

03:57:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Johnathon Triggs. "Lily is the Ground Squad Leader, and Shule is the Space Defense Captain."

03:57:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

03:57:26 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "So they get different paperwork."

03:57:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

03:57:40 Johnathon Triggs says, "I see.."

03:57:41 Johnathon Triggs grins.

03:57:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I actually get very little paperwork and I rather like that."

03:57:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

03:57:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

03:57:55 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "They have completely different stamps."

03:57:58 Jacob slows the pace of he arpeggios and comes to a resting point on a ritch, warm d-major chord with alternating octaves in the left hand.

03:58:01 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins.

03:58:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:58:23 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

03:58:25 Johnathon Triggs says, "Yes.. I'll be definately pilling in on the paperwork for them both. And soon.. they'll be saying. Man, this guy is really amazing."

03:58:29 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey applauds at Tanny Hill and applauds at Jacob Shields.

03:58:36 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grins at Johnathon Triggs.

03:58:46 Johnathon Triggs says, "Though.. honestly, that could be taken two ways."

03:58:46 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Hopefully we'll all be joining you in that soon enough."

03:58:50 Johnathon Triggs laughs.

03:58:51 Jacob Shields nods.

03:59:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

03:59:19 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Then we're totally all going to do like, cruiser beacons and accord missions until we drop."

03:59:23 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

03:59:24 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "And nests."

03:59:33 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

03:59:40 Tanny strums out a final chord that harmonizes with Jacob, then grins at him.

03:59:47 Johnathon says to Eli, "Beacons? Where do we get those?"

03:59:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I play mostly acoustic and very old music which our family passed down from way back on Old Earth but I'm not as good with classical music."

04:00:21 "Those are on Accord Command." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods. "Might want to try a rental fighter from Tannhauser Gate if you are goign to try one of those this early though."

04:00:23 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

04:00:28 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

04:00:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:00:31 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "They're a bit more upgraded than the stock fighter."

04:00:36 Johnathon Triggs asks, "Or, are they only granted after so many space defense points are earned?"

04:00:41 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

04:00:44 Johnathon Triggs nods.

04:00:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And if you get destroyed, they won't affect our goals as much."

04:00:53 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I... don't know? I think you can do them right away."

04:01:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Did you all discuss Courier work and Mail deliveries?"

04:01:23 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into back stairway to the garage.

04:01:32 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I'm not sure, I spaced out a bit a while ago."

04:01:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

04:01:49 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey points at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "What she said."

04:01:58 Johnathon says to Lily, "I was by those offices earlier."

04:02:08 Jacob concludes his peace and removes his hands from a grand piano with a black finish's keyboard.

04:02:17 Johnathon says to Eli, "Your recommendations for courier services?"

04:02:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "You can request mail from the mail center, and you can also get a corporate job doing deliveries as a courier."

04:02:32 Lily says to Johnathon, "Well mail will get you a bit of good cash and Courier work only pays you a paycheck once per week but it's a good way to earn points."

04:02:32 Jacob Shields nods.

04:02:56 Johnathon Triggs nods.

04:03:08 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Well, personally, I work for Scientia over in the Muttering Deeps, on artifact Zeta, but you can work at any of the courier jobs that you want."

04:03:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I ran only Priority courier work until I got a Trannsport so now whenever I do courier, I just take freight."

04:03:18 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "There's Unrelaity Programming, right here in the spaceport."

04:03:23 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

04:03:26 Jacob Shields nods.

04:03:28 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Er.. Unreality Porgramming."

04:03:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Rogue Pilot Eli Grey.

04:03:37 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

04:03:47 Johnathon Triggs nods.

04:03:51 Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "Yeah freight actually pays a lot once you have a transport."

04:03:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah."

04:03:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

04:03:59 Jacob says to Tanny, "God this piano does sound lovely. They did a good job on the tuning and regulation in the shop."

04:04:23 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.

12:29:03 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:29:04 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:29:04 What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:29:05 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Chetumal Orbit."

12:29:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:29:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:29:10 The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

12:29:12 Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

12:29:39 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:29:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:29:51 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch
17:58:34 ow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

18:00:40 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

18:02:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "How do I fix my hull damage failsafes?"

18:02:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "They can only be repaired at a space port."

18:03:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Oh."

18:03:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So, land at New Earth or the like and go into the repair and rearm shop."

18:03:28 You scramble to your feet.

18:03:28 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

You can go east, southeast, and out.

18:03:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Where are you fighting?"

18:03:44 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

18:03:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:03:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:03:46 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:03:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

18:03:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:03:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Various beacons killing off RATS."

18:04:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:04:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

18:04:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:04:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

18:04:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:04:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:04:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:04:11 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

18:04:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

18:04:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

18:04:13 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "There is nothing that will change the crushing reality that Outccord is a failure! STOP Outccord right now!"

18:04:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

18:04:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

18:04:16 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

18:04:18 Via general sector communication, AEU Battery-Powered Message Beacon transmits, "Supporting Outccord equals supporting the extinction of all of humanity. Make your choice carefully!"

18:04:19 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

18:04:22 There are no other ships in the sector.

18:04:45 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:04:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "About to salvage Bari corpses."

18:05:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well, I'd suggest keeping to probes and minors at the most."

18:05:17 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:05:17 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:05:21 There appear to be about 17 pilots recently active.

18:05:22 The communicator network detects:

18:05:22 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

18:05:22 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:05:32 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:05:34 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:05:34 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:05:36 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

18:05:37 You can go out and enter into the ship.

18:05:37 You exit the ship.

20:49:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So what's on the agenda?"

20:49:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Evangeline."

20:50:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hey. I ask because I saw a post by the GSL."

20:50:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm on Accord command trying to find something out."

20:50:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, well, I'm still recommending we don't undertake the missions."

20:50:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, cool. All right."

20:50:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "At least not until we know more. If we want to waste resources there are other ways."

20:51:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok, like... We really haven't been waisting any resources as it stands."

20:51:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We've been wasting some here and there."

20:51:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh?"

20:51:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Not that I'm necessarily advocating that, that was just the thrust of Lily's post I think."

20:51:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh. Ok."

20:53:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You're felo ok, Eva?"

20:53:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "So still sitting in Silver... Trying not to do work."

20:53:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know, it sucks."

20:53:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, I feed them every other day. It works."

20:53:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I so want to salvage right now or something. It is driving me nutty."

20:53:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But I'm not. I'm being strong... ish."

20:53:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I might salvage after the suit grind is done."

20:54:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Gotta get to the next upgrade level."

20:54:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You could do a load of salvage, then expel it all in the upper atmo of a gas giant."

20:54:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs. "Well I can understand why new pilots need to work."

20:54:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That way it's sort of like combo salvaging and scooping."

20:54:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh, that is so waistful."

20:54:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

20:54:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

20:54:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I miss scooping too. Don't even go there."

20:55:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

20:56:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I know. And now even when the strike ends, I still can't scoop."

20:56:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Since I blew up my transport and we can't buy scoops anymore."

20:56:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What? We can't buy scoops? Really?"

20:56:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Why did we strike? Where is that information?"

20:56:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I didn't even upgrade mine all the waaaaaay."

20:57:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, we can't buy stuff from Mutuality space."

20:57:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not ship related stuff, anyways."

20:57:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I thought we could if we were taken over there?"

20:57:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Good question, Kaiulani. Maybe we should make a board post about it."

20:57:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The short version is that our president wants to pull out of the Accord."

20:57:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "... Goddess above. Somewhere else better sell scoops then."

20:57:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I am trying to come up with a profile to graduate from cadetness, if that's how it's done."

20:57:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And a lot of us believe this will spell doom not just for the Union, but for humanity as a whole."

20:57:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, and we don't want him to. Or rather, we don't want to."

21:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"

21:00:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Aside from that, he kind of rules with a tight fist in general. He wants to kick foreigners out of Union space."

21:00:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Rediculous."

21:02:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He also doesn't believe that the Outsiders are a credible threat anymore, which is obviously a bit sticking point for a lot of pilots."

21:02:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Best must be stopped all together before he takes over completely and we never get our Union back."

21:02:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, in general, we believe the direction he's taking us in is dangerous."

21:02:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A blockade of New Earth?"

21:02:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think he really believes that either, about the Outsiders. I think tha'ts just propaganda to make unregs look even worse."

21:03:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So we have been preventing trade ships from reaching Union planets."

21:03:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It had some small effect reported in the news several weeks ago."

21:05:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He also wants to privatise the corps, probably so he can sell it to a relative just like did with those military contracts, though that was never proven."

21:05:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I feel like if privatizing is on the table we should be able to buy it ourselves."

21:05:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We're all billionaires, after all."

21:05:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course Best would never allow that."

21:06:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, or sell it to REvo or Hyperion Security."

21:06:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

21:11:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Stay safe."

21:11:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Launcher and Beacons are just out side, Eli, in the Requisitions."

21:13:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually Jonothon, could you give me a ride back to new Earth when you go."

21:13:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "I can. Where are you?"

21:13:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm on Accord command."

21:20:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually.. wait, can you give me a ride to Hyperion?"

21:20:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Yeah."

21:20:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "No problem."

21:45:01 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in fifteen Earth minutes!"

21:45:43 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

21:49:17 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:49:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, and an overstuffed dark green chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

21:49:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

21:50:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

21:57:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where else can a person find RATS?"

21:57:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Try poking around unclaimed sectors, and the beacons under them. Dusty reaches, spinward cluster."

21:58:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah, try C-12 as well."

21:58:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Just came from there, actually."

21:58:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs chuckles.

21:58:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "But if you see reapers, I'd suggest getting out. O?h, ok. Well, don't try there then."

21:58:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Chuckel."

21:58:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah ha! Found some!"

22:00:00 [General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau Quebec now departing at Space Station "Foxtrot"! All aboooooaaaaaaard!"

22:01:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kaiulani Greben transmits, "Wow EOS and AEU exchange rates are cool."

22:46:38 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:46:38 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location.

(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

22:46:40 Not much to see out there.

22:46:42 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:46:43 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:46:45 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:46:50 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

22:46:50 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

22:47:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:47:01 No recent FTL drive traces detected.

22:47:03 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:47:35 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?

22:47:37 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

22:47:42 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

22:47:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

22:47:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

22:47:57 You pull a large lever towards you.

22:47:58 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:00:53 Your communicator reports that...

23:00:54 
At least three recently active pilots are relaxing at Cicero's; Upper Dining Room.

23:16:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am looking for a RATS probe... will I need a salavging vessel to acquire it?"

23:16:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, anything with an electromagnetic matter manipulator."

23:17:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hrm. That's what I thought. What about the RATS attenna?"

23:17:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Antennas and such you get just from blowing up RATs. Your ship will automatically pull them in."

23:18:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Also what I wondered. Odd I haven't found one by now."

23:19:35 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yo."

23:21:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "A girl, not a gir, that would be silly."

23:21:32 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

23:21:47 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Well I guess you could smell like a girl if you are wearing some girly perfume or used some flowery soap."

23:22:10 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You do realize this is your fault, since you started sniffing everything? People used to pay less than no attention to what people smelled like."

23:22:23 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I smell like a cow and a bee had a baby."

23:22:48 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "So milk and honey."

23:23:03 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sounds girly to me."

23:23:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I dunno. I think that's one of those things that can go either way."

23:55:49 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The debris scanner."

23:57:10 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That only scans debris chunks. I am looking for a ver specific item, amoung loose debris."

23:57:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "What exactly are ya lookin for?"

23:59:00 [General Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "A RATS probe that has dropped off sensors, no power readings."

23:59:32 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. I think the anomaly detectors at SVP will help with that. And I'm thinkin they show up as "other object" not as debris. But it's been awhile."
