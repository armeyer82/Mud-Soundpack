-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Nouveau Quebec; Independence Plaza]
Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this
spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec. The straight
sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the
blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging
mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In
the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant
fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal
statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the
north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller,
somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au
Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique
des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window,
where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'
You see an automatic teller machine, a large bright blue trash bin, and a small

The bird danced, yellow and vivid against the painted walls,
The fountain tinkled, the water sparkled,
Cameras flashed, the children laughed,
You laughed about nothing, we spoke about nothing,
It always happens this way, every time,
But the stars continue forward in their orbits,
THe water continues to sing as it falls.

[Nouveau Quebec; Independence Plaza]
Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this
spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec. The straight
sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the
blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging
mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In
the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant
fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal
statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the
north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller,
somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au
Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique
des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window,
where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'
