-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at EAOS Asteroid Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a
letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a letter here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
power
You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.

(20 seconds roundtime.)
The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy
structure. The interior of your battlesuit cushions most of the turbulence.

thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.

giant bugs and mold!

while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins

amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

calves. He has rounded shoulders and a muscular chest. His face is oval and
quite handsome, with an average nose and strong chin. His lips are twisted and
brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of
plucked eyebrows, his eyes are blue and narrow. His mid-back length, straight
hair is carrot orange with dark blonde highlights and hanging in a thick, fluffy
mass over his shoulders. He has large pale fingernails.
 He is wearing a zebra stripe tricorn pirate hat, a soft orange and black
striped long-sleeved shirt with a buttoned-down collar, a fancy gold watch with
sapphire accents, a black leather belt with an oval black steel buckle, a pair
of old purple low rise jeans with shredded knees, and a pair of sleek white
vinyl boots with numerous silver zippers. He is also wearing a silver ring set
with a polished piece of dark gray lunar basalt, a bracelet of small amber
beads, a dark orange flat einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a mood
ring, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, an elegant gold box
chain necklace, a wrist-mounted chronometer, a stamp of a stylized leaping fox,

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (asleep)
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall
of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark blue tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies, a pair of tight white denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX'
embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of baby blue leather clogs with
a row of multicolored daisies across the toes. She is also wearing an orange and
white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny
tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer,
a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire
and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a
metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring
inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel
kitten on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', a
star print mandolin case, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria perched on her
shoulder. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left
uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

are getting back yet?"
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Purple all the way."
[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "They said a time between 3 to 8
days."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "And no, Ted, although if
someone wants to come approve a message I'll send them the news headline plus
ask them when they get back."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "When did they say that
though?"
[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Before they left."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The day they left."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Does anybody around have the
ability to do the roid station at 285? It's another day roughly I think it was
till it goes down, and I know I won't be around."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I can go part hunting for it,
sure. When does the beacon go down exactly?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I forget now, you're nearer
the range office."

don't have the time."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I don't have the time or the
information."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That'll take a good 12 hours or
so."
[General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Is it possible for me to help
doing things, I don't know much."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You just follow along the
beacon chain, you put up a beacon station and an accelerator with autonav, the
headings are 90 -1 and 270 1."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The chain has to have all the
accelerators done right and I don't know the headings or anything."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Those are the headings."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I asked Melinda about it last
time."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "270 is more complicated
apparently, and 776 is changing when they get back too."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The big thing is that you have
to get to 274 by 8 hours from now, otherwise the only way to find it is either
with a charter or pure luck."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "270 is more complicated as far
as I know cause they accidentally fucked it up when building."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Let it fall, and let Eve and
Mel work it out when they get back, because I know Eve is changing 776 too."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "285 is probably more
important, because people might want to use it tomorrow, I'm just not one of
them."
