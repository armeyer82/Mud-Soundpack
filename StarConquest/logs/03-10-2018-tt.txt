-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a greater minimodule of damage capacity and projectile boost, a greater
minimodule of projectile boost and projectile resistance, and a large white and

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good afternoon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Kim."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "While I personally
don't mind the government's choice to reject an invitation to give one of our
pilots temporarily to the EAOS, if the rest of you think differently, let me
know, and I can send a message to the liaison office on your behalf to see what
they'd say about picking one of you for the post."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Though the EAOS does
have final say on the candidate regardless if it is how it was last time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I frankly am
disheartened that we're not represented. That's just my own humble opinion."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "When was the last
time people were temporarily inducted into the EAOS and what was the reason for
inviting people then?"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person
medium transport "Money Maker". The organization has earned 1,875,541.64
credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And yes, I am too
disappointed that 1, we are not represented, and 2 that our government
apparently deamed it unimportant for one of us to be represented, and even
unimportant to ask us what we think about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Precisely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It was several years
ago, and the primary purpose was to test out things like the rift drive, more
than anything else to be honest. They sent us to scout out places like the Radio
Bubble and the Glyphmakers Grave before making the technology available to other
pilots and then making the locations known to the other pilots as well. Odds are
that they probably will have something similar for the new detachment to test."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well I personally would
love such a challenge. They would likely not choose me but it would be a great
opportunity for one of us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, we are already
getting very much isolated, if this continues and our government keeps this up,
soon the AEU will count for nothing. Certanly not the AEU pilot corps. I don't
think we should just accept that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The person who's
chosen will have to work well with the other alliances, for sure. Since you'll
be working with members of each at any given time. The person who's chosen will
also have to be reasonably active, I'd wager."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I personally have
never had any problem working with anyone, with the rare exception here and
there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But you're also not
very active, generally."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well when it involves
work, one must be professional and put their personal differences aside."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not saying I
definitely want to do this. But we are totally passed by and that does annoy
me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "1 Yes, it's though our
government doesn't regard any of us as being able to contribute or to have any
talent."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll forward your
concerns to the liaison office, and leave it to them to pass to the government,
who will make their final decision about whether or not they choose to agree to
send a pilot that the EAOS will then select."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Alright, I have sent
a message."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Of course, Shule and
Constantine and any other active pilot have not had a say about this either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well the message has
been conveyed so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, the worst thing
that can happen is that they just say no, right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Which they probably
will, in all honesty."
[AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl
Orbit is now online!
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise whistles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Scoop scoop away!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, I just brought
a new Starseekers scoop online, while I was not doing anything else majorly
important. I think I will do something industrial next."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "After all,
Starseekers is really only uh, like 800 points away from a better salvage
processor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Speaking of modules,
I put some more in Seas's warehouse."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes, I noticed that and
thanks. I think keeping the Salvage, BAS and Asteroid stations is worthwhile. We
don't have sufficient activity to totally make me happy but in time, we'll be
able to encourage our pilots to use these stations. Also I'm not too concerned
about the expense at this time since we earn more than enough form our scoop to
cover those and then some."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Same here, and I have
plenty of credits to convert to megacredits, so there isn't any real problem
there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also though, anytime
either of you want the Xenology station to go back up, just say."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is probably a good
idea we wait until we either run some sort of artifacting trip, or until several
new pilots are actually out there artifacting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Exactly, that's my
thought too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or if we can get across
to GM G and make a group effort to do so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well, if plenty
of us have been to GMG and we want to cash the artifacts from there, that would
be worth it too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I suppose I need to
go haul some roids this week, because so far we've only made 5 mil from there,
this term?"
[Tactical Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "We need one person who has
several hours that will want to go on these turtle missions. Probably kind of
low GCP people need not apply."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I can run you all
across to the glyphmakers for a prolonged period of time if that is desired.
However, with the Fringe willing to work with us, which many of them have shown
they are, why not ask to go with one of them, or even some of the League pilots
who are still willing to work with us? That won't only show that you all want to
go out and do things again, but it will show that you all are willing to go out
and do things with people other than members of the AEU."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup. I don't earn
anything from artifacts from GMG anymore but I'd love to go back out and it
would be a good opportunity. I'd imagine we'd put a recharge station up out
there and stay a few days to make it wort while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, how can you take
us to GMG when none of us can go? Just curious? And I do agree, working with
pilots from other alliances should stay important."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Actually we are willing
to work with others but have already been shunned form other activities when I
volunteered overc tactactal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "First of all you're
incorrect. We can go to glyphmakers if we want to. We can't use the skims, there
is a difference."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Ah, so you know the
way there without the skims, right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "It was League who did
that so I wasnt shocked heh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think yesterday
Johann took Constantine on beacons, but not sure that means he's always willing
to take us, or whether he really was just very desperate to get a cruiser beacon
going."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yewh well I belive
Johann would be the exception."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Johann works with us
all the time. He's helped me cleanse old frontier before."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "As well as Katina."

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as

 You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a stormy pair of trousers, and
a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white
cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved
with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone
holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a
metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red
shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping
xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse,
a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your

[Starship "Defensive Dissidence"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A wide transparisteel viewport provides a large field of view out
the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for
the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the
viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the
shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up
and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably
stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged
around it. Everything is within fast and easy reach, with the weapon controls in
particular close to hand. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green
status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock
Alpha.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
wormhole drive tracer, and an improved temporary wormhole drive here.
