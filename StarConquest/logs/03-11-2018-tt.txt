Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Gamma.

Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with

The There's a meeting at 2230 tomorrow. Station participation is being
discussed. I doubt that I can make it but Melinda said she would communicate
with us regarding their decision. I indicated that we would be willing to share
in the cost of the Accelerator to 285 to support our Asteroid Processor. Heh I
guess the cost of the nice power plants which SEAS and Starseekers is hurting
their big fat organization coffers."

concerning maintaining balances of credits and Megacredits. I just prefer that
we have enough to support our contributions and a couple of months in reserves.
Having said that, we have much more than we need and so unless we're just
throwing resources at the wind, I don't believe in hoarding resources."

few of us present. I just wanted to let you all know that I spoke with Melinda
today. There will be a meeting tomorrow at 2230 to discuss our participation
with Temporary Space stations. Initially she asked me about our involvement with
the 285 Asteroid processor. She asked if we were willing to share in the e
expense of the Accelerator. I said we would be willing to. Then she asked if we
had plans to build Salvage or BAS stations in the typical sectors. I responded
no that we only planned to place ours around Steel phoenix Command. Then she
mentioned our participation in future stations. I indicated that we would be
willing to work with them again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All acceptible
answers!"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good, I'm glad you
approve. We'll see how it goes. Unfortunately, I likely won't be able to attend.
I asked her to reach ut to me, you Ather or Kim if other input was necessary. I
certainly didn't initiate this breech so I know that we were still willing to be
a team player."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I will definitely do
my best to be present for that meeting. And I have never had a problem working
with them and certainly won't have now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "She assured me that we
wouldn't be attacked. I am hopefully this didn't just imply physically but that
they would conduct themselves professionally."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think their
decision not to work with us has rather done the opposite of what I think they
intended with it. We've had to build our own salvage and BAS stations and surely
our government would appreciate that more than seeing us cooperate with the
other alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That's a good point
that you could in theory mention at tomorrow's meeting. I wasn't invited, so I
won't be going, but invaders will do whatever. We still have a shitton of parts
for the usual collections of stations."

invited either."

been invited until this point."

the impression that we weren't invited. Since I typically have takent he lead on
station participation, that's why she reached out to me."

sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, if you can't
make it, send a letter to either Kim or mee so we can go in your place or
something. Preferably Kim if she's going to be around. A lot of these people are
fucking nutcases that I'd rather not be cooped up with for a prolonged fucking
period."

bad? Who are the worst nut cases I need to keep an eye out for?"

anyone else, to be honest. Johann isn't horrible, Melinda's OK, I don't know who
else is going to be present."

really can generally work pretty ok with everyone, so I will definitely make an
effort to be there."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.
Via general sector communication, Old Frontier Processor transmits, "Hello
there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person
cargo hauler "Long Haul". The organization has earned 489,444.00 credits.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking
bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an
individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly
seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and
hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very
well built and maintained station.

voicemail, yeah they do, the others are not so bad, like message board, news
reader, that sort of stuff."
Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "For reference I
think I have full service with message board and news and it's 25 million a
month."
tr 1 I started out with the basics for a few months until I could afford
everything else.

doubles it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hey Alistair, how
many industry points do you actually have?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have everything and
it costs 67 mil per month."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "111."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "So when I start up
should I go outgoing? Local or full service?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Wow, and you are
still flying a cargo hauler? I think, unless something has changed, you could
get a light transport by now?"
tr 1 I vote full service plan
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I vote full service
plan."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "If you can afford it,
full service."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "But yes I just started
out with basics initially until I could earn more income as it's not productive
to work just to support owning a phone. In fact, I didn't have a phone or
apartment or those kinds of fringe benefits for a couple of months."
Constantine Stone speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would go with
full, that alone shouldn't be too costly."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I did get a phone
fairly quickly, but at first it just had the full service plan and nothing else.
I was able to live with another pilot at first so that definitely made life
easier on me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I have plans to get
a light transport, I treat myself to a limo so I could do some taxi'ing."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Did we figure
out what's required for the mission? I wonder if it's space combat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Huh I can just hear the
going back and forth on their channels. I doubt she will engage us but at least
we're willing to play."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, well, if she
ignores our offers and then has not enough crew, it's not our fault is it?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Nope not at all!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much space
combat do you have, Kim?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "3502 space combat
points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh wow, okay."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I have 9622."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe you can
check if you're able to get the mission some time, Alistair."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you can get
it I can stop worrying about raising my space combat for it."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just be careful
not to accept it if you try."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I should think all you
need is the minimum to qualify for the tier 1."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "How much space combat
do you have, Constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I don't
know. When the Fringe joined the Steel Phoenix and some of them couldn't do it,
I got hopeful that maybe I couldn't because my space combat was too low."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But it's
probably just that I can't do it at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "1561."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I stopped
working on it after I got enough for a cruiser, basically."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Which mission is
this?"
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been
received at AEU Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the
two-person hardened asteroid hauler "The Zilant". The organization has earned
130,776.85 credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Shouldn't because we
need to keep our skills up to par for defending humanity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "The mission to get
the turtle suit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's an
officer at steel phoenix command that offers a special mission that gives you
access to a unique battlesuit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my
skills are fine, at least for doing beacons."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can do them in
my sleep."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Oh right, I still
need to do some ground combat, at some point anyway."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes but a willingness
to perform is also in favor I should think so that is why we should continue to
engage wheever necessary and possible. I have way more than I need but I just
like to show a cooperative spirit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I think I
do do what is necessary."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I might
have a different idea about what is necessary, though. Do I need to do 8 beacons
per conquest? Probably not really, and I don't. Would I defend space whenever it
gets attacked? Of course I would."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Alistair how much
ground combat do you have so far? I think the minimum on that suit may be 300."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I don't need
5000 space combat points to do that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't even
need 1600 space combat points to do that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, my ground
combat skills are not the strongest, but I have always made an effort to keep
them adequate."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "I need a suit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, for ground
combat a suit is a minimal requirement."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "And I agree, you
don't need to do 8 beacons each conquest. It's been rare occasions where I
actually managed to do that many."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I did it back
when I thought I needed the points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Alistair there are some
to get started with on Space Vermin Patrol and you need to do those as they
won't be available indefinitely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But surprise,
there's really nothing you need that many points for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "At least not
right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm sure our
pseudo-alliance with the fringe will produce some tech I also don't need."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Which suit would
you start with?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well if you can get a
rental but I started out with our own suit, the aEU because you can repair
yourself. It isn't good on armor but it's going to keep you alive if you are
careful enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Ok, I'll add it to
my todo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I used the
AEU suit all the way through low deployments until I couldn't do them anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Are careful enough that
is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's perfectly
fine to use instead of the rental."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Rental might be
better if you want to get up to doing tesla by yourself."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Luckily they
allow everyone two suit slots now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So you can
always pick up both."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So did I and only
exploded once!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Also, there's a
fund for new pilots to draw on for suit-related stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "May as well use
it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, the AEU suit is
not a bad suit, if you just watch your damage, and the low deployments are a bit
challenging, but the space vermin patrol missions are really good."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah because after you
achieve a certain number of points, you won't be able to do Space Vermin
missions anymore."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Ok what is this
fund?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you go to the
fund center at the new phoenix space port you can access it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think 400 ground
combat, so that is a nice little while yet, where deployments on New Earth stop
at 250."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Will do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't empty it,
obviously, but there's plenty enough in there to get yourself set up with a
basic suit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Also, learning Tesla is
another way to earn a fair amount of credits and points and it isn't going to
draw enemy until you have 250 Ground."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, she has not
directly said no."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It would be a
lot easier if she would."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You could just
show up and see what happens."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That is what I plan
to do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I just need to go
back a while, got quite a few sectors out salvaging."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "She didn't seem like
she was saying no, at least."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yup she's basically
just stonewalling but oh well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think that whole
stance they took in hopes of accomplishing something is softening with a
majority of them to be honest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That would be about
time too, if you ask me."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I just showed up on
tesla one day merely to do missions and Earrache I mean what's his name slapped
me. I wasn't even going to ask to participate in whatever their mission was and
I didn't want to in the first place as was my first time to try out the Monk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "I didn't say a word...
just selected my work and moved on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, he just
slapped you?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh sorry poked me guess
that was the wrong word but he behaved as such."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Constantine, how
much would you withdraw?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I can't
remember what the tier 1 suit costs. I would think 10 or 12 should be plenty to
cover the suit and the modules and abilities you can get to start."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can always
get some then get more later if it was too expensive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Alistair Krumb transmits, "Ok thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hmm, they either
already left, or their mission is stalling because they don't have enough
people."

Star Conquest Help: Megapod Raids
--
Category: Activities
--
The 'megapod' is a massive Bari infestation (see the Bari help file) of the EAOS
Experimental Research Structure, which was abandoned during the Outsider War. An
IFS attack several years later catastrophically breached the structure, allowing
the Bari access to space. Given the EAOS's penchant for tinkering and genetic
engineering, the full extent of the infestation and the nature of the creatures
inhabiting the megapod is unknown.
However, you and your fellow civilian pilots can help to uncover the mysteries
of the megapod. Through a series of scouting missions, assaults, and raids, you
can penetrate ever deeper into the megapod and, with a little luck, even recover
some pre-War EAOS technology. To participate, deploy an aerial fortress to the
Experimental Research Structure.
Here are the available megapod missions, ordered by difficulty. Missions are not
all linear, and sometimes your party will have a choice of where to go. Greater
danger often brings greater rewards! One megapod mission may be completed for
full loot and credit per Conquest period. You may also do additional raids per
Conquest period at your current level or lower, perhaps to help others, but they
will credit you and the mission will not generate a loot item for you.
SCOUT THE MEGAPOD
A scouting mission ventures just a short distance into one of the megapod's many
exterior entrances. By exploring these top level tunnels, you can find ways to
move deeper into the megapod.
Recommended Party Size: 5
SHALLOW ASSAULT
Move beyond the entry area of the megapod and see what is brewing just below the
surface.
Requirements: Five scouting missions completed by every would-be participant.
Recommended Party Size: 5
DEEP ASSAULT
Move much deeper into the megapod and into more well-developed and dangerous
nests of Bari.
Requirements: Five shallow assault missions completed by every would-be
participant.
Recommended Party Size: 5
More missions will come in the future!

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
There appear to be some people in the lounge.
