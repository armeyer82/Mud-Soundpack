00:16:21 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "The booklet says so."

00:16:26 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "The 285 accelleration? I don't know. I have not been around in a few days though I can ask."

00:16:37 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Not sure if it is updated."

00:16:39 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright. I'll see what I can do."

00:16:48 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I just go in and buy the stupid parts to go on their mod transports."

00:24:38 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Checking."

00:26:48 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Seems so, processor is still up."

00:26:58 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright, I'll check on it."

00:27:33 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "But its my first time doing this so I may be wrong."

00:27:34 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

00:27:54 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "I'll look. If seekers is supposed to get the 285 accelerator then we are."

00:38:19 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Sorry, Eva, the 287 that is going down in 8 hours is the recharger."

00:38:35 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:42:01 [Tactical Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Oh."

00:43:34 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

00:44:34 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

00:45:12 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 369,250.44 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

01:42:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Ok."

01:43:14 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:43:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.

A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

13:50:02 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

13:50:20 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

13:53:56 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras laughs.

13:55:02 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

13:58:02 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

13:58:03 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Laughs and say oh, I know. But this was particularly barmy."

13:58:32 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire chuckles. "We all have our moments."

13:59:28 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras chuckles.

14:00:15 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well, I thought it'd reached tesla, failed to see I hadn't, failed to see I was interdicted, failed to notice that those ships with the funny names were pirates. By the time I had noticed, I was almost docked with the first pirate ship, and so got blasted to hell when I went to go try and get to the interdictors."

14:29:57 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm not a Trustee."

14:30:02 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps down from your lap.

14:30:03 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Damm, OK."

14:30:09 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ted asked me earlier."

14:30:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Did you do the headings?"

14:30:22 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yes."

14:31:02 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well, no one's ever complained about free trips."

14:31:02 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

14:31:22 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Doesn't seem to be working."

14:31:25 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I also didn't point that fact out."
