00:41:27 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:41:27 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Shule:

You say yourself that you did not respond on tactical when Cheri, a member of the alliance that was being sieged, called for help. This is a matter of courtesy. Pilots keep each other informed when responding to invasions. To not try to join the crew that was already forming and to instead jump in unannounced shows that there is no spirit of cooperation there. It's also courteous for other alliances to keep the alliance under attack informed over tactical when they intend to respond. Especially when the responding ship has no diplomatic relations with the owner of the space it's entering.

Morris tells me that the response he gave to your ship was "We got it." No doubt he was terse, but this is a good example of keeping another pilot informed about the status of things. It was not a demand that you leave. Again there is a lack of courtesy on both sides here. Silently refusing to join the crew already forming and taking your own ship instead doesn't make it look like we're working together, so maybe a terse reply when you jump in unannounced is understandable.

As I said recently about a completely different incident, if you and Lily want to change the impressions people have about you, making a more honest effort to work with others would be step one. And yes, I have also spoken to Morris about how he could do better too.

As for the hit you took, let me put my SDC hat on for a minute here. I was on that ship
01:22:02 , and Morris said several times to watch our fire and not take potshots since there were multiple friendly ships around. It is possible for a ship to track the wrong target and for the gunners to fire at it, but several things need to go wrong for that to happen. What happens instead, 99 times out of 100, is that the enemy target evades and a friendly ship flies into their coordinates just in time to take the hit. In other words friendly fire usually results from the actions of the victim and is actually unavoidable on the part of the ship that did the shooting. But nobody can keep track of every enemy ship's position and so it ends up being nobody's fault. This sort of friendly fire is very very common and to try to make it out to be a deliberate act is very disingenuous.

Which brings me to the last part of your letter. The League doesn't respond well to threats and I hope you had the backing of your Voice when you made them. If you want to try to turn this personal feud into an interalliance incident, that will be on you. Personally I think the AEU has already isolated itself enough, but I know you and Lily will do what you feel is best.

01:35:00 Please define extremely uncooperative behavior. The only station we put up during the strike was the Beacon in 777. I accomodated Morris when you asked me not to include him because he pressured me. So please provide me a detailed explanation and list of how we've been uncooperative to support your justifications. Otherwise, SEAS will certainly be maintaining their own income-producing stations. So if you don't like the competition, which won't be that great, then please cooperate with us in return. I look forward to your detailed report. - Lily Kaise

01:38:22 You nod.

01:38:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I really want to know how we've been uncooperative other than the beacon in 777."

01:38:50 You say, "YEah, I have no idea."

01:40:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So Emily Ford sent me a rude letter with a felo trough."

01:40:29 You ask, "What? Why?"

01:40:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Why does ford do anything."

01:40:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Just to be the drama queen she is."

01:40:56 You nod.

01:42:19 Minor Change: People should now be able to properly take on two AEU ground patrols per day.

01:42:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ford's letter said - Keeping your head in this will stop all the lies and drama from being perpetuated."

01:42:53 You say, "Wow."

01:43:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I wrote back and said 'no you keep your head in it drama queen and the last laugh is on me!"

01:43:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

01:43:17 You chuckle.

01:43:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have no idea what she means by lies as I have not lied about anything."

01:43:49 You say, "Yeah, me neither."

01:44:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I keep letters and I will show anyone the letters I have."

01:44:33 You nod.

01:46:45 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ford probably wrote back but I will not go back and forth."

01:47:00 You say, "Nah, she's seriously not worht your time and energy."

01:47:03 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'll get the mail so I don't keep being bothered and trash it."

01:47:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Be right back but she so wants an exchange but it ended with my last response."

01:47:44 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

01:47:46 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:05:41 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:05:42 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

02:05:46 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:05:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident frowns.

02:05:53 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:05:57 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow Nissi has bought into the bullshit."

02:06:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:06:18 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts down a letter.

02:06:22 --

02:06:23 Lily:

This letter is an example of uncooperative behavior. So is the example you named. So are the issues Morris and Evenia and Melinda have communicated to me which I'm sure you're familiar with. But here's what it comes down to.

I don't report to you. No one except the people in your own org need to report to you. We're supposed to be in this together. This attitude you guys are stewing in has to change or you will continue to find yourselves isolated. Get out of the bubble you're in, talk to people, and clear the air. Otherwise nothing is going to change and I'll just wish you good luck with your solo endeavors.

02:06:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So she is twisting our wanting to survive into being uncooperative."

02:06:51 You say, "Yeah, that's what it looks like."

02:07:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:07:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident examines a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

02:07:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident makes a selection on a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of white paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into her waiting hand.

02:07:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:07:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives you a sheet of white paper.

02:07:49 --
Nissi, I believe the converse is quite the case here. I wouldn't back up my starship and offload modules which were provided to cooperatively work together on a project without first notifying the affected party that I wanted to end our business arrangements. I would also show common courtessy to a party who wrote to me asking me why I had engaged in a certain action and respond to them. It may be uncomfortable but here is a situation where Evenia chose to take matters into her own hands. I had written to Evenia and to Johann and neither responded. I also wrote to Melinda who didn't respond. This was before I had any idea that Ather had asked that we be removed from station participation. I think it's you all who want to exist in your own bubble as we're certainly willing to deal. When I went to put up the beacon in 777, I had no idea that the protest was going forward. I also had about an hour to be available and then a little time later on and I was caught between Johann being demanding and what Eli wanted to do. As I have stated, I thought this was going to occur the day before when I was here at work. The rest of that week, I wasn't able to come into work until the weekend and Eli was finished with this phase. So it's nothing to do with deliberately wanting to be uncooperative. I simply could not be in two places at once nor please everyone at once. I did more than the majority of AEU pilots during the strike. I have mor

02:07:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is what I wrote to her."

02:07:58 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Anyone up for beacons?"

02:08:49 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:08:52 [Tactical Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "I can engineer."

02:08:56 To whom/what do you want to give it?

02:08:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't need that."

02:09:06 To whom/what do you want to give it?

02:09:09 You say, "Ah, ok."

02:09:14 You put a sheet of white paper in a leather briefcase.

02:09:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But you see, they didn't give us any opportunity to do anything."

02:09:32 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I can shoot with much mediocrity."

02:09:37 You nod.

02:09:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They did what they wanted to just as I predicted."

02:09:41 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Two more?"

02:10:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So our response is only for our own survival and out of self-defense. They want us to sit back and do nothing and that's not how it works boys and girls."

02:10:35 You nod.

02:11:02 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "We can take the phanta, if you two want."

02:11:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:11:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You see, had it been them and I truly felt firm, I wouldn't be so mean-spirited. I would just say waht she said at the end but I would understand that they had to do what they have to do in respect to us of course."

02:11:31 You nod.

02:11:59 [Tactical Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Ehhh..."

02:12:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If they would have offered a period of time or anything, then I would certainly work with them to the best I could but now they are the ones creating the friciton."

02:12:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Friction."

02:12:18 [Tactical Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Sure."

02:12:30 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Tanny, you up to it?"

02:12:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was actually going to not do anything for a week."

02:12:43 You say, "YEah, it seems like they didn't give us much time to respond."

02:12:53 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Does that mean I'll be the only one shooting?"

02:12:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So tinight or tomorrow, up goes a bAS."

02:13:05 You nod.

02:13:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And perhaps a Xenology station."

02:13:18 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yes, Tanny."

02:13:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then a Salvage processor somewhere."

02:13:45 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "We can try it. I'm still not a great shot though."

02:13:55 You nod.

02:13:57 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Chetumal, please."

02:16:58 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:17:01 You squeeze Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident affectionately.

02:18:09 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:19:43 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

02:19:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So our scoop will go down in about 7 hours. If I wake up around that time, I'll put it up but if you wake up before I do and don't notice it on the Station Reference, would you mind deploying it Love?"

02:20:09 You say, "No problem."

02:20:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You don't have to deploy it then I'm just saying whomever wakes up the earliest."

02:20:33 You nod and smile.

02:20:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

02:20:43 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:21:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I have to admit I'm disappointed but you see as I said they are the ones who want to isolate themselves from the aEU."

02:21:18 You say, "Yeah, me too."

02:21:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "People are just pigs."

02:21:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And who are the lyers."

02:21:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:21:41 You say, "They sure can be."

02:21:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "People like EEvania are the biggest ones."

02:21:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Evenia."

02:22:13 You say, "She'll kiss whoever's butt she needs to or wants to."

02:22:20 You say, "Sorry."

02:22:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "The irony is they talked about Evenia big time on that trip. They said she had her own little clique around her and how she would play both sides. So what are they doing now?"

02:23:05 You nod.

02:23:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They also talked about Johann and oh Nissi had a lot to say about Johann."

02:23:36 You say, "Well, she'll burn people eventually. Evenia that is."

02:23:38 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nissi said how he does things Johann's way."

02:23:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He does to a point but we always got along with him before."

02:23:59 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:25:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh yeah well, if the Artifacting trip doesn't happen soon, I do plan to call Evenia and Johann and I'm sorry love but things are going to come to a head and you have to tell Evenia how uncomfortable you were over what she did. I will obviously tell her that I considered it cheap and that it was coming onto you and that I did discount it but after what she did to sEAS, this was the last straw. I'm sorry but Johann has to know about at least one of her stunts."

02:26:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He told me I couldn't call her permiscuous."

02:26:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well if that wasn't permiscuous, then I don't know what it is."

02:27:08 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Also I don't think I should do the speaking for you becasue I'd be accused of that."

02:28:16 Shule sighs and frowning, says, "I really don't want to do that. I just feel it's going to make things worse for us and the org."

02:29:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok if nissi wrote back, again I won't go back and forth. I won't beg and I refuse to keep it going."

02:29:59 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glides out.

02:30:03 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:39:41 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:39:43 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident just entered the ship.

02:39:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh interesting."

02:39:56 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Maybe the light went on there."

02:40:06 You ask, "What?"

02:40:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:40:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts down a letter.

02:40:47 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

02:41:05 You say, "Ah, ok."

02:41:08 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

02:41:48 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.

02:41:52 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I told her I would be available tomorrow after midnight, Thursday after 2200 and a good portion of Saturday. If you can be on hand and if Constantine will be available, that would be great."

02:42:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I also said we won't be setting up any income-producing stations until we have met."

02:43:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then if they won't deal, then, I think we've done our fair share."

02:43:08 You say, "I'll try my best to be available."

02:43:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok and I understand."

02:43:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just would rather not be the sole witness."

02:43:31 You nod.

02:43:53 You say, "I understand."

02:44:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because I'm concerned about their ganging up on me too."

02:44:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's shoulder.

02:44:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So please let me know which time you would be most comfortable with and please try to commit."

02:45:56 You nod.

02:46:37 You say, "Well, the times you mentioned are probably best for me anyways."

02:46:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "You sure?"

02:46:58 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because I really don't want to go alone."

02:47:05 --

If you want to deal, let's set up a time to meet about it. I'll bring Melinda and you bring Shule or whoever. Going back and forth over mail isn't very practical.

02:47:52 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "So anyone else for beacons?"

02:48:04 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Sure. When, and where?"

02:48:19 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yes, those should work barring anything unexpected."

02:48:25 [Tactical Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Chetumal, please."

02:48:37 [Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I can make that happen."

02:48:42 [Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm game."

02:49:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok Love. I'll also invite Constantine as I would like for him first to be kept in the loop and second, he can see firsthand what kind of bullshit these individuals are capable of."

02:49:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs helplessly.

02:49:23 You nod.

02:49:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They so, especially Melinda, so loves to play both sides and blame the person who she has tried to manipulate."

02:50:05 You nod.

02:50:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I got caughtin the middle. Had I refused to put one of Morris's modules on the station, he would have yelled."

02:50:48 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And I'd still be the bad apple."

02:50:52 You say, "Of course he would have."

02:51:10 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Melinda would have sided with him and said how mean and uncooperative I was."

02:52:31 You say, "More thanlikely."

02:55:17 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

02:55:23 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cuddles up to you.

02:56:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident helps herself to a slice of pinwheel pizza.

02:56:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident dangles a day old slice of pinwheel pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

02:56:40 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ugh ok."

02:56:51 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Perhaps she's offering a meeting time."

03:11:07 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident examines a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser for a moment.

03:11:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident makes a selection on a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser, and a sheet of green paper slides out of the slot at the bottom into her waiting hand.

03:11:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a sparkly purple plastic paper dispenser in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

03:12:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident gives you a sheet of green paper.

03:12:50 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sits down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

03:13:11 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sorry I meant tomorrow or Friday."

03:13:57 --

03:13:57 Hi Constantine, tomorrow, Thursday after midnight or on Friday after Midnight, we're going to meet with Nissi Valdaire and Melinda Michaels to make an attempt to come to some consensus concerning our being allowed to participate on Temporary Space Stations. As you read on that rant of Melinda's on General, she claims we've been uncooperative. Yet, so far, we've had nothing to be uncooperative about! So this is to try to clear the air. This also may have to do with the conflict between shule and Morris but Morris is clearly in the wrong here and he has no basis to dictate to others who arrive to provide assistance. We were the first to show in Chet's Grill and as you know, in the other sector, his ship fired on Shules. Also, someone fired on our Navy from Eli's Pulsar while in B-19 the other morning as well. Morris's nasy behavior was unwarranted as all that I said was 'please watch your fire'. At any rate, you know how I am. I will not beg anyone but I am reasonable and if anyone presents a reasonable offer, I will generally accept it. I also told Nissi that until we met, that we would not establish any income-producing stations. Personally, I do not hold out a lot of hope that they will deal. However, at least they cannot claim that we are as uncooperative as they would like to think. - Lily

03:19:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Morris is going to make a big deal out of why we didn't show up when he wanted to take a cruiser. Well, he was calling for three and I certainly wasn't clear if he wanted to go undercrewed both times. We did show though and the hammerhead had already launched."

03:20:06 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I know that is why you didn't volunteer us He is the one who should have said."

03:22:06 You say, "Well, Nissi did respond to my letter and did say that she spoke to Morris about how he could have handled it better. She did point out that neither of us handled it very well."

11:21:54 Flight control gives the ship launch clearance.

11:21:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

11:22:01 The ship is already moving.

11:22:04 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

11:22:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

11:22:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

11:22:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

11:22:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

11:22:13 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

11:22:14 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

11:22:14 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

11:28:23 You see nothing special.

11:28:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small white dragonflies and a pair of blue stonewashed denim jeans with a small dark red 'XX' embroidered on the left front pocket. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitte
11:28:35 n on the side, a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria', and a star print mandolin case. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a letter, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers here.

20:24:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not bad. Yourself?"

20:24:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Bad dreams man, bad dreams... But I'm otherwise alright."

20:25:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Want to do something?"

20:26:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not sleeping well.. I think I might actually doze a bit longer."

20:26:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Eli, will you and Stone be doing the Security missions?"

20:27:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm still not, no. I just can't bring myself to clomp around my homeworld in a war machine."

20:27:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Understandable."

20:30:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Surprised the withdrawl hasn't finished already."

20:30:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What, withdrawal?"

20:30:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

20:31:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The withdrawl from the Accord of Free Worlds."

20:31:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's what all the striking and the protesting was about."

20:31:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was thinking. Because the strike is over.. we can still protest."

20:32:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can, but I can't. That was part of my agreement."

20:32:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The agreement only pertains to me though, not sure if constantine's was exactly the same or not."

20:33:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm still allowed to have my opinion of course, as the liaison stated, this is not the Fringe."

20:33:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Unless Best comes forward with a plan of action, that is thoroughly detailed, and explaining in detail his reasons for leaving the Accord. I'll protest it."

20:33:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been listening, just doing some other stuff."

20:34:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was told I couldn't call for strikes or violent demonstrations."

20:34:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ms Richard said nothing to me that led me to believe I couldn't peacefully protest."

20:34:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure I could likely join one, but I can't start one. She told me I had to cease any calls to actions, especially violent ones."

20:35:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Effigies are neither violent demonstrations or strikes. It's just a..... form of protest."

20:36:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Actually, I think Effigies are a form of peacefull protesting."

20:38:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.

20:41:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Anyways... I just realised that the Flitter has more Grid, then the Fighters.."

20:43:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't know that."

20:43:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much more?"

20:43:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I really should behave myself, if I ever hope to become a full pilot."

20:43:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "About 100."

20:44:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The fighter has 350.. and the flitter has 450."

20:44:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking earlier today that there might have been other ways to show them that we needed the Accord."

20:44:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It would have been great if we could have arranged ride-alongs of some kind."

20:44:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "With liaison officers."

20:44:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe we still can."

20:44:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though the withdrawal will likely be completed in the next three days."

20:44:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Still can. It's neither striking, nor violent protests."

20:45:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, pleading for them to reconsider."

20:45:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There just might not be time enough for the information to get up the chain to Rebane quickly enough. Still, it might be worth showing the government the value of the Accord, even after we've left."

20:45:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The accord should just outright refuse the withdrawl."

20:45:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Can't hurt to ry, but I doubt that anyone will come. Pleading to reconsider privately was how this whole ting got started and they not only ignored it, but released a headline that said we agreed with it."

20:46:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This whole ting has been an escalation. It started off very official."

20:46:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it seems so long ago that Mr. Lambeth told us the first step should be a non-binding resolution."

20:46:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am sure it will become self evident after the AEU leaves the Accord."

20:46:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder what the second step was supposed to be."

20:46:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No idea."

20:47:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I almost forget that you were there for that first meeting Constantine."

20:47:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "When accord vessels don't come to our sectors to assist fighting off Alien threats.."

20:48:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We all expected the government to just tell us that the opinion was appreciated but they were moving forward anyways, but we didn't even get that much.. then I ended up releasing the minutes of the meeting to the press, and we've just escalted over and over from there."

20:48:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh brother."

20:49:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, and it lead to what we did the other day. I was being pressured by many poeple to do something else, being pulled in nearly every direction. The pressure and the shortness of time made me not think clearly. I really should have known better that it would happen that way."

20:49:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I really would like an idea what they have in mind, when AEU is no longer apart of the Accord. If they even have the smallest of plans... they should fill us in. If they don't, than that is just stupid."

20:50:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We both should have known better. But you're right, there was a constant pressure on you to come up with more and better solutions."

20:50:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Should've just burned an effigy."

20:50:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I don't blame you for it."

20:51:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And honestly, from the way First Speaker Shea puts it, it will be good for the Union for a time. It will probably seem really good at first, like we never should have even protested it. But in the end it's going to be bad for all the alliances."

20:51:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes, it is."

20:51:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I mean with what they have planned I won't be surprised if the economy booms."

20:51:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But credits aren't going to buy us safety."

20:51:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not in the long run."

20:51:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Time to train more pilots.."

20:52:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Because -we're- going to need them."

20:52:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sigh and we still have to worry about privatisation too. Hopefully it won't be so bad."

20:52:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

20:52:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, guys, I'm shipping out."

20:52:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ather, of course, would say i'm being delusional."

20:53:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be back around in 10 days or two weeks or so."

20:53:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, we're gonna miss you Constantine, you better come back damnit."

20:53:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good luck with everything."

20:53:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Privatisation isn't a bad thing... Unless we can know what /we/ are doing.. and how that is suppossed to workk."

20:53:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be back."

20:53:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Make notes at the meeting I'm sure you guys will have while I'm gone."

20:53:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I mean, if we have to pay for our own ships... then we better be paid full for all our work."

20:53:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I will Constantine, I'll be sure to kep you informed. You might even just have a bunch of mail when you come back."

20:54:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be nice, stuff to read."

20:54:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I feel like the paying for our own ships thing is unlikely."

20:54:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Constantine?"

20:54:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "More likely is that we'd borrow them like we currently do from Unreality."

20:54:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah?"

20:54:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you can, will you try to keep an ear and and eye out for how things over in Velouria?"

20:54:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

20:55:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's where you are going, right?"

20:55:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if I can face my family, so I wasn't planning to go home."

20:55:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was going to try and go to the crash sites."

20:55:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, well wherever you go, an update of how things are on the ground would be nice."

20:55:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And help clear away rubble and rebuild."

20:55:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Certainly."

20:55:36 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "One for a nest? Tier three or lower."

20:55:50 [Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm game."

20:55:51 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Alright."

20:55:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've been trying to arrange for some medical supplies and food drops, since they don't want people touching the Merry Band stuff, though I doubt there's anyting wrong with it."

20:55:57 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "He can go if he likes."

20:56:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Poisoning a bunch of random folks isn't really kelsey's style."

20:56:18 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Sure, Johnathon, Real Earth lounge."

20:56:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think in this case, Kelsey actually does want to help."

20:56:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

20:56:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I agree Constantine."

20:56:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "However, the administration not wanting to accept anything from Kelsey doesn't surprise me."

20:56:43 [Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "My suit is at SVP."

20:56:57 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "We'll go pick it up."

20:57:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right, since they've been pushing the whole thing about unregs and pirates being the biggest threat."

20:57:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

20:57:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah I'll listen for people's opinions."

20:57:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they're willing to share them."

20:58:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thanks man.. Be careful down there, people probably aren't too happy with us. Hopefully they don't even know it's you."

20:58:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Since our names were never released."

20:58:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I'm hoping, but I feel I need to face it either way."

20:58:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be careful."

20:58:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

20:58:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright guys, I'll see you when I return."

20:58:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I hear that. I want do whatever I can to help those folks."

20:58:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Take care."

21:05:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:31:16 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Go ahead."

22:31:19 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, you don't have to do that Katina."

22:31:29 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "There will be more times to go."

22:31:55 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Meet at Accord, or Old Earth."

22:32:01 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Katina can have my spot."

23:18:02 Major Change:

23:18:02 
Asteroid Mining Expansion

Miners with bronze, silver, or gold mining licenses now have a random chance of being offered a special type of asteroid to process. You can decline this offer and work a normal site instead if you prefer.

* Metal-rich: These asteroids simply have more ore to process, and are a much bigger target for poachers.

* Comet: On comets, you may extract water ice for a boost to your payout. Ice is extracted using separate ice mining buildings, but the ice does not require processing.

* Radioactive: The third tier processors and higher will be able to extract radioactives as well as metal from your ore, boosting your payout. To support the power requirements of these advanced processors, radioisotope thermoelectric generators will be available.

The asteroids you're used to are now known as rocky asteroids.

Special asteroid types should provide approximately a 10-20% boost to payout at the cost of the special considerations outlined above. As always, please report any outsized rewards or other issues with the new asteroids.


23:18:44 [MTTS] alc_71: That all sounds great. Thanks.

23:18:46 [MTTS] Ulias: That sounds neato mosquito.

23:18:47 [MTTS] something: Very cool.

23:19:16 [MTTS] something: Will new drones be required to transport new resources?

23:19:44 [MTTS] blindbat84: Ooooo I likey very muchy.

23:19:46 [MTTS] usfolks: Oh nice. Thanks.

23:19:56 [MTTS] Butchulla: That just sounds awesome. I look forward to seeing this.

23:19:59 [MTTS] Squidmind: No. I might continue to expand it, though. Special buildings for specific asteroid types open up some possibilities.

23:20:26 [MTTS] something: I had been thinking that you'd need a special type of transport bay to keep ice from melting, then I realised, space.

23:20:27 [MTTS] muhala: When you talk about the third tier processors, do you mean processors or drilling platforms? Just wanting to make sure I understood properly.

23:20:40 [MTTS] voyager1000: That looks pretty nice, the change implies only more poacher targets on metal rich roids, is that how it's meant to read?

23:20:45 [MTTS] Squidmind: Processors.

23:21:11 [Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Crias clear."

23:21:42 [MTTS] muhala: Awesome, thank you. I like mining, but it is becoming somewhat less challenging. This will add awesome spice to the dish of my credit serving.

23:22:02 [MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, there are only extra poachers on metal-rich types, for now at least. The cost of the other two types is more research and building.

23:22:44 [MTTS] Squidmind: Though I'm hoping the metal-rich asteroids will make it more worthwhile to research higher tier defenses. Getting some use out of the higher tier buildings was one of the major goals here.

23:22:58 [MTTS] Ulias: I usually do that anyways just for fun, personally.

23:23:09 [MTTS] voyager1000: It'd definitely be nice to have reasons to use the larger, more expensive to research buildings.

23:23:12 [MTTS] Grunze: I think you have succeeded.

23:23:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a letter, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, a pair of gray canvas sneakers, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

23:23:27 You blink heavily and then doze off.

23:23:58 [MTTS] something: Even without a minmax reason to do it, I think a bunch of us did experiment with it for the hell of it at least once.

23:24:21 [MTTS] muhala: Oh and thank you for giving us an estimate on what we should expect for the payout. That will help with any overpay issues.

23:24:38 [MTTS] voyager1000: I definitely researched everything at least once, just to try it.

23:24:55 [MTTS] something: The only thing I've never messed with is the drone upgrade stuff.

You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

23:55:37 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a letter, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

23:55:49 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

23:55:52 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a letter, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
