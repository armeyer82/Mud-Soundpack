Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an
insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

are noisy and echo loudly through the area when activated, you can still hear
the footsteps of pilots and travelers as they make their way along the wide
metal stairway leading up to the landing pad and down to lower levels of the

Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to

Cadet Katie Celayla (AEU Light Combatant)
This is a fairly light battlesuit, painted dark green with silver trim. It
resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's
torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of hydraulics and
cables with some protective plating. A laser attachment is mounted to the right
wrist. A minidrone applicator is attached to the left wrist, a hose leading to a
bulky device on the back of the suit.
It appears to be 11% damaged.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

feel lame."

I've done is the rats pod mission. All the others, I haven't found enough rat
parts or haven't tried."
Kim Saunders speaks into her red metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, it's just a
case of try every day and see what they have on offer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "I do the rats
scouts all the time. And occasionally the bari corpse one. I usually do rats
drills, but that's about it."

ground combat, I was disappointed to see that too."

then I'll be able to do beacons and nests, and I can gather everyone together
and do propper stuff, one would think?"

seen, I think beacons would more than make up for it, plus nests and whatever
else there is."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

Hi there Shule. I am back for a goodly long while now, and I am sending the onyx

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage
dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and an
insulated purple sleeping bag here.

lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[Starship "Vengeance"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a black leather captain's chair, and a wormhole
drive tracer here.

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,

[Starship "Albatross"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

a pilot, training or something?"
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was actually thinking I should ask
you -- have you submitted an application?"
[Newbie Help] Daniel Blackwell transmits, "You need to submit a profile, if
that's what you're asking?"
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or yeah, a profile."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "No, not yet. Will do that. More?"
[Newbie Help] Katina Faye transmits, "Type help profile or help basic profile."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nope that's it, and there's also a
character concept that comes first, if you haven't done that already."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Ok, will start reading the help file,
then I guess things will be fine. Thanks all."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Sorry guys, I now know what to do
(hopefully), but I miss the how."

[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Done a basic profile, but what about the
profile itself? How?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Do you mean you've done a character
concept and want to do a profile now? If so, all the helpfiles in the profile
category are really helpful."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "Well, read them, and no, not sure i've
done the concept. I miss the how. I mean, I know what to do, almost, but I miss
how to do it."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well the profile you do by typing
profile."
[Newbie Help] Constantine Stone transmits, "They didn't do concepts when I was
doing this so I don't know how to do that. Maybe type concept?"
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The profile and the concept are two
separate things that you submit separately, the concept before the profile."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh you just meant the command. Sorry, I
don't know either."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "No, concept doesn't work. That's exactly
why I ask. I know what to do, but the helpfile says nothing about how, or I
can't read. Profile command work."
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "*laughs*."
[Newbie Help] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yeah, maybe if you type profile it'll
tell you what you'd have to do to submit your concept?"
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "No, but since I have already used the
profile command, it now says the concept is queued *sighs*."
A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it
into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.
[Newbie Help] Julius Smith transmits, "So, the profile is the concept that is
the profile. I'm not sure if that is logic, but that's how it is *smiles*.
Thanks all."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah it does,
umm, I think head down from the landing pad, then out the northeast exit of the
spaceport."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then the mall is
near the south end of town."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ah ok."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It really doesn't
matter whether you take the northeast or south exit of the spaceport. Both are

direction."

the mall has a pet store, actually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Heh. You don't
need tools to refit fuses."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "If you read that book
called in the shop, there's a store called Betty's pets somewhere on chetumal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "It should be in the
box labeled library in the conference room, unless someone else borrowed it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I really don't recall
either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay. Well,
I guess it could be in the mall. It could also be around town somewhere."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Yeah, I'll find it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Ugh, so slow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I upgraded a

retains its exploration sensors."

have a way to check that."

the max velocity is on the advanced? I'm curious if ti's changed at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It was unchanged

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Katie sighs mornfully.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs. "Yeah... Probably so,
constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "So what you
thinking. Outccord by Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring
Celebratory Event, death of the AEU by february?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I hope we last a
bit longer than that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But cutting ties
with the Accord won't help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Not under best
we won't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Death of the AEU, am
I missing something here?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Our current
president has arranged for us to leave the Accord of Free Worlds."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A lot of people
are worried that doing so will weaken the Union."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Anyone
arranged for his resignation and application form to the nuthouse yet?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "I assume accord of
free worlds has stuff we use, so leaving would be a bad thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Bah!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "Do we as average
citizens get a say in this?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That may be true, but
it's not really about the stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It has stuff
that we as pilots use, yeah, so it will be bad for us. The citizens of the AEU
likely see the Accord as a pointless credit sink."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Heh no? Does a
bear shit in a crystal toilet?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is why
Best had the massive support he needed to do this, I imagine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. we had a say in it
when folks voted for the president that said he wanted to do it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin Fox transmits, "If you give him a
crystal toilet, he might."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Justin laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Hmm! Have to
try with aytheor next time he's around."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Leaving the
Accord might actually improve our economy in the short term, or even in the long
term. But I think the main issue is that humanity's best chance against invasion
by the Outsiders is presenting a united front."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "And, I can
officially say, I didn't vote for best. I didn't vote at all, was too young."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We actually fought for
months to stop it actually. With lots of escalations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley transmits, "Why are you always
picking on aytheor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade Burkley laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "Because he
picks on me? Swings and. Uh, what's the saying swings and... something or
other."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jade giggles and transmits, I guess that makes
it fair. and yeah constantine, I have to agree that if we're going to fight
outsiders, it should be a united front, so I can see why this might be an issue
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm hoping that
if they do come for us, Best will know that our only chance is to throw
everything we have in with everyone else's efforts."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And that if they
come for the Union specifically, the Accord and other alliances will still help
out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "You think?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Cadet Katie Celayla transmits, "The AEU will
be a high priority target, that goes without saying. And considering the accord
seems to have a bigger navy than we do, I'm not liking our chances. Considering
further, the outsiders took on all three alliances before the revolution and
won? I don't like our chances."

sound good at all."

are definitely worth more credits than others. I really don't know the exact
values."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I always thought

want to bother collecting another 1000 before turning in the trip artifacts
though."

but why ould you want to? The trip artifacts will pay much better. 3 points for
each one I think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but I
wanted to maximize my gains from the bubble before cashing any of those in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Reasoning that
the trip artifacts would give me 3 no matter what."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My hope is that

point there I guess."

[Starship "Bonzai Trout"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a dark green leather captain's chair, a wormhole drive tracer, and a
decoy beacon launcher here.
You can go up and out.

uh...crap I can't think of the term...cell agin or somethin?"

guy."

felo...telepaths that are mean."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I haven't either.
Though...that makes me wonder about some of the felo on my mean ship. I have
some that have that typical eyes and nose we've seen on those guys, but they're
mean. I haven't spent enough time just kinda hanging around them though to see."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I've come up with a few maned
in the line when I moved 'em round about too much and caused 'em to breed too
fast...but never had a mean telepath that I know of."

horizontal pupils?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Eerr."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yeah, and the noses."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Vertical nose I mean."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I got what you meant."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. I think I've seen a
couple that weren't like that though. And I know I've seen a couple new eye
colors. Michael Kennedy has one of my line as a pet. A golden felo with silver
eyes. He named it Sylivia but spelled it kinda odd, more like silver."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "She's a real beauty."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "She is. He still hasn't got
her back from me. I've been waiting for him to ask."

know to talk to ya."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kennedy."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I just sorta figured that
he'd ask for her."

thing he said to me on the fringe channel after it happened, he hasn't mentioned
her at all."

beginnin of the felo life cycle than the end."

where they are. If I use get treat or treats. It just gets the treat. Without
the prompt."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Possibly. Try get treats from container.
That seems to just give me the treat, but if you aren't getting the prompt it's
worth a try."

[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Though uh, I'm not quite
sure how a trash can can be pretty. I'll get back to ya on that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs. "There's some in some of them
ladies shops that are rather...pretty."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lace and whatnot."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Every time I see that
asteroid one on old earth, I want it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah. That's a pretty cool
can."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "But tegan, she is best
sanitation drone cool robot ever."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh heck yes."
Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Constantine. If you have not
met Tegan yet. You're gonna love her."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And...what's that
planet...Fringe place...uh...the one where nobody can spell worth a dang? With
the ones dressed up like maids and whatnot."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who is that?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nissi's sanitation bot
thingy."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."
[Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "You have to use a different noun, and I think
you have to be sure and specify the table or whatever."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Tegan is an adorable little
circular robot that dings at you. Takes your garbage. And is just cool. She's
nissi's."
[Newbie Help] Eli Grey transmits, "It's something along those lines, at any
rate."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Lots of little dingdings
and beepbeeps."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh...try a multiple word match to the
name maybe. Get felo treats. Something like that."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm running out of nouns. And it's
driving me batty because I've fixed this before."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Try more than one word."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well that shall remain unsolved for
now. I ran out of treats."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well that's one way to do it."
[Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well yeah. It solved the problem. In a
way."
Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the north.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Man...why did I mention
tegan before. now I want glorious hot chocolate."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Yes, it's a little-known
secret that Tegan takes all that stuff people give her and turns it into
glorious hot chocolate."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I should hope not."
[General Communication] "While that would be super amazingly fucking cool."
Evenia Callseah laughs. "I just menat that usually where tegan is. So is the
little hot chocolate robot."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That would be super amazinly
freakin disgustin."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well that too. But it'd be a
cool process. I wouldn't go anywhere near said tegan hot chocolate though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That from a person who
has eaten felo treats."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Did someone say hot white chocolate
served in robotic fashion?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I have. I do not do this
anymore, however."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Somebody threaten not to kiss
ya?"
[General Communication] "Nah." Evenia Callseah laughs. "I just decided that was
a touch too weird, even for me."
Prissy the old big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Yes Eli. We were discussing
that very thing."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I didn't know that was
possible."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah chuckles.
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I saw a wooden kitten once."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew sighs. "Not again."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "What did it do? This wooden
kitten?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Do? It was made of wood. It just
stood and there.. Being wood."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If it did something, I'd probably
freak out."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Are you sure? Did it not
whisper to you dreams of future glorious rift exploration, to find the amazing
wooden kitten oort?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, well yeah, of course it did
that. I thought you meant something strange."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No no. Are you kidding? I
would never mean something strange or outlandish."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Eli."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "ELI!"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nicolette!"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I like you well enough
and all, but you're not right."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Pot and the kettle."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey libs people, what kinda plant
you got over there?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Leafy orange?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We have a few plants. That
one, not being one of them."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We do however, have orange
pods. If only that were the orangeplant."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Are you after a certain kind
of plant, invaders person?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Maybe that's not the kind
of plant he was looking for."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I was thinking a fern. Maybe even a
shrubbery."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah sighs. "Alas, we do not have those
either."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "There are shaving kits,
if you've got a shrubbery problem."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah giggles.
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Or maybe put some of that
Beard-Be-Gone down there."
[General Communication] Eli Grey laughs. "That sounds like it would burn or
something."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Ow. Yeah."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, joking aside, I was tinking a
double speed plant.. we have one but I don't really want to wait on Ather."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "That. We do not have sadly.
Um...Goss does. I wanna say Ali's org does. I think cats does."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I can however, offer you a
glorious double torp plant. Or perhaps you would prefer a mini damage plant? Or
if that isn't your style, there is always our sensor charge hybrid."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Failing that, there is our
torpedo resistance plant."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah giggles.
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm, the mini one and the sensor
charge both sounds nice, though for different ships obviously."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "My next effort. Is going to
be a mini damage. Torp resist hybrid."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "We murdered our life support
plant. It was kinda pointless."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. since plants produce oxygen,
isn't a life support plant just a regular plant?"
[General Communication] "No you nutball." Evenia Callseah laughs. "It boosted
life support on a ship. But um...It had a drawback that made it a touch
pointless."
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Did you ever figure out what that
one did?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The life support? It's
downside?"
[General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I think you told me before that
it was charge. I was wondering about the um.. pods I think they are?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh. Nope, not a clue. That
fucking thing eludes all forms of discovery. If you have any ideas, I'll give
you cuttings to test them. We're fresh out of ideas."
You hear Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's metallic gold touch einrophone ringing.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's metallic gold touch einrophone stops ringing.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders
in from the north.
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo suddenly jumps onto a white four poster
rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a
soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large
periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large
periwinkle bed pillow on it.
