00:01:45 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

00:01:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

NEW EARTH (OMEGA V)
Year of Discovery: 2142
Year of Colonisation: 2157
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 10 billion
Primary Orbit: Omega
Important Locations: New Phoenix, Landfall, Velouria, Christabel Mountains, Encatan Peninsula, Mount Trifad

Unusually for the First Great Colonisation Rush, New Earth's first city was not named after its colony ship, the Intrepid.  Instead, after landing at dawn the captain called the sunrise over the highest peak of Christabel mountain 'a phoenix', and thus the first town became known as New Phoenix.  Notable families in this initial wave of colonisation were members of the Mendes Syndicate, the Shetland family, and a collective of African Nationalists.  Many of the early colony ships contained vastly wealthy families or individuals, especially entrepreneurs who wanted to take their chances on a new world; as such New Earth (as one of the few surviving original colonies) became a planet filled with the super-rich, assisted by the eventual worldwide depression back on what became Old Earth.  In the wake of that depression and subsequent communications blackout, New Earth reached out to the other newly formed colonies and the few who reached back joined with it to form what is now the Alliance of ExtraSolar Unions.  In the years after the construction of New Phoenix, a small town grew up around the remnants of the Intrepid some fifty kilometers from New Phoenix that would eventually name itself Landfall.

Notable Life:
Omega V has a rich variety of life, though recent events have changed some elements of this.
The velourian sparklehawk (a bird-like creature native to the forest regions on the coast of the Velourian sea), the phoenician boar (a rodent/boar creature about a meter long native to the plains surrounding New Phoenix), and the pellis mermaid (a predatory pseudosimian that hid in the shallows of rivers and ponds much like a crocodile or the predecessors of whales and dolphins), are now considered extinct in the wild after the accidental introduction to the New Earth ecosystem of the xenological superpredator known as felo.  
The carnivorous plants known as nepenthes mobilis or the mobile pitcher plant are endemic to Mt. Trifad and the surrounding jungles; usually easily avoided due to their vibrant colouration but dangerous to the unwary who see the pretty flowers and take a closer look - their projectile hooked stings can paralyse in seconds and slowly drag even a human into their large urn-like pitchers, while the vast quantities of digestive enzymes within said pitchers cause third degree burns within minutes. They are capable of locomotion up to 4 kilometers per hour, but if they find no prey they must regularly root themselves to absorb nutrients from soil. 
The encatan megahornet is a large venomous insect that can grow up to a foot long, originally discovered on the Encatan peninsula but variants are known to exist across most of the temperate regions of the planet. While highly dangerous, megahornets tend to avoid building nests near to human settlements.

TELEX
Year of Discovery: 2144
Year of Colonisation: 2159
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 8 billion
Primary Orbit: Omega
Important Locations: New Roanoke, Providence, Nature Preserve, The Heartwood Forests

Telex was colonised by the colony ship Roanoke, with the town of New Roanoke being formed after it was dismantled.  Primarily American colonists were on board the Roanoke, and they took to the new world by looking back in history - to the wild west.  Much of the early settlers, with the aid of advanced technology, treated Telex as if it were the frontier of the old west back on Old Earth.  With the discovery of the gargantuan heartwood trees a divide began between those who wanted to remain close to their roots (no pun intended) and those who felt that they could use the heartwoods as the basis for canopy colonies, the first of which became Providence.

Notable Life: 
The Heartwood is a massive tree, dwarfing even the giant redwoods from Old Earth and its forests cover much of the southern hemisphere.  Entire unique ecosystems exist within their roots, their branches and even within the heartwood trunks themselves. After the creation of the canopy town of Providence, the human colonists began to create their own habitation within the great trees.
One of the reasons that the 'wild west' attitude became such a common element for Telexans was the discovery of the auroch.  Named after the ancient forebear of the cow, the auroch is a pseudobovine native to the Telexan plains. Standing two meters tall on average but incredibly docile, the aurochs travel in vast herds of thousands, but were quickly domesticated and corralled to farm them by the first settlers.  After careful examination to prove their meat and milk were not harmful, the auroch became a staple of the Telexan diet since even a single auroch could feed a family for a week.  Today, aurochs can be found in many meat-farms across the Union, but millions of herds still roam free across the plains of Telex.

ZION
Year of Discovery: 2144
Year of Colonisation: 2159
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 1 billion
Primary Orbit: Omega IV
Important Locations: Zion Sublunar Habitation Network, Zion Publishing HQ

Zion is in actuality a small moon orbiting the gas giant Omega IV as opposed to an actual planet.  The Roanoke's sister ship Zion landed on what was at the time known only as Omega IVa and the moon was named for the colony ship.  With the surface uninhabitable, the colonists attempted an experiment - an entirely subterranean existence. The colony itself
01:12:30  is not multiple towns or cities, but a single massive cave and tunnel network that weaves paths kilometers below the crust.  Its atmosphere is entirely generated by massive machines at the core of the moon.

Notable Life:
Being an airless moon, Zion has no native life. All life forms in the Zion sublunar habitat caverns are Earth-stock, but many have begun to evolve to adapt to their new environs.

HYPERION
Year of Discovery: 2147
Year of Colonisation: 2162
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 8 billion
Primary Orbit: Cheyanne's Star
Important Locations: Avalon, The Sea of Grass, Jacktown, The Felo Sanctuary

The colony ship Avalon was sent to Cheyanne's Star as part of the first Great Colonisation Rush along with its sister ships the Iram and Shangri-La.  As with the other successful colonies the starship was dismantled on Hyperion to create the first city at its landing site.  Shortly after the creation of the town of Avalon a group of survivalists and wilderness experts led by one Jack McIntyre headed out into the untamed lands to forge their own path, creating Jacktown in honour of their leader.  This spirit of adventure led to the primary spaceport of Hyperion being constructed just outside Jacktown while Avalon, lying a few dozen kilometers away, remains starship-free to this day.

Notable Life: 
Of the life on Hyperion, two species enjoy widespread notoriety. 
First is the black rautine, a pseudoavian species popularized by stories of their rare attacks on humans, similar to how the great white shark was known to pre-Diaspora humans despite the vast unlikelihood of ever being harmed by one. A single rautine is an unassuming beast: a small four-winged birdlike creature, though with a razor-sharp beak. However, rautines exist in vast swarms and make their homes in very large communal nests assembled from blades of grass. They may earn their name partly from the fact that particularly large flocks of them have been known to darken the sun. A black rautine on its own quickly dies; they act as a social organism not unlike ants and bees, divided into castes of scouts, hunters, nest-tenders, and breeders. Rautines are insatiable omnivores and can quickly strip an area of all edible material whether vegetable, animal, or in rare cases, human. Despite being voracious eaters, however, they avoid the unfamiliar and usually steer clear of humans and their settlements, but an unlucky person who accidentally disturbs a black rautine nest is in for a harrowing, if not deadly, experience.
The other well-known species of Hyperion is rather more prosaic though, in practical terms, far more deadly. Hyperion seagrass is not found in water; rather, the grass itself is said to form a sea. The blue-green blades of grass cover thousands upon thousands of square miles and are easily seen from space. The "depth" of the S
01:12:30 ea of Grass ranges from the height of a man to perhaps twice or thrice that in the middle of Hyperion's many vast rolling plains. Within the Sea of Grass, everything is obscured save for the sun when directly overhead, making finding one's way without assistance nearly impossible. The animals that live in the Sea of Grass are believed to be attuned to Hyperion's magnetic field for the purposes of navigation. Predators are especially able to take advantage of the obscuring grass, and can pounce upon the unwary with no warning whatsoever. However, most who become lost in the Sea of Grass simply wander until exposure or dehydration claim them.

ENDYMION
Year of Discovery: 2147
Year of Colonisation: 2162
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 6 billion
Primary Orbit: Cheyanne's Star
Important Locations: Iram, Lut-Kavir, Margo Kara, Taklama, Northern Ryn

The colony ship Iram reached Cheyanne's Star with its sister ships the Avalon and Shangri-La during the first Great Colonisation Rush.  Bayendar landed on Endymion, discovering an arid, desert world with thin temperate regions near the poles.  While the colony ship was dismantled at one of these regions to form the first city, the colonists spread outward and worked hard to find oases in the deep desert that covered most of the world.

Notable Life:
While a desert world, Endymion does possess native life.  
The neo-thylacine is a lithe nocturna
01:12:30 l pseudomammal that stays near an oasis in their territory and hunts for smaller prey when they approach to drink.  In the deep continental deserts, spotting a neo-thylacine is often seen as a sign of good luck, as it shows you are near to an oasis or source of water and life.
A harmless animal that nonetheless has an undeserved reputation for danger and terrifying people is the jba fofi, known colloquially as the nightmare spider.  Possessing ten spindly limbs that can be up to a meter long and a body that can be just as wide, the jba fofi is a sandy-coloured pseudoarachnid that hides in the desert sands to wait for small creatures to pass by close enough to snatch, akin to the sand spiders of Old Earth. However, jbo fofi avoid larger creatures and when disturbed by something such as a human it will leap out of the sand in an attempt to escape, but doing so can often be surprising for the wayward human as the two-meter large alien spider appears from nowhere.

AENEA
Year of Discovery: 2147
Year of Colonisation: 2162
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 5 billion
Primary Orbit: Cheyanne's Star
Important Locations: Shangri-La Habitat, Personal Envirodomes

The Shangri-La was the third of the trio of colony ships travelling to Cheyanne's Star alongide its sister ships the Avalon and Iram.  Discovering Aenea was an airless world, the colonists within the ship saw this as a challenge - creating self-sufficient environment domes and habitats that would allow them to enjoy the majesty of this unique world without having to terraform it and lose its natural charm.  Vast landscapes of blue-grey rocks and silver skies create a beautiful, if deadly, environment.

Notable Life:
Aenea is naturally lifeless; the only living creatures are Earth-stock brought by the colonists and living in their farm and hydroponics domes.

BIKURA
Year of Discovery: 2143
Year of Colonisation: 2158
Colonised by: United Nations
Population (approximate): 6 billion
Primary Orbit: Riverway C
Important Locations: Samsara, Moksha, Kashi, Canyon Village

The colony ship Samsara was the ship that arrived at Bikura, a hot rocky world.  The colonists dismantled the ship and created the town of Samsara in the northern temperate regions, but eventually a larger city that became known as Moksha became the capital in the rocky desert.  The primary spaceport was constructed a few kilometers outside the city of Moksha, where Canyon Village slowly formed around it.

Notable Life:
Bikura is not home to much life, but such native life that is well-known tend to be reptilian.
The greater desert basilisk is a half-meter long pseudoreptile that can spit venom up to thirty meters in order to stun its prey, and able to run at almost 30 kilometers an hour for short distances. 
On the other side of the spectrum is the sunrock salamander, a three meter long behemoth of a pseudoreptile that has a body temperature of almost eighty degrees Celsius which it can raise higher for short periods in order to burn an attacker that attempts to grasp its scales, and also possesses glands that allow it to produce a gelling agent which, when combined with its blood, form sticky globules that burst into flame upon contact with something solid.  Luckily, these creatures reside only in the hottest and brightest regions of the rocky desert and flee from human activity.

HOYT
Year of Discovery: 2143
Year of Colonisation: N/A
Colonised by: N/A
Population (approximate): 5
Primary Orbit: Bikura
Important Locations: Hoyt Spaceport, Hoyt Repair & Rearm

An airless, lifeless, dead world.  Hoyt is not a colony, but an industrial moon where there is little in the way of habitation.

--

DURE
Year of Discovery: 2143
Year of Colonisation: N/A
Colonised by: N/A
Population (approximate): 23
Primary Orbit: Bikura
Important Locations: Corbin Memorial Prison

An airless, lifeless, dead world.  Dure is not a colony; instead being used by the Union (and the other alliances) as a prison planet for civilian pilots and others.

01:12:48 [MTTS] Squidmind: Ricolachen: I started off planning to just list every major city, then realised that would be very annoying to see.  I had to just pick a few.

01:13:24 [MTTS] davetaylor: I'm always really curious what Siebal would have been like.

01:15:33 [MTTS] Squidmind: I've always pictured it as a bit like a futuristic Havana, but it's not something we've ever really set in stone.

01:16:15 [MTTS] davetaylor: That would actually be a great thing to have in game, like an old town, or the remains of.

01:18:53 [MTTS] Squidmind: The city of Seibal exists on an IC level, it's just not open to pilots!

01:19:03 [MTTS] Squidmind: Though it would have had some damage due to the subjugation, yes.

01:19:34 [MTTS] kayden: So is the league the only alliance with two locations open via the pod system?

01:19:53 [MTTS] kayden: Been here forever and I can not remember.

01:22:19 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

01:22:19 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, and a fuzzy stuffed bear here.
You can go south and out.

01:23:38 [MTTS] davetaylor: Well, think of all the gadgets that didn't happen in SC, and all the climate change that was probably avoided.

01:23:56 [MTTS] Squidmind: The real world and the world of SC diverged significantly in the 50s, so it's hard to pinpoint any specific event that did or didn't happen and explain why.

01:24:21 [MTTS] ryoga: Hydroponics. Seems legit.

01:24:23 [MTTS] usfolks: No Trump presidency. Sign me up. Oh wait...never mind.

01:24:54 [MTTS] kayden: Best basically is Trump. Mixed with a bit of that brit PM lady.

01:25:05 [MTTS] usfolks: Yes I know. That's why the second part of the comment.

01:25:08 [MTTS] davetaylor: Yep, Trump and Brexit in one issue.

01:25:37 [MTTS] ryoga: Best isn't like Trump, really.

01:25:39 [MTTS] usfolks: So glad it's Outccord. AEUExit is too hard to say.

01:25:56 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:26:35 [MTTS] ryoga: Other way around actually.

01:26:50 [MTTS] usfolks: Best is definitely smarter. He doesn't use social media.

01:26:58 [MTTS] kaite: Yeah please let's not go there Best is uh yeah Trmps distant grandson.

01:28:48 [MTTS] kayden: Honestly the divergent timeline is kind of cool. I makes you wonder of the things that were avoided I just wish eight, nine years into the plot is it that our ships looked a bit less cobbled together.

01:28:56 Not much to see out there.

You can go south, up, and out.

01:29:30 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:29:31 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:29:31 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:29:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:29:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:29:41 [Tactical Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Can you trace it?"

01:29:46 The ship is already moving.

01:29:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:29:47 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Beacon A-23. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:29:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:29:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Spinward Cluster."

01:29:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:29:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:29:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:29:55 Streams of stellar gases and glittering clusters of debris unfurl in every direction in nearby space.

01:31:30 [MTTS] kayden: That is a bit creepy.

01:31:40 [MTTS] Squidmind: Pretty much every early event in the AEU election arc had us do something and then it happen in real life a week later.  We seriously considered just ending the plot at that point.

01:31:48 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:31:48 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:31:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:31:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:49:24 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

01:49:24 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

01:49:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:49:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:49:29 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:49:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:49:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:49:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:50:17 Would you like to see a list of possible destinations?

01:50:18 [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:50:19 Please enter the name of the sector you would like to travel to.

01:50:19 [Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

01:50:21 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:50:21 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:50:24 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

01:50:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:50:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:50:29 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:00:33 You begin familiarizing yourself with the engineering stations and making various changes to your liking.

02:01:20 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:01:21 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

02:01:22 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:01:22 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:01:24 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:01:30 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have been given clearance to launch.

02:01:30 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:01:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:01:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to The Cross. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:01:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:01:44 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Cross."

02:01:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:01:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:01:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:41:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:41:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

03:42:56 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into the PA microphone, "I'll tell you the truth. My first 2 beacons, I think I got like...maybe 2% of the shots in."

03:42:57 The starship transitions into another sector.

03:43:00 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

03:43:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:43:01 Proper in-sector coordinates not reached.  AutoVector program aborted.

03:43:02 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:43:02 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:43:03 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

03:43:06 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:43:06 Evenia an Eachtrannach stumbles, then falls heavily to the floor.

03:43:08 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:43:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:43:09 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:43:10 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

03:43:21 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

03:43:25 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 776" has launched from Space Station Alpha.

03:43:29 Saira Sorrenson's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I just keep losing them, then trying to find them again just to lose them again. I'm too slow, currently. I suppose that, too, takes practice."

03:43:37 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "It does."

03:43:45 You pat Saira Sorrenson on the back.

03:43:46 Saira Sorrenson smiles at you.

03:43:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That might explain the devouring."

03:43:48 Evenia an Eachtrannach's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh definitely, and to be fair, even I still lose some of those quick little fuckers. We all do."

03:43:50 You smile at Saira Sorrenson.

03:43:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like.. it ate a coffee table, a chair and a um, I think it was a plant. And then spit out a coffee table made of all of those things."

03:44:04 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

03:44:05 Saira Sorrenson smiles.

03:44:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

03:44:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hm. Interesting."

03:44:19 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

03:44:19 You are credited with 2,737,913.78 AEU credits of bounty.
0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

03:44:20 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay folks five minute break to use the head and what not."

03:44:24 You say, "I was afraid people wouldn't let me be on beacons again."

03:44:25 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

03:44:29 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Ok."

03:44:34 Evenia an Eachtrannach's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks ali."

03:45:18 You grin.

03:45:21 You hug Saira Sorrenson.

03:45:22 A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Evenia an Eachtrannach's neck.

03:45:24 Saira Sorrenson says, "You lot are awfully understanding. It's refreshing."

03:45:27 You say to Saira, "You did great."

03:45:29 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "I don't say nice things unless they're deserved."

03:45:34 You nod.

03:45:47 Saira Sorrenson says, "Father was certain I'd be tattooed and pierced within an hour of completeing my training."

03:45:50 Saira Sorrenson grins.

03:45:59 You chuckle.

03:46:05 You say, "Well, nothing wrong with that."

03:46:06 Saira Sorrenson says, "Instead, I'm getting help. Fancy that."

03:46:07 Saira Sorrenson grins.

03:46:10 Evenia an Eachtrannach looks down at herself thoughtfully.

03:46:13 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "I um."

03:46:14 Evenia an Eachtrannach blushes.

03:46:17 Saira Sorrenson giggles.

03:46:19 You grin at Saira Sorrenson.

03:46:30 Saira Sorrenson says, "It's not a bad thing save to my uptight dad. No worries."

03:46:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "One guy, did something stupid and shoved it down his pants. I guess he thought he was gonna show it who's boss or something. It took his penis. Crazy thing was, there was no wound, the only think injured was his pride."

03:46:41 Evenia an Eachtrannach grins.

03:46:44 You grin.

03:46:46 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "I love my piercings."

03:46:58 You grin at Evenia an Eachtrannach.

03:47:01 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "I've got more than you see now, I just don't have anything in them at the moment."

03:47:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores laughs.

03:47:10 Saira Sorrenson asks, "Really?"

03:47:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's hilarious."

03:47:13 Saira Sorrenson glances at Evenia an Eachtrannach.

03:47:16 Evenia an Eachtrannach nods.

03:47:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And he got it back, but he carried the thing around in a cooler trying to find someone who could reatach it. And it wasn't like, dead or anything it looked like a perfectly health penis in a cooler."

03:47:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Someone come join us on beacons."

03:47:28 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "Many more."

03:47:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can't, I'm too busy talking about rift insanity."

03:47:47 Saira Sorrenson says, "I'm going to get a plume of flame the day I manage to kick gunning's arse. Give my mum and dad a heart attack, but grandma'll like it."

03:47:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

03:47:58 Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

03:48:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But no, I really can't though, sorry Shule."

03:48:01 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "What, now?"

03:48:03 You cheer for Saira Sorrenson!

03:48:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I have room for one."

03:48:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'll help out. Im not as distracted anymore."

03:48:33 Saira leans back in her chair, a lopsided little grin plastered in place.

03:48:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident cheers for Tara Flores!

03:48:36 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "Oh Johann? Did you hear what I said about the key?"

03:48:49 Saira Sorrenson turns on a scorched metachannel FTL communicator.

03:48:57 You grin at Saira Sorrenson.

03:48:59 Saira Sorrenson

03:48:59 She appears to be 18 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has sun-kissed tawny skin. Her body is delicate with sensually curved hips and shapely calves. She has lissome shoulders and pert breasts. Her face is symmetrically ovular and high cheekboned, with an aquiline nose and gently rounded chin. Her lips are full and pomegranate red and occasionally part to reveal a set of even, white teeth. Beneath a set of gracefully arched eyebrows, her eyes are slate blue and heavy-lidded. Her waist-length, silky hair is russet and teased into loosely flowing waves down her back. She has meticulously manicured light pink fingernails.
 She is wearing a black velvet beret, a long black sleeveless silk dress, a silvery gray silk sash, and a pair of black jelly ballet flats with a matching bow. She is also wearing a fine gold link necklace with a light-catching red crystal teardrop pendant, a pair of shimmering red crystal drop earrings, and a glittering red crystal bracelet. Her face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying a large suitcase in her right hand.
Saira Sorrenson frowns at a scorched metachannel FTL communicator.

03:49:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm on the landing pad at New Earth."

03:49:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Good luck tara, hope I didn't scare you off from the glory of exploring deep space using the rift. Nad happy hunting once again guys."

03:49:13 Saira Sorrenson says, "This thing must've lost a battle with an angry worker at some point."

03:49:17 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "I sent you a key to the ship where sean's kitten is. In case I was busy. So he could get it as soon as possible. The ship is on chet."

03:49:26 [General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "You didnt!"

03:49:34 Tara Flores walks in from the west.

03:49:40 You say to Saira, "What?"

03:49:57 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "It's the green kitten."

03:50:06 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "I will know, if you touch the others."

03:50:10 Keying her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.

03:50:14 You say to Evenia, "You're a green kitten?"

03:50:19 Evenia an Eachtrannach pokes you in the ribs!

03:50:22 Tara Flores says into the PA microphone, "Did you mean another one? Someone else is managing this station."

03:50:36 Evenia an Eachtrannach tramps west.

03:50:37 Vartija the arachnoid security robot skitters after Evenia an Eachtrannach.

03:50:50 [Starship "Oh Lordy, The Lasers!"; Weapons Room Two]

03:50:50 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

03:53:21 With everything arranged, you settle into the damage control station.

03:53:32 Evenia an Eachtrannach says, "Behave, or I'll have to go change these panties."

03:53:36 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Once the beacon is launched do not come into the control room unless we are utterly getting pounded. The pilot is known for bouts of anger and ill tempered."

03:53:51 Vernos Bailey's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Kidding, kidding."

03:54:01 Evenia an Eachtrannach says into her mirror finish chrome metachannel FTL communicator, "He so is."

04:22:13 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

04:22:13 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:22:14 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

04:22:14 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

04:22:15 You begin the launch sequence.

04:22:20 A launch trajectory is located.

04:22:21 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:22:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:22:41 Which sector did you mean?

04:22:41 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

04:22:42 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:22:42 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:22:43 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:22:46 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:22:48 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:22:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:22:49 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:22:50 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:22:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I better not miss this girl fight."

04:22:51 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:22:53 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:22:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:22:54 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:22:57 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Critical Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:22:58 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

04:22:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:23:01 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:23:05 Your communicator reports that...

04:23:05 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

04:23:06 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "She won't show up."

04:23:22 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:23:22 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:23:23 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 271" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:23:27 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Critical Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:23:27 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:23:37 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:23:42 You pull a large lever towards you.

04:23:42 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:23:43 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:23:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ooooh, You here that Evenia? She's saying you don't have the guts to fight her, you gonna take that?"

04:23:54 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey snickers.

04:24:00 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.

04:24:02 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Airlock]

04:24:02 You can go out and enter into the ship.

04:24:03 You exit the ship.

04:24:03 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

04:24:06 [The Torus; Garage]

04:24:06 You can go up.

04:24:09 I don't understand that.

04:24:12 The five-person pulsar "Critical Strike" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.

04:24:13 [Starship "Supernova"; Airlock]

04:24:13 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

04:24:14 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

04:24:14 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

04:24:15 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, and a fuzzy stuffed bear here.
You can go south and out.

04:24:16 You lie down on an overstuffed black sofa.

04:24:22 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "She'll quit being so all high-and-mighty when I teach her a lesson."

04:24:39 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence yawns.

04:24:45 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I'm shaking."

04:24:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You should be."

04:25:11 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Shaking my fist at you. You just can't see it yet."

04:25:25 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Shake that tiny fist."

04:26:01 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I will tie you up with my hair."

04:26:10 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "So girlie."

04:26:15 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Pathetic."

04:26:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok yeah, see? I definitely don't want to miss this fight."

04:26:51 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Then I'll tie you up with your own hair."

04:27:00 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

04:27:04 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh. That scares the hell out of me. Except not."

04:28:00 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok.. this is starting to sound less and less light a fight."

04:28:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er like."

04:28:31 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "She won't show up anyway."

04:28:35 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'll rip out that hair. And use it to cover your face. When you walk out in shame."

04:28:52 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I don't walk out, they'll have to carry me out."

04:29:01 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Damn right they will."

04:34:39 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Are you planning to put it in a video?"

04:34:43 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nicolette said the gym, but that could be any gym anywhere,  really."

04:34:51 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Even a gym on a ship."

04:35:03 [MTTS] atherj: Goodness, hosts. How long have you had all of this information that you compiled into these new help files?

04:35:17 [MTTS] Ulias: It's glorious.

04:38:48 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli, I shall beat you up at somewhere other than a gym."

04:39:05 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "And you will just stand there idly taking the hits calmly."

04:39:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey it's not me that's fighting. It's some sort of sexy girl fight. If we fight it won't be sexy at all."

04:39:24 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Don't you have robot parts, Ather. Sounds a bit unfair to Eli."

04:39:50 [General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Eli...urmom!"

04:40:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  right. I forgot."

04:40:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You are correct, that was a perfect urmom moment and I let it slip through my fingers."

04:40:28 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I thought you were saying Eli was your mom."

04:44:57 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Hay girls, I don't hear any squeaking."

04:45:28 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "They were talking about hair to hair fight or something."

04:54:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought there was an ctual bookstore in the spaceport now?"

04:54:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "There is, Eli."

04:54:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Might can get them there too."

04:54:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The most recent editions of those might not be available in there though hmm. Space Market might be better."

04:55:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ather might be able to tell you what the latest edition is."

04:55:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I think it is sixth though."

04:56:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's probably urmom edition."

04:57:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Evenia, how could you not have told me that Big Harry's Monkey Waffle House is on Ars Magna."

04:57:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "The latest edition is basically the latest upgrade. I haven't come out with any recent updates, but I plan to soon, probably for both books. However, there will not be a particular edition number; I don't do that anymore, because it's just easier that way. You will just see posts on AEU/trading with any changes I deem worthy to be outlined."

04:58:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] "I don't blame you there Ather." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "Sometimes it seems like scientists invent new upgrades just to spite you."

04:58:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, Ather came out with a new edition of his book? Quick release some new ships and upgrades immeaditely."

04:59:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh Evenia dropped off comms, Nicolette? What did you do with her? Is she all tied up in your hair now?"

05:01:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Bye bye Obliteration."

05:47:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'm going to keep the science vessel databank expansion out of our upgrades book since it's...well, for the science vessel. No one has an issue with this, you say? Fantastic! I am pleased everyone agrees with me, as they should."

06:06:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nicolette, did Evenia ever show up?"

06:07:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not asking for silly reason this time. Just curious since she dropped off comms not long after all that."

06:08:05 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "She said she was going to be taking a nap. She'll be back I'm sure."

06:08:30 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "A nap won't save her."

06:08:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Right on."

06:08:43 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Unless she naps from now on."

06:09:00 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "On that note, I am going to take an eight or twelve hour nap. I will see you all later."

06:09:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hopefully I, too, will not face the wrath of Nicolette when you receive my tacky SSN gift in a couple of days."

06:09:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "With my luck, you'll just end up loving it and the joke will be ruined."

06:35:50 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That was super fast, you practically bounced off the planet."

06:36:14 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "That's how fast my fists are going to bounce off her head."

06:37:06 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I see her beating you up worse than an Outsider PDB hitting Grenwold."

06:37:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You are so pleasant tonight Nicolette."

06:39:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So appearently Eva was supposed to set up 285 before going on that trip."

06:39:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And she did not."

06:39:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah."

06:39:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Evenia said she'd look into it. I'll see if I can't get it up in a bit."

06:39:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess she never got around to checking into it."

06:39:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That was what Eve found out I guess."

06:40:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, right on."

06:45:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You know you can just get the stuff from the supply store and do it right?"

06:45:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No but I shall."

06:47:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just need the hull brush, the weapon grease and the rust-be-gone. You might find that it's a bit theraputic. I used to enjoy doing it myself."

06:47:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's not a combat ship, you don't even need the weapons grease."

06:48:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Its a gunship."

06:48:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, yeah weapons grease then. And the battle mark eraser if you want it, but a lot of folks don't like to use that. They like to keep thier battle marks as badges of honor."

06:49:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So,  that's more of ap erson preference."

06:49:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. a personal preference."

06:55:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "My second, I believe."

06:55:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She was crewing on Shule's Pulsar earlier today."

06:55:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ah cool."

06:55:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did great too."

06:56:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yeah she did pretty awesome on my ship too."

06:56:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thanks guys."

06:56:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I feel like I still get hit too much but with rapids its tough flying."

06:57:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Not only do you have to avoid their locks but also their auto locking assault warps."

07:35:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Were you up for doing that rift trip in a little while? I've another Bari corpse job to finish."

07:35:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sure,  it will be pretty good timing actually."

07:36:02 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

07:58:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Almost done, Eli."

08:08:56 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I really gotta stop ordering stuff from SSN."

08:09:18 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Never. Order all the things."

08:09:26 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hey, there you are."

08:09:40 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I thought Nicolette had you captured in her hair."

08:09:51 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Here I am. Remind me never to nap in a runabout again."

08:10:02 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Stiff neck?"

08:10:29 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah. Not as bad as the times I've napped in a capsule, but still uncomfortable."

08:11:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh hey, I have mail."

08:12:15 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "I just saw you take off."

08:12:22 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Bye bye runabout."

08:12:27 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Yeah, I was still landed over there."

08:12:55 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I love this little ship. I love my capsule, but I can't bring a robot friend with me in that."

08:13:27 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I haven't used mine much since I got my long-ranged sightseer, but yeah, it's a nice little shuttle."

08:13:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm still curious what three of them would do to a tactical platform."

08:14:13 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I can show you a platform with 3 of the other sightseers, but not those ones."

08:14:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Since the interplanetary shuttle seems to do cargo space, I'm wondering if perhaps runabouts would give it speed."

08:14:41 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh I meant the runabout, I know what the sightseers do, for the most part."

08:15:02 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I had 3 tickets laying around. I'd almost try it. For the hell of it."

08:15:31 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You only ned one, really. If you're just testing it you could use mine and yours."

08:16:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn sanitation drone, running off with my water."

08:16:45 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

08:17:05 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh and someon eleft light-green AEU bikini panties on the bar in here. I wonder who that could have been."

08:17:11 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Not me."

08:17:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably Lexie."

08:18:06 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Hey. Maybe Ather's crafting fee, is what covers the awesome packaging you get stuff in."

08:18:21 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "There's packaging?"

08:18:30 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "There is."

08:19:50 [General Communication] "Sanity woman." Evenia an Eachtrannach sighs. "You can not put an asteroid scanner on a gemini. Well I suppose you could, but..."

08:20:01 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs.

08:20:12 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Quiet you."

08:20:17 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This is what happens when you don't get your coffee."

08:20:35 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Too bad 285 is down."

08:20:36 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "It is."

08:20:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "On my way back to new earth now."

08:20:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ok, I'm in the lounge."

08:21:33 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Right? Well...If I shoved this thing in a carrier I could get out there. Hell. the parts for the 285 accelerator are on the seekers fucking constructor, which of course...I can not fly."

08:22:14 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If it's a points issue, I could probably fly it if you have a key. And I'm supposed to take Tara out to see the rift in a minute anyways."

08:22:42 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nah. Because it's an AEU ship, I can't fly it. I'm damn sure I'd have the points."

08:22:52 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do you have a key?"

08:23:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If not, I'm not sure how ot get it up. Not with parts from everybody on it, anyways."

08:23:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I wish. But someone took me to see earlier, because I was curious if the parts were there. I'm sure Morris wouldn't care if I put the thing up, but..."

08:24:53 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Nicolette, you got a key to the seekers constructor?"

08:25:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I do but lets not tell morris."

08:25:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Can I borrow it Vernos?"

08:26:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I don't care, feel kinda screwed by starseekers anyways."

08:26:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well, it will get your station up, and that's what you wanted, right?"

08:27:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Yup."

08:27:45 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I got a hold of one Evenia."

08:27:55 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Did it hurt?"

08:28:09 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I made him scream a bit."

08:28:16 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.

08:28:19 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Why do you need a key to..."

08:28:44 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "For 285 Nicolette. Apparently Eva was supposed to put it up before she left and forgot."

08:28:52 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Because. The 285 accelerator is on there. And...well. I think maybe it might wanna be put up? I just get this feeling..."

08:29:46 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I mean. I'm only trying to help out..."

08:30:24 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I.. Is thre some sort of problem? Iwouldn't have thought it was a big deal."

08:30:41 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Thank you, ma'am."

08:31:49 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Did you get one Eve?"

08:31:59 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Indeed."

08:32:23 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I'll gladly return it to Morris when he returns, but I feel like he'd want me to put this up."

08:32:34 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Probably, yes."

08:32:50 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Bill him when he returns for the labor."

08:33:20 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "If I didn't love building stations so much, I might. But also...I've never got to build aboard a constructor before."

08:33:37 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh,  it's good times. The best part is kicking it out hte back."

08:36:02 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

10:08:46 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey grumbles.

10:23:19 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww, don't show me the House of Wings commercial, they never answer the phone for me anymore."

10:23:47 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "What did you do to get banned?"

10:23:59 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I have no idea why they won't answer the hoen for me."

10:24:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I never did anything."

10:40:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sorry, I had a problem, were you able to respond?"

10:41:21 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "I said it is likely. Are you wearing bug? Could turn up gain knob to make signal louder."

10:41:32 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Is joke."

10:41:36 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

10:41:50 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If not Aisling knows what I wanted to ask you about."

10:42:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That is a tough little ship dude."

10:42:58 [General Communication] Anfisa of Marzore transmits, "Very well."

10:45:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The combat scout?"

10:45:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's pretty brutal. Almost like a minature Pulsar. Just wish it had more grid."

11:03:04 [General Communication] Luja Garland transmits, "I see a few pilots are out of comms. When are they coming back?"

11:03:18 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not sure, they went to Feng Wo."

11:54:13 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

11:54:13 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

11:56:25  You are wearing a short-sleeved oceanside blue linen shirt, a pair of slim Sahara sand linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

11:56:25 You are carrying nothing.

11:56:27 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Lobby]

11:56:27 You can go north, northeast, northwest, and down.

11:56:30 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

11:56:30 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a fuzzy stuffed bear, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.
You can go south and out.

11:56:54 You can't go that way.

11:56:56 [Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]

11:56:56 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

12:06:53 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

12:06:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

You can go south and out.

12:13:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

12:13:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

12:13:28 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

12:13:33 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Critical Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

12:13:33 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

12:13:43 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

12:13:45 Would you like to see a list of possible destinations?

12:13:50 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Gateway. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

12:13:50 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

12:13:53 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Gateway."

12:13:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

12:13:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

12:13:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

12:14:01 Via general sector communication, Resistance Headquarters transmits, "Critical Strike, be advised that the Free Port Doctrine is in effect here."

[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

12:31:52 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

12:31:55 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:32:21 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

12:32:21 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

12:32:26 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Critical Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

12:32:26 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

12:32:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

12:32:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

12:32:39 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

12:32:41 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

12:33:11 Your ship 'Critical Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

12:50:08 [Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]

12:50:08 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark red leather captain's chair, a black leather sofa, and a viral injection pylon launcher here.

On either side of the corridor is a row of tall windows that provides on one side a glimpse of the inner curve of the opposite side of the Torus and, on the other, the sight of the starry black space beyond the station.

A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room.

Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

16:40:17 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

16:40:20 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:40:27 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Ali."

16:40:35 [General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yes?"

16:40:49 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Artifacts and earth, or minral an earth."

16:40:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:40:54 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, a glossy dark violet ceramic felo chow bowl, Prissy the big violet long-haired felo, and Shine the big white glowing felo kitten here.
You can go out.

16:45:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Observation Deck]

16:45:58 You see a large round light purple and dark purple cloth rug, an antique oak table from Old Earth, a textured plasteel floor lamp with a cream shade (casting a white-colored glow), a violet leather sectional sofa, a glossy lilac ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling coral pink-lit aquarium containing light blue and red aquatic life and coral rocks, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

16:45:58 [Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]

16:45:59 You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

16:46:03 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

16:46:04 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a bulky silver-colored posterizer, a black plastic tray of spider chow, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins here.
You can go south and out.

16:46:06 Not much to see out there.

16:46:08 There appear to be about 14 pilots recently active.

16:46:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

16:46:42 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, KitCat the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and an insulated red sleeping bag here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:46:43 You can't go that way.

16:46:46 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

16:46:46 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage. The hatch appears to be locked. A small light near the hatch is dark and unpowered.

You can go out and enter into the ship.

16:46:55 You exit the ship.

16:46:55 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

16:46:58 [The Torus; Garage]

16:46:59 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord.
You can go up.

16:47:02 Board what?

16:47:04 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]

16:47:04 You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

16:47:06 You key in a transport of Firestorm to your location.

16:47:06 The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is slowly brought in aboard an automated flatbed, then lowered to the floor.
[Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

16:47:08 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

16:47:08 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

16:47:25 You peer out...

16:47:25 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

18:24:56 You can't go that way.

18:24:58 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

18:24:58 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

18:40:35 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent.

18:40:51 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

18:40:51 The New Earth spaceport garage is a large contrast to the landing pad above. The large underground room is dark, musty, and crowded with aging starships. A steel stairway leads up.
You can go up.

18:40:57 Go where?

18:40:58 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

18:40:59 Go where?

18:41:33 An orangutan apprehensively licks a spherical security drone and smacks her lips.

18:41:43 [New Earth; Spaceport Repair & Rearm]

18:41:44 A cramped aluminum box hanging over the edge of the pad, this dingy shop serves your ship repair and rearmament needs. A greasy-looking guy stands behind the counter, awaiting your order and smoking a cigarette.
You can go south.

18:41:53 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods down.

18:42:14 An orangutan lopes down.

18:42:15 Use what?

18:42:19 You punch a few commands into your personal credit assistant and receive the following display:

18:42:25 I don't understand that.

18:42:28 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

18:42:28 This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can here.
You can go east, south, and west.

18:42:29 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

18:42:30 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

18:42:49 [New Earth; Xenology Center]

18:42:50 Though you are denied access to the majority of the xenology center, there is plenty here to hold your interest. Dozens of alien artifacts, when not being studied, are placed on display behind clear plasteel. You examine the artificial monopoles and exotic synthetic materials and wonder idly about the species that may have created them.
You can go northeast.

18:42:51 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Live Long And Prosper to AFW Command: MSG Q1 <END>"

18:42:54 Say to whom?

18:42:54 You can't go that way.

18:42:56 You can't go that way.

You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

18:43:03 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]

18:43:04 The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine, a sanitation drone, and a police drone here.
Tracy Parker is asleep.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and out.

18:43:06 [New Earth; Renaming Center]

18:43:06 The renaming center is a quiet room filled with comfortable lounge chairs. A dispenser of renaming forms is available, as well as a computer to feed them into. A sign reminds you to specify to the computer that you wish to RENAME yourself.
You can go northeast.

18:43:12 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]

To the west you see an exit much like the main entrance, but smaller. You can make out a large arch through the doors. A sign pointing east indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a large sign and a police drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, northwest, and out.

18:46:05 [New Earth; Temporary Structures]
This store looks to be fairly new, which would make sense since temporary space structures are a new invention. They can be bought here at what go for reasonable prices for use in space. A middle aged salesperson waits for your order.
You can go north.

18:47:32 The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.

19:03:34 [New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.

19:03:34 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]
The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.

Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that one is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the west you see an exit much like the main entrance, but smaller. You can make out a large arch through the doors. A sign pointing east indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.

19:05:57 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Is anyone ever really trying to be insane? Wait.. don't answer that."

19:05:58 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.

19:06:20 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Some people don't have to try."

19:06:26 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Alko's trying to get a camp together for those who are new to the conversation."

19:06:46 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Can't at the moment."

19:10:16 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:10:37 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:10:38 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:10:50 You peer out...

19:10:50 
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

19:10:53 Your communicator reports that...

19:10:53 
No one is relaxing anywhere in public. Maybe you should!

19:13:02 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:13:02 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:13:03 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

19:13:08 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Flounder, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

19:13:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:13:17 The ship is already moving.

19:13:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:13:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

19:13:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:13:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:13:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

19:16:41 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

19:16:43 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:16:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:16:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:16:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:16:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:16:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:16:54 The ship is already moving.

19:16:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:17:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:17:03 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Starship Museum. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:17:03 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:17:04 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

19:17:06 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

19:17:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:17:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:17:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:17:11 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:17:11 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Shipyards."

19:17:11 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

19:17:12 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:17:14 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:17:15 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:17:15 The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and darkened, and the ISC is no more.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:17:16 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a carbonaceous chondrite asteroid.

19:17:16 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Starship Museum."

19:17:17 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:45:23 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

19:45:28 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk of gold.

20:01:14 [Starship "Flounder"; Airlock]

20:01:14 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here.  The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.  The hatch appears to be locked.
You can go out and into the ship.

20:01:15 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water. Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the Spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Hauler3", the one-person cargo hauler "The Harvina", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 584", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 45", the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Monster", the one-person cargo hauler "Sexy", the eight-person journeyer "Blueberry", and the one-person flitter "Flounder" are landed here.

You can go north, west, and down.
The one-person flitter "Flounder" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

20:01:16 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

20:01:17 This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.
You can go east, south, and west.

20:01:17 [New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

20:01:17 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]

20:01:17 The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine and a sanitation drone here.
Tracy Parker is asleep.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and out.

20:01:20 [New Earth; FTL Communications]

20:01:21 You maneuver past a display of metachannel FTL communicators and make your way to a large counter. Nearby racks hold boxes of communicators available for purchase.

20:04:49 I don't understand that.

20:04:56 You must launch before using the FTL drive.

20:04:59 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:05:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Flounder, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:05:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:05:14 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:05:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

20:05:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:05:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:05:30 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:11:35 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here.  The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.  The hatch appears to be locked.
You can go out and into the ship.

20:11:35 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water. Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the Spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Hauler3", the one-person cargo hauler "The Harvina", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 584", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 45", the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Monster", the one-person cargo hauler "Sexy", the eight-person journeyer "Blueberry", and the one-person flitter "Flounder" are landed here.

20:11:37 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

20:11:37 This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.
You can go east, south, and west.

20:11:39 You can't go that way.

20:11:40 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:11:40 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

20:11:41 [New Earth; Supply Store]

20:11:41 Racks and shelves line the walls of this shop. All the wares a healthy ship requires can be bought here for what pass for reasonable prices. A tired looking teenager is slumped behind the counter, resting his face on the sales counter as he awaits the intrusion of a customer.
You see a message drone here.
You can go south.

20:12:25 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:12:25 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can, a sanitation drone, a sanitation drone, and a police drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

20:12:26 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

20:12:26 This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can here.
You can go east, south, and west.

20:12:27 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water. Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the Spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Hauler3", the one-person cargo hauler "The Harvina", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 584", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 45", the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Monster", the one-person cargo hauler "Sexy", and the eight-person journeyer "Blueberry" are landed here.

20:12:30 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

20:12:30 The New Earth spaceport garage is a large contrast to the landing pad above. The large underground room is dark, musty, and crowded with aging starships. A steel stairway leads up.
You can go up.

20:12:31 Board what?

20:12:34 The one-person flitter "Flounder" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved to the launching area.

20:12:39 Some lights on the one-person flitter "Flounder" suddenly flash several times.

20:12:39 [Starship "Flounder"; Airlock]
You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here.  The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.  The hatch appears to be unlocked.

You can go down and out.

20:27:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:27:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:27:10 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:27:15 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Flounder, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:27:15 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:27:25 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:27:29 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

20:27:30 The ship is already moving.

20:27:34 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:27:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:28:46 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

20:28:48 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:28:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "MOrris' goofy book Ather."

20:29:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh. I didn't even bother reading that thing."

20:29:30 I don't understand that.

20:29:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well no, I might've, but I most likely just quickly disregarded it."

20:29:35 I don't understand that.

20:29:40 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:29:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "What every pilot doesn't need to know, irrelvant answers to relevant questions."

20:29:53 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

20:29:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah, sounds pretty morris-like."

20:29:58 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

20:30:03 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be some stray nebular matter.

20:30:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Saira transmits after a pause, "So basically every one."

20:30:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it's not the most useful book,  for sure. But there was a few things in there that I thought weren't too bad. The infromation on rift stuff, the cyclical timescale stuff."

20:34:57 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:34:59 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

20:35:01 I don't understand that.

20:35:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Three Pirates in belt of orion. A skirmish with the peace keepers!"

20:35:03 There are no other ships in this sector.

20:35:04 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

20:35:06 I don't understand that.

20:35:08 I don't understand that.

20:35:09 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball of frozen hydrogen.

20:35:10 There are no other ships in this sector.

20:35:21 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:35:21 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:35:23 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

20:35:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

20:35:28 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:35:30 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Live Long And Prosper."

20:35:33 The ship is already moving.

20:35:37 The ship is already moving.

20:35:38 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:35:39 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:35:40 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:35:40 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

20:35:43 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:35:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:35:45 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

20:35:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:35:47 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: qq:]=`N<K,]'[Mo]cz5'4o^on"ZW_&C)zB'M2]3}
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:35:48 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

20:35:51 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:35:52 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:35:52 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:35:53 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

20:35:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:35:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'll scare them off."

20:35:56 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:35:57 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:35:57 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:35:58 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

20:35:59 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:36:06 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:36:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Checking it out."

20:36:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:41:01 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

20:41:01 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

20:41:02 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

20:41:05 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:41:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:41:08 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:41:08 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

20:48:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

20:48:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.

20:48:52 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

20:49:08 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'thirty minutes.'"

20:49:28 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

20:49:28 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

20:49:29 You notify flight control of your desire to launch.

20:49:34 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Flounder, you have clearance to launch.  Good luck and come back to us safe."

20:49:34 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

20:49:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

20:49:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as the FTL drive opens a wormhole.

20:49:53 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

20:49:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

20:49:59 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

20:50:05 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Debris.

20:50:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

20:50:10 You are wearing a standard grey shipsuit.  Under that, you are wearing some briefs.  You have on a pair of shiny black boots.  You are also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a small cloth sack, and a metachannel FTL communicator.

20:50:10 You are carrying nothing.

20:50:13 [Starship "Flounder"; Airlock]

20:50:13 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here.  Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.  The hatch appears to be locked.
You can go into the ship.

20:50:15 [Starship "Flounder"; Control Room]

20:50:15 Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You can go down and out.

20:50:17 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Live Long And Prosper."

20:50:43 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:50:45 You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.

20:50:50 A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and slowly brought into the ship's hold.

20:50:55 The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be an asteroid containing rock-eating microbes.

20:55:09 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

20:55:09 Would you like to request landing clearance at New Earth?
[Enter `yes' or `no']

20:55:12 You notify flight control of your desire to land.

20:55:17 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Flounder.  We read your AEU transponder.  You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

20:55:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

20:55:27 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

20:55:29 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Greetings."

20:55:30 Storage hold contents:

20:55:30

20:55:34 You hear metallic scraping as the transfer of the cargo begins.

20:55:39 The sounds from the ship's hold cease as the cargo finishes transferring.

20:55:40 You have been credited with 94826.88 AEU credits for your find.

20:55:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "He speaks! Hello!"

20:56:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I've been rather to myself, is all."

20:56:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I think we all do that now 'n then. Its a pilot thing."

20:57:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hi Constantine."

20:57:24 You pull a large lever towards you.

20:57:24 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

20:57:30 [Starship "Flounder"; Airlock]

20:57:30 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here.  The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.  The hatch appears to be locked.
You can go out and into the ship.

20:57:38 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water. Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the Spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Hauler3", the one-person cargo hauler "The Harvina", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 584", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 45", the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Monster", the one-person cargo hauler "Sexy", the eight-person journeyer "Blueberry", and the one-person flitter "Flounder" are landed here.

You can go north, west, and down.
The one-person flitter "Flounder" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

20:57:40 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

20:57:41 This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.
You can go east, south, and west.

20:57:42 A police drone enters the area and begins scanning.

20:57:46 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:57:46 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

20:57:48 [New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room]

20:57:48 Clean and metallic, this room speaks of efficiency and haste. People wander in and deliver or pick up mail, as workers take or hand it out. Boxes line the walls, marked with serial numbers that designate the owner.
You can go north and down.

20:57:52 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:57:52 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes.

You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

20:57:53 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]

20:57:54 The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine and a sanitation drone here.
Tracy Parker is asleep.

You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

20:58:02 [New Earth; Trading Center]

20:58:02 The trading center seems to be one of the busiest places in the spaceport. Which is not surprising, considering the profits that successful trading can bring in. Avoiding the automated computer terminals used by the career traders, you decide to approach a human trade clerk. This, incidentally, will also subject your purchases and sales to less scrutiny.
You can go southwest.

20:58:05 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:58:05 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes.

20:58:05 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

20:58:06 [New Earth; Supply Store]

20:58:06 Racks and shelves line the walls of this shop. All the wares a healthy ship requires can be bought here for what pass for reasonable prices. A tired looking teenager is slumped behind the counter, resting his face on the sales counter as he awaits the intrusion of a customer.
You see a message drone here.
You can go south.

20:58:08 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:58:09 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes.

20:58:09 [New Earth; Spaceport Security]

20:58:10 The spaceport security office is a place of sterile plasteel walls, with a large desk to the side and a few holding cells in the back. A group of security officers stands around a dessicated box of donuts. They glance in your direction as you enter, before resuming their idle conversation.
You can go southeast.

20:58:12 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:58:13 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes.

20:58:14 [New Earth; Xenology Center]

20:58:14 Though you are denied access to the majority of the xenology center, there is plenty here to hold your interest. Dozens of alien artifacts, when not being studied, are placed on display behind clear plasteel. You examine the artificial monopoles and exotic synthetic materials and wonder idly about the species that may have created them.
You can go northeast.

20:58:16 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

20:58:16 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes.

20:58:18 [New Earth; HyperTea]

20:58:18 Welcome to HyperTea, another exciting moment in the history of tea. All HyperTea locations are hyperspatially linked, allowing you to interact with people and objects regardless of what HyperTea they're in.
From other locations, you see a song entitled "An Ode To Hotpants", a useless fact generator, a "Ways To Annoy Your Roomate" contraption, a small tray, a chromium jukebox, a page of Lucky trivia, an ocean full of tea, a comfortable lounge chair, a floatable type raft in this sea of tea, a floating elk, a little white magnet that says 'they', a pit of mud, and a box of squirrels here.
You see a group of sleeping people here.
Jennifer Parker is asleep in other locations.
You can go southwest.

20:59:16 You smile.

20:59:26 You say to Lileah Rose, "Hello"

20:59:40 Lileah Rose

20:59:40 She seems to be a member of the AEU.

She is uninjured.
For a top, she is wearing a Thunder Cats t-shirt over a lace bra.  For a bottom, she is wearing a pair of flared faded denim jeans over a pair of skimpy pink lace bikini cut panties.  She is also wearing a diamond choker, a chrome-banded wrist watch with the emerald green emblem of the AEU on the face, a small cloth sack, a Jinu translator, a handbag, a standard starship flightbag, a leather rifle sling, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, a metafrequency FTL transmitter, a personal filing computer, a handwoven shoulder bag, a glittery camera with a flower strap, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a shimmering crystal bracelet, and a diamond tennis bracelet.

21:06:30 You say, "Not yet."

21:06:36 Lileah Rose says, "ok let's see what we can find"

21:06:39 You follow Lileah Rose south.

21:06:39 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]
The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine, a sanitation drone, and a sanitation drone here.
Tracy Parker is asleep.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and out.

21:06:40 You grin.

21:06:40 You follow Lileah Rose west.

21:06:41 [New Earth; Spaceport West]
The western wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of shops and stores. One that is blatantly apparent is the local Ship Shop, which retails spacecraft. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that one is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the west you see an exit much like the main entrance, but smaller. You can make out a large arch through the doors. A sign pointing east indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a large sign and a sanitation drone here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, northwest, and out.

21:06:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Pirate transport in the belt of orion. They're salvaging."

21:06:45 You follow Lileah Rose out.

21:06:45 [New Phoenix; West Arch]
Done in the same style its bigger brother, the Ocean Arch, the West Arch provides citizens with a second exit from the spaceport. Its large sandstone expanse bridges the start of Canada Street, which stretches away to the west. East lies the smaller side entrance to the Spaceport, popular with locals who know better than tourists about the crowds at the front entrance.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go east and west.

21:06:48 You follow Lileah Rose west.

21:06:49 [New Phoenix; Soviet Trail and Canada Street]
The quiet residential/shopping Canada Street is intersected here by the much larger Soviet Trail, which ends. Pedestrian traffic is light, as most of your surroundings are quiet residential buildings and homes. North, down Soviet Trail, you can see busier areas, but you enjoy the momentary calm. Lush green trees line the street, forming a tunnel of sorts over it. The shade gives respite to all kinds of local birds and wildlife, which congregate in them.
You see a large notice and a sanitation drone here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go north, east, and west.

21:06:54 You follow Lileah Rose north.

21:06:54 [New Phoenix; Soviet Trail]
Around you, Soviet Trail slowly begins its transition from the quiet residences of Canada Street to the industry of the area to the north. The road broadens to the north and buildings become taller and more packed together. Grayness overtakes the landscape. For now, however, nice commerical shops reign. East of here you see the suborbital pod to Landfall.
You see a sanitation drone here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go north, northeast, east, and south.

21:07:00 You follow Lileah Rose north.

21:07:00 [New Phoenix; Soviet Trail]
Buildings grey and air thickens as you approach the industrial heart of the city. Large cargo vehicles become more plentiful, in addition to other industrial-style accents.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go north and south.

21:07:04 You follow Lileah Rose north.

21:07:04 [New Phoenix; American Avenue, China Road, and Soviet Trail]
On the northeast corner of this intersection lies a huge open-air market, which spreads away to the east. Wares of all kinds are sold here, and personal commerce is welcome. To the north and south, Soviet Trail stretches, to the north with warehouses and factories, and to the south with wholesale stores and small businesses. American Avenue runs diagonally to the Trail, continuing to offer its variated shops, homes, and other businesses.
You see a trash can here.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go east, southeast, and south.

21:07:06 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Thanos". The organization has earned 241,387.91 credits.

21:07:23 You follow Lileah Rose east.

21:07:23 [New Phoenix; China Road]
The city's huge open-air market is spread out before you to the north. Looking to the west, you can see that it continues on to the intersection of this road and Soviet Trail. Commuters who prefer exercise ride by you on bicycles, weaving expertly between pedestrians and carts. To the southern side of the street, a large sign announces the store Totes n' Stuff.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go east and west.

21:07:26 You follow Lileah Rose west.

21:08:01 You follow Lileah Rose into Totes n' Stuff; Showroom.

21:08:01 [Totes n' Stuff; Showroom]
Various types of luggage are displayed on racks all around the floor. You are at first disturbed by the lack of price tags on items, but soon notice a menu on the wide counter at the back of the store.
Lileah Rose is here.
You can go out.

21:08:30 Lileah Rose says, "no big"

21:08:32 You put on a backpack.

21:08:36 Lileah Rose drops a backpack.

21:08:45 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:08:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:08:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:08:53 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

21:08:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

21:09:01 The ship is already moving.

21:09:03 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:09:04 Which sector did you mean?

21:09:04

The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 294" has docked with The Torus (Dock Alpha).

21:09:06 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to The Belt Of Orion. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:09:07 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:09:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Artifacts."

21:09:08 [General Communication] A Jinu transmits, "Yuuijuminlakiltra ss bruyo jukl human wuharel oh 'ten minutes.'"

21:09:10 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:09:12 Lileah Rose asks, "anything else?"

21:09:12 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:09:13 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:09:14 A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following: 883~?<KtO/^L{AfZSkx~Q&.X)AqS_oeWeBo}Z0%^
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:09:14 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Green Belt Formation."

21:09:15 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:09:17 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:09:18 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:09:18 This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space stations of unknown origin.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:09:19 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Muttering Deeps."

21:09:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:09:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:09:23 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

21:09:23 The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a source.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:09:24 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Belt of Orion."

When referring to objects, while putting stuff away, removing stuff, etc., you will probably encounter times where you're not getting the right object, because more than one matches what you're typing.

To get around this, you may refer to objects as the following:
thing
other thing
third thing
fourth thing
fifth thing
etc.

If something ever says 'ambiguous' or 'failed' match, please notify a host.

Teleoperated Mining

Teleoperated mining consists of controlling a mining drone from a remote location, using it to drill into asteroids to find precious materials.  It provides a way to make money without having to use a ship.  The startup prices are rather expensive, however.

Starting Out:
First, locate a teleoperated mining center.  There is one present on each capital.  The first room you enter is the store.  Before you may do anything, you must REGISTER and receive a card.  (You may later UNREGISTER, though it is not necessary and you will lose everything.)  Then check out the MENU.  You will need to purchase the following:
	-a mining drone
	-a sensor system
	-some drill bits

Mining Drone:
While very expensive, you will only ever need to buy one drone.

Sensors:
As expected, the more expensive sensor systems are better.  Better sensor systems enable drone to find mining sites more easily.  This means it can find closer sites, reducing drone travel time.

Drill Bits:
The more expensive drill bits are stronger.  The stronger a drill bit, the more material it is able to locate at a mining site.  This means less travelling to new sites.

Controlling the Drone:
Go into the next room, which is the control room.  Card in hand, type START.  You will be presented with a menu.  From this point on, you can type MENU to see your current options.  Activate the drone, and then l
21:28:03 oad it with bits.  It can only hold four at a time.  Send it to a new location, and then begin drilling.  If a bit breaks, fit it with a new one.  If your drone can't find any more material at a location, move to another.  And finally, if your storage fills up, return to base and transfer.  When this is done, you may go back to the first room and type PAYMENT for your money.

21:28:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, I don't imagine that someone who is willing to make sure a law which is not even of his own alliance is upheld over protecting a harmless human faction would be willing to agree with most of my standings, but there we are."

21:28:18 Lileah Rose laughs.

21:28:40 Lileah Rose asks, "well did you get a drone and drill bits and the best sensor you can get?"

21:28:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ather, I can not comment on that at this time."

21:28:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa chuckles.

21:28:53 Lileah Rose says, "I wouldn't buy the most expensive bits to start"

Teleoperated Mining

Teleoperated mining consists of controlling a mining drone from a remote location, using it to drill into asteroids to find precious materials.  It provides a way to make money without having to use a ship.  The startup prices are rather expensive, however.

Starting Out:
First, locate a teleoperated mining center.  There is one present on each capital.  The first room you enter is the store.  Before you may do anything, you must REGISTER and receive a card.  (You may later UNREGISTER, though it is not necessary and you will lose everything.)  Then check out the MENU.  You will need to purchase the following:
	-a mining drone
	-a sensor system
	-some drill bits

Mining Drone:
While very expensive, you will only ever need to buy one drone.

Sensors:
As expected, the more expensive sensor systems are better.  Better sensor systems enable drone to find mining sites more easily.  This means it can find closer sites, reducing drone travel time.

Drill Bits:
The more expensive drill bits are stronger.  The stronger a drill bit, the more material it is able to locate at a mining site.  This means less travelling to new sites.

Controlling the Drone:
Go into the next room, which is the control room.  Card in hand, type START.  You will be presented with a menu.  From this point on, you can type MENU to see your current options.  Activate the drone, and then l
21:35:18 oad it with bits.  It can only hold four at a time.  Send it to a new location, and then begin drilling.  If a bit breaks, fit it with a new one.  If your drone can't find any more material at a location, move to another.  And finally, if your storage fills up, return to base and transfer.  When this is done, you may go back to the first room and type PAYMENT for your money.

21:35:20 Your drone has mined one unit of material, for a total of two stored.

21:35:44 Your drone has mined one unit of material, for a total of three stored.

22:11:31 I don't understand that.

22:11:32 [New Earth; Teleoperated Mining Drones]

22:11:33 This store has a long white counter against one wall, upon which sits an automated clerk. Posters show mining drones moving along the surface of various asteroids, some of them with drills extended down into the surface. A small model of a mining drone is placed upon a podium in the center of the room.
You see a message drone here.
You can go north and southeast.

22:11:35 You receive the 5050000.00 AEU credits stored on your card.

22:11:39 You can't go that way.

22:11:41 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]

22:11:41 The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine and a police drone here.
Tracy Parker is asleep.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and out.

22:11:42 A police drone turns and goes southwest.

22:11:44 [New Earth; Spaceport East]

22:11:44 The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

22:11:46 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

22:11:46 This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can here.
You can go east, south, and west.

22:11:47 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The Spaceport of New Earth's capital city stands over a breathtaking crystal clear bay which lies at the tip of the southern continent. The Landing Pad itself is a huge, square sheet of plasteel, suspended by pillars over the water. Ships surround you, and the bustle of daily business overwhelms your senses. To the west you can see a bridge spanning the gap to the main building of the Spaceport.
The one-person cargo hauler "Hauler3", the one-person cargo hauler "The Harvina", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 584", the one-person supply shuttle "Unreality Programming 45", the one-person cargo hauler "Debris Monster", the one-person cargo hauler "Sexy", and the eight-person journeyer "Blueberry" are landed here.

22:11:52 An orangutan pulls a small lever on an acclimated vegetation dispenser, and a batch of soft leaves falls to the ground.

22:11:52 An orangutan grabs a batch of soft leaves from the ground, and stuffs it in her mouth.

22:11:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, getting all those parts together was a huge pain."

22:12:01 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

22:12:01 The New Earth spaceport garage is a large contrast to the landing pad above. The large underground room is dark, musty, and crowded with aging starships. A steel stairway leads up.
You can go up.

22:12:03 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But building everything was easy."

22:12:05 I don't understand that.

22:12:13 Some lights on the eight-person journeyer "Blueberry" suddenly flash several times.

22:12:13 [Starship "Blueberry"; Airlock]
You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here.  The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.  Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.  The hatch appears to be unlocked.
You see a spherical security drone and a shiny blue medical drone here.

22:14:42 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

22:14:42 The New Earth spaceport garage is a large contrast to the landing pad above. The large underground room is dark, musty, and crowded with aging starships. A steel stairway leads up.
You can go up.

22:14:45 The eight-person journeyer "Blueberry" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved to the launching area.

22:14:47 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

22:14:48 This walkway bridge spans the gap between the Spaceport proper and its Landing Pad. Hundreds of feet below you the crystal waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. Gulls and other imported species fly about and call out to each other far offshore. To the west you can see the entry to the Spaceport's Main Building. Some recent construction appears to be complete to the south. East is the Landing Pad.
You see a trash can here.
You can go east, south, and west.

22:14:48 [New Earth; Spaceport East]
The eastern wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of side shops and cafes. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that he is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the east you can see people crossing the Spaceport's bridge to and from the Landing Pad. A sign pointing west indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a trash can and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, and northwest.

22:14:48 [New Earth; Spaceport Central]

22:14:48 The east and west wings of the spaceport empty into this cavernous space, which is topped with a clear dome of plasteel. From this angle, it looks no different than real glass. Benches and chairs ring a conical aquarium that takes up much of the center of the room. Tropical fish of all varieties swim in the sparkling seawater. To the north you see the Spaceport's main exit, nearly as wide as this room. A dozen doors swing open and shut as people pass through. Nearly hidden on the far wall, a dim neon sign signals the entrance to the Spaceport Cantina, the local watering hole. A brightly-lit bookstore is also present.
You see an automatic teller machine, a sanitation drone, and a police drone here.
Tracy Parker is asleep.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, west, northwest, up, down, and out.

22:14:49 [New Earth; Spaceport West]
The western wing of New Phoenix's Spaceport, this immense hall is full of shops and stores. One that is blatantly apparent is the local Ship Shop, which retails spacecraft. Benches are spaced periodically, but the general impression one gets is that one is not meant to linger. The walls are smooth, silver plasteel, nearly chrome-like in its reflectiveness. To the west you see an exit much like the main entrance, but smaller. You can make out a large arch through the doors. A sign pointing east indicates that the Central area of the Spaceport lies in that direction.
You see a large sign, a police drone, and a sanitation drone here.
You can go north, northeast, east, southeast, south, southwest, northwest, and out.

22:14:53 [New Earth; Projections]

22:39:06 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

22:39:06 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Help on: Communicators
----------------------
Two-Way FTL Communicators

Two-way FTL communicators allow two players to communicate from anywhere.  They are sold in pairs.

To use them:
USE <communicator name> WITH <message>.

Metachannel FTL Communicators

Metachannel FTL communicators allow any number of players to communicate simultaneously.  There are two options available:  general communication, which includes every player, and communication among your alliance.
NO CHANNEL ANYWHERE IS DESIGNED TO BE AN OUT OF CHARACTER CHANNEL. REMAIN IN CHARACTER ON ALL COMM CHANNELS AT ALL TIMES.

To use a metachannel FTL communicator:
TURN <communicator name> turns your communicator off and on.

   General:
    GENERAL <communicator name> turns general communication for you off and on.
 TRANSMIT GENERAL <message> will send your message over general communication.

   Alliance:
       Your alliance communication is on whenever your comm is.
    There are two alliance channel modes:  single and tuner.
    TUNE <communicator name> TO <channel number>.  Valid channels are 1 to 10, and 0 for tuner.
             Single-channel:
             TRANSMIT  <message> will transmit on the channel your communicator is tuned to.
           Tuner:
              TRANSMIT <channel number> <message> will transmit on the channel you specify.

Metafrequency FTL Transmitters

An FTL transmitter allows a group of any number 
23:02:11 of players to maintain personal radio contact with one another, regardless of alliance, via a previously decided upon frequency.

To use a metafrequency FTL transmitter:
TURN TRANSMITTER ON/TURN TRANSMITTER OFF turns the power on and off, accordingly.

TUNE TRANSMITTER TO <frequency> will tune the transmitter to the desired frequency.  The range of valid transmitter frequencies is currently 1.01 to 599.99.

USE TRANSMITTER WITH <message> transmits your message to every transmitter tuned to the same frequency as you.

CHECK TRANSMITTER tells you what frequency your transmitter is tuned to.

Finally, metafrequency transmitters also offer an earpiece option, for discreet listening.  To utilize an earpiece, simply ATTACH it to the transmitter.  While the transmitter is on your person and supports an earpiece, all messages from the transmitter will be relayed to you only.  When you are done using an earpiece, DETACH it from the metafrequency FTL transmitter.
