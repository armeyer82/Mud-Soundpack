Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.

She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.

mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit and a pair of mystic purple
suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet
around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her
wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved
with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst
crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic
gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft
fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes,
both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

[Starship "RockIt!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
|kR1yd|zV)\ii<a~o<&yYr?-+cQ=+H-3:Ymu4z>*
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through
the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke
clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds
of battle.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer
bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring
engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple
amethyst crystals, and an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire
diamond. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back, both
biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, waist,
both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and both
feet are left uncovered.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Greetings pilots. The last few days have seen very little space combat activity

which fighter has destroyed the most outsider, battle thrall, and allied pirate

winners will receive a cash prize. I will also make a board post about it. Let's
all participate and good luck to those who do.

AEU Solo Combat Fighter Challenge
Enter the body of your post.
[Type lines of input; use `.' to end or `@abort' to abort the command.]
Attention AEU pilots,
It's time to improve our space combat skills, especially solo combat in a
fighter. Starting at midnight on July 17, the Space Defense office will be
holding a contest to see how many outsider, battle thrall, IFS, and allied
pirate ships can be destroyed by a single fighter in eight days. The top three
winners will receive a cash prize! Here are the rules!
1. Only outsider, outsider, battle thrall, and allied pirate ships will count
towards the number of ships destroyed.
2. You may only use an AEU, short-term rented, or long-term rented fighter-class
ship. Otherwise, I will not see it on my reports.
3. RATS and bari spreaders do not count.
4. If you plan to participate, but rent a ship from out at Tannhausser Gate or
rent an org ship, please send me via mail the name of the ship you used and the
approximate time you finished your combat so that I may credit destroyed ships
to the correct pilot.
5. Only qualifying ships destroyed during the contest period will count.
When will this contest take place? From midnight on July 17, until 2359 on July
24.
Prizes:
First place: 50 million credits
Second place: 35 million credits
Third place: 20 million credits
If you have questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to get in touch with
me. Good luck!

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
You can go south and out.

[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been
received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Rest Station from the two-person
medium transport "Words Of Wisdom". The organization has earned 692,763.29
credits.
The starship has entered a unique area of space.

transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor

when he is back?"

[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, that's a good
point."
[0m[Miriani] [General Communication] Ryan Salvatore transmits, "Hello. Is there
anything I can assist with?"[0m
[General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Check the damage grid ratio."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Constantine, remember
the AEU has a special bonus on AEU combat ships which other alliances do not.
Also, if you have most likely 3 or more lasers per room in a combat ship, you
want the Crystaline lasers but for ships like Mules, transports and the like
where you have 1 or 2 lasers, you want more damage so the Heavy lasers are
pretty well-suited for those."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't know
if it might be worth using the lasers with 10 or 8% hull bonuses on ships with
6+ turrets."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Obviously, in combat
you wat the fastest lasers with the most damage effect so yes there is a balance
issue but I think you can see where i'm going with this."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But pretty much
everyone uses the crystalline optics one on combat ships?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "And of course the
other alliances tend to use chainguns which I don't like at all as I don't care
for being non-energy dependent. However, the EAOS Torpedo Launcher is pretty
good and it's an ok replacement for minis unless you simply don't have enough
cargo space for ammunition."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been using
torpedos exclusively, but only because I can't buy minicannons yet."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I assume
torpedos are also much easier on a fighter's tiny grid."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "That's ok but where
you have an option for lasers, use the fastest ones with the most damage that
you can."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I mean I use
torpedos for my launchers, I use the lasers whenever I can in combat."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Good as launchers
aren't that fast as you know."

kept track. I just bought them when they were available hehe."

I bought were around 17,800 industry but I don't know how accurate that is and
those were likely the last part I'll see."

industry do you have?"

You will manage quite well."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like
the simulator can't put out more then 3 drones at a time."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Did you go to the
advanced one?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think my
biggest problem on the high beacons is bumping into other ships when I try to
move, and getting hit."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hmm I thought you
could put more drones than three in there but glad you found it. It's been
awhile since I've been in there and I need the practice. Sure wish we could
simulate them with there being warpers in there too."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think I can
do it if I try again. I might wait until we have the frontier open though."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "My insurance is
getting expensive."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Flying is something I
started out really enjoying but I don't as much as I once did or I'd be cruiser
qualified by now so that is my biggest weakness as a pilot."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "We will have 1000
Command probably by sometime next month so at that point, we'll have a slot to
support another Cruiser so it will be there for yours!"

enjoy what we can."
Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away
from her.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.

You nod.
Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.
Lily Kaise kisses you.

You kiss Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 180.0, 0.0.
Lily Kaise flips a number of failsafe switches on the rift drive control board,
then pushes a heavy lever forward.
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship
bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass,
sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along
a forest floor by a procession of black ants.
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
The ship jerks slightly as the ant carrying it turns abruptly to avoid marching
over a stone.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 165.0, 2.0.
Lily Kaise says, "Heh ants."
Lily Kaise laughs.
'The ants go marching one by one.
You say, "The ants go marching one by one."
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 0.0, 0.0.
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over
an overturned tree.
Lily Kaise says, "Wow we missed it again this is screwy."
Lily Kaise turns a small dial on the rift drive control board, trimming the
riftsail to 50%.
The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over
an overturned tree.
Lily Kaise quickly turns a small wheel on the rift drive control board.
A number flap display rapidly flips around to show a new heading of 0.0, -1.0.
#Miriani
The starship has entered a unique area of space.
This area of space seems largely clear and empty, but the ship's computer is
detecting hints of tightbeam transmissions no longer in alignment. The
transmissions have the regularity of automated machinespeak.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
Lily Kaise resets the starship's mileage meter.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily
Kaise's shoulder.
Lily Kaise makes a selection on the AutoVector control board.
Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it
for a moment.
Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on red alert. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor

trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a compact
purple microwave oven, a Tardick lizard named Asteria, a League Paladin, and an
AEU Combat Universalist here.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

[Starship "Seventh Star"; Control Room] (inside a battlesuit)
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

You see a wormhole drive tracer, a large purple and lavender paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a large white and turquoise paisley floor
pillow with thick silver fringe, a small seashell pink trash can, a shiny round
deep sapphire blue table with a painted tablecloth of intertwined sugar maple
trees, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated cooler, a compact
purple microwave oven, a League Paladin, an AEU Combat Universalist, and a
Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go up and out.
Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

The control room is rapidly cleared of abandoned battlesuits.

Lily Kaise begins the launch sequence.
Lily Kaise says, "Sad times."
Lily Kaise laughs.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that
bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed
with bright white floodlights.
[0m#SESSION 'StarConquest' ACTIVATED.[0m
New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored
in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation
order is entered."
Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Seventh
Star! Welcome to home space!"
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.
The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Seventh Star. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
Lily Kaise asks, "Want to go on over to Tesla?"
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.
'After I check the office, sure.
You say, "After I check the office, sure."
Lily Kaise says, "Ok good plan."
Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.
The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away,
leaving you in a dim silence.

You peer up...
[Starship "Seventh Star"; Weapons Room]
Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Starseekers &
Troubleshooters", a luxuriously soft oval deep sapphire blue rug with a gold
fleur-de-lys in the center and thick gold fringe, and a white four poster rattan
bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft
periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle
bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle
bed pillow on it here.

He appears to be 22 years old. He is about six feet and zero inches tall and has
fair skin. His body is slightly muscled with muscled hips and strong calves. He
has average-sized shoulders and a wide chest. His face is square and somewhat
handsome, with an average nose and dimpled chin. His lips are average and
light-colored and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a
set of expressive eyebrows, his eyes are blue-grey and round. His close-cropped,
bristly hair is dark blonde and neatly combed. He also has a short dark blonde
neatly trimmed beard. He has neatly trimmed pale fingernails.
 He is wearing a standard grey shipsuit and a pair of shiny black boots. He is
also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator,
an orange metachannel FTL communicator, and a small cloth sack. His head, face,
both eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
He is carrying nothing.

This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside,
with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows
overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great view of the landing pad at the
other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables,
and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that
zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast
flickers across the surface of each sleek white table to keep the pilots
informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has
its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey Constantine. We
both can't stay awake until the current asteroid processor goesoffline so we'll
go ahead and deploy it. We'll catch you on the next one and on other stations
though."

Lily Kaise presses a button to cancel the current autopilot program.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: AFW Command (Dock
Four).
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
:;H`IJTz)MMc#K'#;*1^FU87Vq1%6m:E%WF(DWzy
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
Via general sector communication, Beacon E-02 transmits in a robotic voice,
"Detecting vessel 'Herding Cats.' Welcome to The Belt of Orion."
Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.
Lily Kaise transfers a toll payment to a local rift accelerator.

Solar Toll Station in The Belt of Orion.
The computer announces, "Setting course to Asteroid Beacon Alpha 285. Local rift
accelerator with matching vector found."
Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

Date November 9, 2316
Hello Kim,
Shule and I are following in the convoy to Andy's which leaves tomorrow at 0200.
At this time, we don't plan to return with Johann and Sean as we want to go to
an artifacting field near Tom Town called Sea of Fears. SEAS has nearly 1500
Exploration so we'll each artifact to add to that balance.
While we're away, as of this date and according to the Range Office, the
Asteroid Processing station in Alpha 285 will go offline in just under 5 days
and the Salvaging Station will go offline in about 9 days. I know we won't be
back before the Asteroid Processing station goes offline and may not have
returned to deploy the replacement Salvaging station.
We'd really appreciate your assistance with deploying the replacement stations.
I have built both stations aboard Herding Cats, my constructor so all that needs
to be done is to fly the constructor out to Alpha 285 and to deploy each station
when needed. I have enclosed a key to Herding Cats for you to use for this
purpose.
Thanks for your assistance and we'll be more than happy to return a similar
favor when needed.
Regards,
Lily Kaise

During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived
at Famous Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long
time since we drifted off course en route and it required about
another day to get our bearings and to correct our course. When
melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would likely want
to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back
in Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to
prepare a written statement as well albeit I didn't ask permission
to do so but I really wasn't given the time to ask very many
questions.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda into the Control Room of the ship and the
exchange began like this. I asked? 'so Melinda do you have a
letter from Nissi?
Melinda Michaels says. "I do not, she is, um, unavailable."
Melinda then says, "So we are running without either voice
currently."
I nodd to Melinda.
I then asked Melinda? 'so who did she appoint to act on her
behalf?
"She did not appoint anybody," Melinda says. "I took it upon myself
to come out here and make sure you guys knew."
I then said to Melinda. 'well first off, I want to thank you for
your efforts in traveling out here.
Melinda next said. "Since she is not available, I will probably
take it upon myself to send whatever letters are needed," Melinda
says. "Somebody has to."
I then went further to state. 'Second, I want to express that i am
very troubled by the news. However, do consider that crime happens
to all citizens of all alliances.
'I am not happy with what has occurred.
Melinda then nodded in agreement.
I then said to Melinda. 'Still, I am not the Military. I am not
the aEU Government. My job is to be a messenger to our Government
Liaison on behalf of AEU pilots and nothing more.
I added with another question? 'So too, did Ather Jammoa send you
here?
"Nobody sent me," says Melinda.
I then said. 'ok well Akemi was acting rather hysterical saying
that I was wanted back there so I'm just trying to understand who
wants me back there.
Melinda, obviously not hearing my question says. "You are the
voice," says Melinda, "troubling times are at hand and here I am."
Melinda says, "We want some kind of word, people are getting
upset."
I responded with. 'yes but if our government felt I should be
there, they have the means to dispatch that request to me. I
informed them before I left of my plans as well.
Melinda asked the following which I hoped would be a good faith
effort on her part to convey my need for clarification. "So," asks
Melinda, "this is what you want me to tell people if they ask?"
She cut me off you see as I wasn't finished with what I had to say
which was. 'Even if i were there, I am not the party who can
control the behavior of aEU citizens.
Melinda says, "Of course you can't."
She continued with. "So, since you weren't asked for in an
official capasity, you will remain on said trip," Melinda says. "Is
this correct?"
I concurred by saying. 'well it's very much out of my hands. They
need to understand that it's not within my power to control AEU
Citizens. It is our government's responsibility to deal with those
issues. You can certainly convey to them in o uncertain terms that
I am not pleased with this behavior but it's also a typical over-
emphasis on the partof the media and related to recent elections no
doubt.
Melinda says, "Okay I will do this."
Melinda says, "All right."
Melinda Michaels then stood up to leave without repeating anything
back to me as well as she didn't let me finish what I was saying.
I just went on by stating. 'If I were back there, there really
isn't anything I could do.
Melinda then says, "I just hope nobody else dies."
She still wasn't allowing me to complete my statement. so I went
on to say. 'AEU pilots themselves haven't communicated anything to
me as well.. "That's fine," says Melinda.
Melinda says, "I tried."
'Thank you for doing so.
Melinda waved. Then she says, o very unceremoniously, Melinda
says, "Yup."
Melinda says, "Later."
I waved back rather amazed that she seemed both not interested in
what I was trying to gather from the scant information I had as
well as nothing official from the leadership from the league nor
Ather Jammoa or from any other AEU pilot back in Comms.
Melinda Michaels then rather rudely walked out. There is certainly more that I
would like to have discussed or to have asked if I could prepare a written
statement or even asked for a brief period of time to consider a request which
didn't come to me in an official capacity. Still, I would have. I took time to
consider Melinda's request albeit it was troubling that noone from the AEU
seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann in
his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went on
to Tom Town to charge overnight. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship
was charge onto Sea of Fears the next day. After a rather sleepless night, when
I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and very
apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at Sea of
Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better grasp of
the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann was very
gracious and he
said that he understood my concerns and that we could return to
Comms. Since there was no other means aboard Johann's Galleon to
communicate that we were returning, it is unfortunate that a hasty
decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf. I further find
it regretable that Melinda was in so much of a hurry not to allow
me to prepare a written statement which I couldn't have prepared
before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on. I apologize
to you all though as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation was
in the way of this order for me to return to Comms thus compromising the plans
of
others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that Ather
Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't have
hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison office.

Date November 17, 2316
Dear Mr. Lambeth,
I am providing a statement to you below which concerns my interactions with
Melinda Michaels after she arrived on Famous Andy's Trading Post whereby she
demanded my return to Comms. In addition, i want to share my own perspective and
that I never absolutely refused to return to Comms.
I am very sympathetic to others and especially when the news related such
horrific crimes towards humanity, why, then didn't any of our own pilots support
this? It seems that they only did so when it became apparent that it was a
problem for the AEU and i didn't act immediately on Melinda Michael's request.
Also, i want to point out to you that Kim Saunders who you have just appointed
as Voice of the Corps, yesterday evening, related confidential information which
was posted on our AEU Debate board over the General Channel concerning what I
wrote. Kim Saunders often confides in Melinda Michaels and others from the
League rather than to her own allies. How can we possibly trust someone who is
going to discuss every communication or otherwise which transpires on the AEU
message boards or over the AEU communications channel? Since I'm not able to do
so, I hope your office will, remind AEU pilots of the confidential nature
regarding AEU business and other issues is and how it is to be treated
confidentially and not shared outside of the AEU Pilot Corps. I certainly
thought that this related to what is posted on the message boards within the
AEU, discussions which take place on the aEU communications Channel as well as
during meetings and other exchanges which are specific to the AEU Pilot Corps.
Thank you and please see below.
During the evening of November 13th, 2316, Melinda Michaels arrived at Famous
Andy's Trading Post. We had not been there for a long time since we drifted off
course en route and it required about another day to get our bearings and to
correct our course. When melinda exited from her Capsule, I felt that she would
likely want to discuss this request from the hyperwave that I was wanted back in
Comms. I further would liked to have had the opportunity to prepare a written
statement to send back via Melinda Michaels. However, I didn't get the
opportunity to ask permission to do so. I also really wasn't given time to ask
very many questions. After Melinda Michaels abruptly exited the Galleon, she
went to the Bar and so I also went to the bar. Just as I was about to ask her if
she would consider discussing the situation further with me as well as I also
wanted to prepare something in writing, she bought food and then said her
goodbyes.
Herein is a transcript of the brief meeting between myself and
Melinda Michaels aboard Johann rowan's Galleon, 'Queen Brynn II'.
I ushered Melinda Michaels into the Control Room of the ship and the exchange
proceeded. I asked? "so Melinda do you have a letter from Nissi?" Melinda

AEU seemed as concerned as the League were. Since we were traveling with Johann
in his ship, I felt that we should at least finish his business and so we went
on to Tom Town to charge overnight and Johann obtained an upgrade for his
Galleon. Our plan was indeed to proceed after the ship was charge onto Sea of
Fears the next day. I still tried to understand why I hadn't heard anything from
the AEU. There were too many unanswered questions. After a rather sleepless
night, when I noticed that Johann was awake, I proceeded to the Control Room and
very apologetically asked johann if he would be able to forego artifacting at
Sea of Fears. That I felt that I should return to Comms to try to get a better
grasp of the situation there as well as to attempt to do what I could. Johann
was very gracious and he said that he understood my concerns and that we could
return to Comms. There was also no other means aboard Johann's Galleon in the
way of a Quantum Entanglement Device to communicate that we were returning. It
is unfortunate that a hasty decision was made by the AEU liaison on my behalf as
I had every intention to do my job. I just felt that the League were controlling
things without the AEU's involvement. I further find it regretable that Melinda
was in so much of a hurry not to allow me to prepare a written statement which I
couldn't have prepared before her arrival as I simply had so little to go on.
I apologize to you, as I did, in good faith, try to assess what the situation

plans of others without an official directive. Had Melinda even mentioned that
Ather Jammoa or other AEU pilot expressed that I should have returned I wouldn't
have hesitated even without anything official from the AEU Government Liaison
office.
As you can see, I never directly said that I wouldn't return. I didn't say a lot
to Johann Rowan because if his being a member of the League, there were certain
aspects which I didn't consider that he should be privy to. From my own personal
perspective. I'm not insensitive to other individuals from other alliances but
it seemed rather odd that the League were so intent on me when their own
leadership isn't performing. I so wish that Ather Jammoa would have at least
sent a statement or a request via the Hyperwave which we tried to monitor during
the times they can be typically used to transmit from the Torus. I was also not
aboard my own ship and didnt feel that i had total control over another pilot's
vessel. Johann Rowan was, however very gracious and did openly indicate that it
was my judgement call to return or not. Therefore, he is not to blame for the
delay.
I want to state that I deplore any and all acts of intimmidation, violance,
destruction of property or otherwise harm that has been inflicted upon any
individual, regardless of which Alliance, clan or where they are from. If those
acts which i have read about in the news are verifiable as a true representation
of fact, I urge the AEU to take immediate actions to seekout, prosecute and
punish those involved. No matter what has been expressed of others, I do not
hate nor wish any harm to be directed towards any human being from any part of
this universe. The AEU must absolutely uphold a zero tolerance to crimes against
humanity or any living being for that matter.

Hi Love, I'm writing this because I may forget to ask? The current Salvage
processor in 777 will go offline around 2245 on 12-25-2316. Unfortunately, I
won't be available from around 2000 on this date until approximately 0200 on
12-26-2316. Will most likely have the station ready to deploy from Herding Cats
though. If you're available and can deploy the replacement in Asteroid Alpha 285
around the time the current one goes offline, it would be a tremendous help.
Otherwise, I'm sure that it won't cause much of an inconvenience to others if
the new Salvage processor is delayed for a few hours. Thanks for anything you
can do to assist. Love you, - Lily

Hi Lily and Shule,
I have just put up the new Starseekers scooping station. I am sorry that this
was a bit later than you may have expected, but you will be happy to know that
SEAS is in on it now. Please let me or Morris know whether you are happy with
the megacredit income it gives you.
It will be up for 16 days regardless, and we can then see whether having you on
the station is benificial to both of our orgs or not, so, please let us know how
it goes.
Take care,
Kim

Greetings Melinda,
I discussed the Org rotation idea with Shule for the Grade 80 Debris Field. My
concern was that during the week, I am only available for a few hours during the
early morning from about midnight until around 0300. Then on Weekends, I am
generally available some of the time. Shule won't be working much, if at all,
during the first week in June. So we wouldn't want our rotation to occur during
that particular week. Otherwise, I feel confident that I have Shule's commitment
to back me up if our rotation turn occurs on a weekday or that the beacon chain
needs replacement when I am not able to work.
So, ccount on SEAS to commit to a rotation slot to help to maintain the Grade 80
Beacon Chain.
With kind regards,
Lily Kaise

Kim,
Below is a copy of the letter I have just sent off to Sir Wellington concerning
this Allied Pirate issue.
During the course of the salvage op event that many pilots partook in, there was
an understanding. Mutuality pilot Pierre Louis as well as AEU pilot Eli Gray
brought us some information. We were told that the Allied Pirates would steer
clear of the area seeing as Mutuality friends were in the area.
Due to the large number of IFS and Outsiders in the area, Mister Kelsey says
that he had a group out there ready to defend. The incident that I recall is the
following: Myself, Morris Corlew and Nicolette Lawrence were salvaging. Jason
Rat, Bryan Stout, Emily Ford, Damien Goss and Shule Elemmire were aboard the
gunship. I believe it was my gunship, "The Storm Petrel." The issue is that
Mister Kelsey believes a cease fire was broken when the gunship fired upon his
area defenders. I was waiting in the neighboring sector with the op can so have
no idea who fired first or anything of that nature. I do believe that this was
the op in which they had to switch ships to, a pincer called, "The Wolves have
Claws," so that AEU pilot Kim Saunders could be added to the defense. I also
believe that most of the pilots thought the pirates would not be getting
involved in ops but did not realize they wouldn't be causing issues otherwise.
At any rate, I am inquiring as to whether or not we can find out who fired first
on behalf of the Mutuality pilots. I plan to ask the pilots aboard the ship
about this incident as well.
The other incident that I recall was during the early morning hours, I saw a
couple of pirates come into the sector. I did launch my corvette and they
promptly vacated the sector. I did not fire and was not fired upon.

If the glyph at the door flashes black, we cancel it. If white, we match it. So
if we get a red one, it'll flash black, flash a blue and a yellow. If we get an
indigo that flashes white, we first make a violet glyph, then a blue one. If
that indigo flashes black, we cancel it by making a saffron glyph (make an
orange glyph, then add yellow).

Note - there may be some mistakes in spelling, etc here but I found these notes
concerning Ifs.
Target priority for IFS beacons or invasions
For IFS, you basically want to take out the heavy hitters first.
Almost all of them are able to constantly hit you, and the quicker
you can reduce the rate of damage you're taking the better off
you will be
1. Hades. These just fire constantly and do a lot of damage.
2. Poseidons. Not as bad as Hades, but pretty bad.
3. Artemises. Basic long range attackers, they'll hit you
steadily but not very quickly.
4. Ares. Like Artemises but they can't take a hit.
5. Apollos. No long range attacks. Save them for last.
a few special notes --
Hestia - If you see one of these and you're not in a cruiser...
you should probably leave it to someone who is. They hit very
very hard and they can launch fighters.
Chronos - A very dangerous IFS flagship. Avoid unless you're a
very good pilot. Very good pilot is an understatement these are wicked to deal
with and you will likely lose.
Deployment Apollos - These are about to drop a forward assault station.
But you have some time to take them out before they do. If you see
one of these jump in and you're nearby, drop your current target and
go after it.
This may be the Ifs that looks like a carrier.
Researchers weren't noted but I am pretty sure they would be targeted after the
Poseidons and Ares are destroyed. I'm pretty sure you will see Researchers
mostly on a Beacon or you will see an Ares and a Researcher show up sometimes. I
need to ask Ather.
Interdiction does occur and I thought it was the carrier class but when that
Chronos jumped in on Blake's beacon that time we were interdicted. I was too
busy to check all of the ships and since I was engineering, I couldn't access
other details.

Shule, Just in case I fall asleep and am not awake by the time we're supposed to
leave, please can you do the following? If you don't see the aquariums still
sitting around in William Dove, put them all on a hoverpallet and take them with
you? Also, the little pink bed is on a hoverpallet in the airlock of William
Dove, please put it on your hoverpallet and take it with you? Also, all five pet
felo are still in william Dove. Please ask Nissi if it's ok to put them aboard
her Imperator as I do have food bowls for them and please keep those two bags of
chow which I asked you to buy for them. I hope I will have managed to get the
food together. If not, we'll have some day old pizzas and things and there is a
vending machine which has food aboard the Imperator which is the same as the
Galleon so we won't starve! I'll have Asteria with me. There's just a situation
which may cause me to have to sleep unexpectedly. If I'm awake, I'll have taken
care of all of these things. I just want to be sure that the fish aquariums
which comprise yours and mine are taken along with us. If Nissi doesn't want the
pets aboard, they will be fine in William dove for probably a few weeks as
there's 15 bowls for 5 felo so even if Purr isn't around to mind the bowls, they
will be fine. Also, Kim can put her pets in with mine in William dove if Nissi
says no pets. I will still need to get with you to put the two robots aboard
your ships. Again, hopefully I'll have taken care of everything. Just being
precautionary. Hugs! - Lily

Shule,
I know Tatiana Krupin will seek you out now after our last two exchanges. I am
copying in my final post to her below. Although I won't go out of my way to
approach her, one aspect that she needs to accept is that she is not permitted
to silence our outrage. If she can speak out, so should we be able to. I also
wasn't harrassing her but applying peer pressure but it's without a doubt that
she is beyond reason. I know too that you must be careful in your own approach
with Krupin but as a peer, I can certainly express what I want and I have. If I
were in your position, for professional reasons, I certainly would have to
phrase differently. If you do ask her to resign it should likely be moreso that
you remind her of our positions as holding a leadership role and how her own
conduct is also scrutinized by other alliances and that our respective behavior
can and will affect diplomatic relations. Of course this is up to you and you
know exactly how to word it. If I wer her though, I'd much prefer to resign than
to have the whole of AEU civilian pilots voting against me. This obviously
doesn't phase her though. It's very surreal that reality simply does not
register with this woman.
This is my very last post to Krupin -
Tatiana Krupin, I daresay that you have far more to deal with concerning your
own reputation and behavior than I ever will. The reason why I disliked you
early on was for behavior and arrogance exactly like what you just exonerated
through your recent actions. I am a reasonable person and if, for a moment, I
felt that your case was valid, I would be supportive and this would be
regardless of my own opinion of you. i believe in justice and your attempts to
effect unfounded injustice towards our own who have endured far more than you
could ever imagine, worked hardest for us, discovered wonders and are the very
core of our Core vallue. You are truly a poor excuse for a human being and for
your dishonorable abuse. You will indeed pay for your offenses against civilian
pilots. I promise to be there to cheer on the judges. I shall speak to you
whenever I so desire as well. You cannot silence me nor can anyone. I'll likely
not waste my time with writing to you further however as you are beyond
worthwhile of my time and effort.

Hello Takana and shule, I am concerned about how you both were treated by Joel
Kringle today. If this was a practical joke, it's ok and I hope both of you are
the better for it. If it wasn't, then please take any concerns such as these to
our Voice of the Corps, Annie Lynn. While she can't force other pilots to treat
you fairly, at least she is there to talk to and through her leadership,
encouraging some level of fair treatment amongst pilots would be in order. Pilot
life isn't the easiest. There will always be those who will are rude and treat
more vulnerable pilots unreasonably. For you both, please don't let your guard
down ever and be careful concerning what you say to other pilots, particularly
to those who are not in our alliance and what you ask of them. Hang in there! -

We have a couple of options or to do both:
Go to GMG
Or
go to Hall of Pain as shown below to artifact for Alien Artifacts as there's
perhaps a week to ten days left on the stations along the way which I imagine
are up for recharging purposes.
I have time available through Monday but Tuesday I'll not be working much except
that i'll be around on a limited basis until about 1500 to 1600. Tuesday would
be an ok day for traveling in the rift to or from Hall of pain provided you're
comfortable with flying solo. i'd be around later on Tuesday between 0200 and
0400.
So we can go to GMG and then head for Hall of Pain sometime this weekend or so
or go straight out to Hall of Pain and do GMG befor Tuesday or later next week?
Here is the Hall of Pain info --
Heading to Hall of Pain
100 Light-Years at a heading of 270 -2. Then 150 or so Light-Years 270, 0"
Total travel distance is about 250 Light-Years or just a little more than 32

Starseekers expedition Information
 
Hello,
I write this letter to you to confirm that you are on the crew list of the
expedition I am organizing. this letter also contains some information about the
trip.
 
- we wil be traveling aboard Akemi's science vessel, which she kindly has made
available for this occasion. akemi will hand out keys just before departure. we
will bring a few other ships along, keys for these will be handed out if and as
needed.
- We will start gathering for departure on the first of June at 23:00 GST. we
wil meet on Old Earth in the coffee shop. this coffee shop is located in the
spaceport, between the landing pad and the south point exit. We are aiming for a
departure time of 23:59 GST.
- You should be prepared for a trip that will take roughly 2 weeks. Melinda has
made various food and drink dispensers available, but it might be nice if you
brought a small amount of food for greater variety.
- to keep it fair for everyone, and to make sure we can bring a full crew,
everyone is allowed to bring only 1 pet felo. If you choose to bring one, you
are also required to bring a felo spacesuit for it.
- we will have a few crew members who have never been on an expedition like
this. If you do not have any rift drive repair tools yet, do not worry. akemi
has spare tools available and we will still have time to craft more of such
tools.
- As of the time of this writing, the crew for this expedition is as follows:
Akemi, anfisa, Melinda, Lillian, shule, Lily, Nissi, Liam, Michael, Blake,
simon, Nathaniel, Morris, Sakura, Zandria and myself. 
 
should you have any questions that I have not answered in this letter, feel free
to contact me and ask. also if you are not sure you are still awake during the
gathering and departure time, talk to me or Akemi and we will make arrangements
with you.
I am sure we are all looking forward to a fun expedition, and see you tomorrow!
take care,
Kim (Starseekers founder)

Date -- 1/4/2317
Liam,
This is one more attempt to provide an accomodation for your organization on
organization sponsored temporary space stations.
I have room for an Ejecter on a Salvage processing and an Asteroid processing
station. The Salvage processing station is currently located in Asteroid Alpha
285 and alternates with Artifact Alpha 777. The Asteroid processor is located in
Asteroid Alpha 285 and provides fairly consistent Megacredits and an occasional
Command point as well as reasonable cash flow. The Salvage processing station
will expire early Saturday morning or 1/7. The replacement will be placed in
Artifact Alpha 777 which has grade 20 to 40 Shipwrecks. This obviously isn't
extremely high grade debris but pilots do find there is a consistent occurance
of grade 40. Still, alternating the salvage processor is an experiment to
determine which of the two areas pilots prefer for obtaining salvage. Therefore,
for the time being, we plan to alternate placing the salvage processor between
Artifact Alpha 777 and Asteroid Alpha 285.
I am enclosing a key to my Module Transport, Building Capital. We use the least
expensive Ejecter which is the Unmanned Pickup. These cost one Megacredit or 5
million EAOS credits. If you would like to participate, please place 2 to 4 of
an Unmanned Pickup ejecter module aboard Building Capital and we will accomodate
Eternal Freedom. At this time, I don't have another organization who is seeking
a slot on these stations and if I don't obtain parts from Eternal Freedom, then
one organization will have to double up on providing parts which works but
unnecessary duplication.
Best regards,
Lily Kaise

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service
robot here.
You can go south and out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and a Tardick lizard named
Asteria here.

two halves of a drop pod suddenly descend onto you and seal around you. A moment
later, you feel sudden acceleration as your pod is launched from the aerial

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some

The pod shudders violently as it speeds through the interior of the enemy

With a sudden burst of thrust, the drop pod slows abruptly. There is another
thud as it impacts a surface, then the walls are suddenly peeling back, freeing
you.

This appears to be an access point to a space station's large ventilation

the metal somewhat. But anything is better than a ventilation system filled with
giant bugs and mold!

amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins

here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole

wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon
purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies,
a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light
purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch
