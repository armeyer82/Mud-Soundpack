Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee
dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser
here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident (asleep)
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average, naturally
shaped breasts with prominent rosy nipples. Her abdomen is attractive and
punctuated by a cute navel. More intimately, she has soft pale honey blonde
pubic hair and a girlish butt. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose
and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part
to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are
blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey
blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval
pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled
cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean
blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing nothing. She is also wearing an elegant white gold ring inset
with a perfect solitaire diamond, a delicate ring of silver wire and small
purple amethyst crystals, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her
wrist, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, and a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells
around her wrist. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, chest, back,
both biceps, both elbows, abdomen, both forearms, both wrists, both hands,
waist, both hips, groin, both thighs, both knees, both calves, both ankles, and
both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

if it happens again I'll send up a ticket."
[Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "Ta."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Double check you didn't match to the
wrong container when you were putting it in. Or if it was a ration box and it
was purchased empty...that may well be something to support."
[Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "I checked it when I first got it. It
had like 4 or 5 things in it iirc. Mistargeted the box on the shelf, pulling it
down instead of the shine crate and the ration box was empty."
[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. Ration boxes could be different? I
honestly don't know. I've not used them much since more palatable food is
available widely in game."
[Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "I like to be prepared."

database bloat."

[Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Possible. Stuff like that tends to be
made to disappear after awhile. Not surprising since it builds up bloat in the
database."
[Newbie Help] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "Noted. I should probably keep my shine
box closed in that case."
[Newbie Help] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I have emptied them into
a cooler before but yes I believe they may likely decay in a shorter period if
you don'tput the contents into a cooler."

statement in a short while."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Alright. It's been
some time since I have had the notice myself. I believe the one you are asking
after says that SEAS will not be reconstructing their temporary salvage station
and encourages pilots to reconsider working at the moment, yes?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Emmelie Princeton transmits, "Yes. Why would
you not work?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "I am continuing to
work. However, there are a number of pilots staging protests against the
direction of our government. They are refusing to work, and thus bring money in
for the government, in retaliation for the stance held regarding Unregs and,
more grievously, the amnesty offered to the rogue navy and Janus."

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
