-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

03:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a black plastic tray of spider chow here.
You can go out.

We will be setting up a beacon at this field for some artifacting. Since nobody wants to go far from home right now, this field is pretty close and we can get home within a day and far less via capsule. If people are interested, join us. If anybody wants to go down with myself or Morris to put up stations, yell.

You will travel to the end of the 270 beacon chain and then the field is aproximately 162 light-years from there. It is south and very slightly down but you may be able to hit it at 270 and 0. I wouldn't go more than -1 or -2 and pay attention to your drift if you are not used to it. At about 142 to 144 light-years traveled, you should be able to find the artifact beacon and autotravel from there.

Again, if people want a lift rather than dealing with the travel, give us a yell. I will be labeling the beacon as 275 for convenience purposes.

23:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

23:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

23:02 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Asteroid Belt Management Station.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

Notice from Lily Kaise on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Greetings SEAS! A group is going out to Hall of Pain Early next week. If interested, please read the General Exploration Message Board. Shule and I don't have any immediate plans to go at this time. When we were there last, neither of us realized much value from the Artifacts and due to the unpleasant attitudes of League pilots, we're not particularly comfortable with hanging out and socializing with them at this time. It's a good place though for those with less than a few thousand in Exploration to gain good income and Exploration experience. If you want us for company, we would be willing to go out with you. Otherwise, don't forego this opportunity if you are up for it. I know that if it were worthwhile in other aspects, that Shule and I would attend. Fly safely and fight hard on the ground! [14:35 25 January 2318 GST]
Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! Sometime as early as late evening today or tomorrow and during the day over the weekend, I would like to attempt to resume the process of cleansing the Old Frontier. Asteroid Processing Station. Ather, shule and myself have acquired the new Testudinidae Battlesuit. I have run the Testudinidae on Tesla quite a bit and it rocks! Tesla. I certainly would like to promote that we work together to obtain this Battlesuit for everyone who is interested in owning one. Leading in the Testudinidae Bat
23:04 tlesuit does pose some challenge which I believe, with a little teamwork, that we can overcome. It does have an ability to attract the enemy, one can Stun and it does incredible damage. It does not possess the traditional Light Abilities which we are accustomed to utilizing on a League Battlesuit nor does it obviously have the Light ability of Burn. So an AEU Battlesuit with Light can use Burn as I have before without seeming to attract too much attention but if battlesuits who can interrupt the enemy's ability to fire can be very helpful. So let's do this and prove that we can manage without some other Alliance's Battlesuit once again! When I'm ready to begin forming our team, I will call out over the AEU Channel for participants. We'll meet in the New Earth Lounge and proceed. Fly safely and fight hard on the ground! [15:10 25 January 2318 GST]

[Teslatown; Finial Avenue] (inside a battlesuit)
Finial Avenue is a length of rather scorched concrete lined by the series of tall lightning rods that gives it its name. An arching metal lattice overhead and to either side forms a Faraday cage that keeps out electrical energy. Scientists and technicians walk up and down the street, wearing environmental suits which also act as Faraday cages in addition to possessing bulky cooling units. Among these people occasionally stride even larger figures: people in powered armor, their suits designed both for environmental protection and intense ground combat.

23:10 [Teslatown; Spaceport Landing Pad]

23:10 The landing pad, like all exterior portions of the facility, is covered with a giant Faraday cage which keeps out the electrical blasts that are hurled down from the sky on a regular basis. To stand in when the cage is opened, such as when a starship is departing or arriving, a number of tall lightning rods surround the pad, each attached to a drooping grounding wire that buries itself in the ground.

23:10 There is no significant network lag at the moment.

23:11 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

23:11 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

23:11 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

23:11 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Fearless, you are given launch clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

23:11 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

23:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

23:11 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

23:11 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:11 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

23:11 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

23:11 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

23:11 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

23:11 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:11 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

23:11 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

23:12 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

23:12 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

23:12 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Fearless! Welcome to The Torus!"

23:12 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

23:12 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

23:12 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

23:12 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Fearless. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

23:12 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

23:13 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

23:13 You pull a large lever towards you.

23:13 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

23:13 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

23:13 You scramble to your feet.

23:13 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

23:13 I can't find "sofa."

23:13 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

23:13 Onboard sensors detect the presence of the following people somewhere aboard the ship: Shule Elemmire.

23:13 Eject? [Enter `yes' or `no']

23:13 Not ejected.

23:13 Your ship 'Fearless' has been automatically moved into a garage.

23:13 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

23:17 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Exploration.

23:25 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a green glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

23:27 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a

23:42 [Starship "Fearless"; Control Room]

23:42 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a discount beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a greater minimodule of gravitic boost here.
You can go up and out.
