00:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs sighs.

00:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How do temporary charge boosters work? Do they boost your remaining charge by a certain amount, or do they just power your ship for a certain amount of time?"

00:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They give you about 20 minutes of charge."

00:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Enough to get you out of a bind."

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "From what I undestand.. they only charge after you charge them.."

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there any reason why you can't load your ship with hundreds to increase your range?"

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just prohibitive cost?"

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It would just be extremely impractical."

00:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I see."

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't think the ones you buy have to be chaerged up, but the ones you make do."

00:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. charged."

00:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's the range supposed to be on an improved salvage sensor? 8 units?"

00:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They also sell them at supply stores."

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, improved is 8."

00:09 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

00:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Reason I ask, is.. I have one installed. Flew to the center of the sector.. looked at the rundown.. and knew many should've been in range. But, none could be detected."

00:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I'm not sure."

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, my mistake.. two were just out of range."

00:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, yeah. I know sometimes when I'm trying to eyeball ranges I underestimate how far things are."

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "FInding a lot of only 0 grade at dusty... hmm."

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I guess 20 is fine in belt of orion."

00:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "My mistake."

00:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would just head out there, it's pretty good. 777 is good also."

00:13 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders south.

00:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah 777 is pretty good for points too, since the debris is small out of the shipwrecks."

00:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll check out 777 in a minute. Still just testing out this sensor."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "777 a shipwrek area?"

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yep, and an artifact field."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Er.. shipwreck."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh, nice."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "WIll have to remember that for future referance."

00:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "To get there, go to Mir and autotravel to 777."

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not Battle of Mir, just plain Mir."

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's even one of ours, in theory. The area belongs to everyone now, of course. But i9t's the remains of one of our naval forces I believe."

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I know mir well.. too well.. there's really nothing around there.. at all."

00:15 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it's the New Earth 40th, right?"

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I think so."

00:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or something like that."

00:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yep. Sensors work well."

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So what does the imager do? Is that what gets you money and points on expeditions?"

00:20 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess there's also probes."

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "It just takes initial pictures of special interest sites."

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And those pay decently."

00:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

00:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, it images an are of space and takes some basic sensor readings. Once you have one you can then upgrade it with the spectroscopy upgrades."

00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can also like, fly up close to certain things and get photos of them. Like I took one of Hyperion and had it posterized for example. But the primary purpose is for exploration, yes."

00:22 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The imager is made, right?"

00:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And takes 6 or 7 lenses, apparently."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Only a handful of folks can craft them."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do those only come from IFS debris, or is there a RATS scrap piece that you can derive them from."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The sensory apparatus from RATS has them too."

00:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, nice."

00:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Need to do more nests..."

00:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You could also try buying them from people. Though you are likely to be charged part of your soul, if not all of it."

00:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was told once... 120 mil per lense.."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Uh.. really? that sounds awfully cheap."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not for me, it isn't."

00:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well no, but I just mean in general."

00:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Ather, how much would you charge for a lense."

00:27 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the airlock.

00:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not selling."

00:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey chuckles. "Yeah, that sounds more like hte price I expected."

00:32 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, there are inserters set up to send you there without one."

00:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You just need to pay a toll."

00:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ah."

00:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is that 5 mil, both ways? Or, just one way?"

00:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Just to go out."

00:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Coming back is free."

00:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "There would be nothing comical about it. I've already started making vague plans in my head including restraining someone and tying them up to a scaffold. After they are tied up to a scaffold, I would raise and lower the ship repeatedly on it, lowering it each time at the scaffold's fastest speeds so that it would hit their head at a reasonably acceptible velocity."

00:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If not a scaffold, I can always use a crane."

00:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Whatever's lying around."

00:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Will reasonably acceptable velocity be used in my 1465 ball punches?"

00:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Only if it's -my- reasonably accepted velocity. I don't really give a shit about anyone else's, and you're actually up to 1802 now."

00:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I was vaguely contemplating giving him a counteroffer. Give me your balls in a jar, and we'll call the whole punching thing off."

04:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Any points you make will catch up to you. They'll trickle them down to you once you get your full license."

04:24 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and a cerulean glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You mentioned hauling earlier. While you can't get a hauler yourself, I believe you can still see if someone wants a hauling partner."

04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I can't do much artifacting.. as I lack the tools and the points to get them. I've done as much SVP missions I could do."

04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll go hauling with you."

04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "See? Boom."

04:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.

04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, but I sold my hauler when I thought I was going to the slam."

04:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I can get a new one though."

04:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And hauling salvage is getting extremely tedious with just a hauler.."

04:32 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws raises its claws at a small plastic statue of a Jinu and snaps them menacingly while dancing around it.

04:32 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

04:33 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins dips his palps into a black plastic tray of spider chow and pushes food into his mouth.

04:38 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles wraps its tentacles tightly around a small plastic statue of a Jinu, then loses interest and jets off.

04:39 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's unblinking eyes stare into the middle distance.

04:41 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person medium transport "Edmund Fitzgerald". The organization has earned 1,679,299.01 credits.

05:02 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator dings politely as it receives a new notice.

05:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What's that about?"

05:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not sure, but it sounds like someone made a large donation to the crash relief fund."

05:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "They're reporting on this now?"

05:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I suppose so."

05:10 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

05:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is that strange?"

05:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Or was it just donated, I wonder."

05:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Probably recently, yeah."

05:12 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior pulsates gently.

05:13 [Tactical Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Gateway is on alert."

05:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm at the bubble. Can anybody respond to Gateway?"

05:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm heading there, to check it out."

05:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, good."

05:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll head back."

05:14 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

05:14 [Tactical Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Heading in from the bubble in case help is needed."

05:14 [Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Checking out Gateway."

05:15 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are you engaging them, John?"

05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you are, send a general transmission urging them to flee. They may not have rescue pods."

05:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Do no such thing."

05:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, do no such thing."

05:18 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We're getting close to that first performance goal! Let's go!"

05:19 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I was a bit spacey, I'm at the bubble do folks need help?"

05:19 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders south.

05:19 [Tactical Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Will be fine, really."

05:20 [Tactical Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Good to know, just making sure."

05:21 I don't understand that.

05:22 You blink heavily and then doze off.

05:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, I guess that donation finally went through. I did that not long afterwards but sometimes things take time to go through all the proper channels when you are dealing with pilot credits."

05:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't really care about the spin, as long as the folks get the help they need."

05:27 Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the south.

05:32 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic flower with red petals.

05:35 Mischief the large black felo jumps down from your lap.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a gl

[Corbin Memorial Prison; Day Room]
This common area for the prison's inmates is a rather bleak place with gray stone walls, a gray tile floor kept spotlessly clean by free convict labor, and several security cameras conspicuously placed to catch every word and action no matter how small and trivial. In the center of the room, a gray sofa, several metal chairs, and a plastic table are bolted to the floor in a conversational grouping. A small window in one side wall provides access to a prison postal machine.
You see a gray stainless steel holovid, a silver and blue payphone, a broom, and a prison guard here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a long sofa.
You can go north, northeast, east, south, west, and northwest.

[Corbin Memorial Prison; Visitation Lobby]
Between the two lobbies here is a wall of clean transparisteel with a row of chairs on either side. At the far end of the room on the north side of the wall, a tall, narrow security door leads north into the interior of the prison, and on the south side of it is a doorway to the stairway leading up to the front desk. Every single centimeter of the room is monitored by conspicuously placed security cameras.
Katina Faye is on the other side.
You can go north.

22:54 You sit down on a long sofa with thin gray cushions.

22:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident

22:54 She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
 She is wearing an orange prison-issue jumpsuit. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.
