begin trying to recruit you.

The command LOOK gives you basic information about any room, object, or player. 
LOOK by itself shows you the room you're in, or you can LOOK <object> to look at
something specific.
	Travel:
As in most games of this sort, travel is accomplished by typing any cardinal
direction (north, southwest, etc.) or an abbreviation (n, sw, etc.).  "Up",
"down", "enter", and "out" are also directions you'll see used.  You can see all
valid directions at any time by LOOKing.  You may also notice references to
doors, gates, or buildings which have no associated direction; in this case, you
may GO DOOR or GO GATE or GO <business name> in order to travel.
	Social Commands:
Numerous social commands are available.  See HELP COMMANDS for a list.
	Important commands:
ASSIST puts in a request for help from a host.
CANCEL cancels an assist.
USERS or WHO shows a list of connected players and on-duty hosts.
CASH or CREDITS gives you a summary of all your currency, and a total amount.
        Policies:
Star Conquest has several important policies which are necessary to maintain
game continuity and to make the game fair and balanced for every player.  You
may view these at any time by typing POLICY.  All players are expected to know
the policies, and we've done our best to make them clearly understandable;
ignorance is not a valid excuse.
	Starting out:
You'll want to get in space, as it's really the only means of making money at
first, and is the only method of transportation to most other areas.  If you
find someone looking for a crew, you may consider joining.  Otherwise, you can
purchase a ship of your own.  Capital planets (see HELP ALLIANCES) as well as
some other large spaceports have ship stores.  Find one, and look at the ships
there.  "The Complete Guide to Modern Starships," available in book stores (see
below), provides an overview of all the ships.  You may wish to read it first. 
Keep in mind you can only take out 2000000 credits for a ship loan.  Though you
can buy only a flitter or cargo hauler at first, you should decide which model
you wish to work towards next.  Once you have decided on a model, find an ATM,
USE it, and apply for the appropriate amount.  You may then purchase your ship.
	Ship information:
-Put your ship's key on your keychain, and the ship will unlock and lock
automatically when you board it.
-Additionally, you may LOCK or UNLOCK your ship key to lock or unlock your ship.
 This is only necessary when entering your ship, and not when leaving.
-Never leave your ship floating in space, locked or not.  It can, and almost
surely will, be stolen or destroyed.
-Also, always lock your ship when it's docked or landed.  Again, someone is
likely to find it if it's unlocked and steal or destroy it.
-There are no help files about flying your ship.  Instead, help in this area is
provided in the form of books.  Each capital planet (one of which is the planet
you start on) has a bookstore that sells these.  One of your first acts should
be to find this bookstore.
	Books:
Bookstores are located in main areas on every capital planet of each alliance. 
(See HELP ALLIANCES for more information.) Once you have ordered books you want,
refer to the books by the last word in their title: starships for the "Complete
Guide to Modern Startships", navigation for "The Layman's Guide to Modern
Starship Navigation," etc.
OPEN <book> to open it.
READ <book> to see the current page.
TURN <book> TO <page #> to change pages.
	Communicators:
The best way to get help is from more experienced players.  Star Conquest has
several systems designed to help you communicate with the other players.  The
most commonly-used form is the metachannel FTL communicator, which provides
public channels for your alliance, as well as a general channel for everyone. 
Most players keep these communicators on continually; thus they are the best
method of contacting anyone.  See HELP COMMUNICATORS for more information.
	Message Boards:
The message board net is a game-wide message system available to every player. 
In addition, announcements from the staff and other important information is
often posted there.  Thus, it's a good idea to purchase a message board reader,
available at any communications store.
        Additional Problems?
You may run into some problems whose solution eludes you.  You're not the only
one.  The average newbie wakes up on his or her second day and finds that the
ship is out of power.  If you're having such problems, you may find the solution
in HELP TROUBLESHOOTING.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a
drifting cloud of tritium.

Overview of the Functions of a Control Room
The control room is the nerve center of every starship.  It must be manned for
any remotely complex operation.  It is the most frequently-used room, and it has
the greatest number of commands, as well as the most complex.
To quote from the previous volume in this series, the control room handles such
mundane tasks as:
 - Intrasector travel using the reactionless drive.
 - Travel between sectors using the FTL/wormhole drive.
 - Landing on planets, or docking with space stations.
 - Docking with or communicating with other starships in space.
 - Scanning other starships or for specific items of interest in space.
 - Managing transfer or expulsion of cargo and/or debris.
 - Maneuvering against enemy starships in combat and avoiding incoming weapons
fire.
 - Shipwide alert status.
 - Coordination.
 - Salvaging.

Three-Dimensional Iconic Sector Representation System
This system is much more commonly known as, simply, the starmap.  Starmaps are
standard equipment in every control room, as well as every weapon room and
engineering.  The symbols they utilize are universal across all classes and
alliances.  Here is an example of a starmap:
Sector 18: Centauri (League) [Human Interalliance Space]
 --------------------
|                    |
|                    |         ---------------
|                    |        |               |
|      #             |        |               |
|              O     |        |               |
|     *              |        |    O*      #  |
|           *        |X-axis  |   #      #    |Z-axis
|    O               |  |     |               |
|           O        |  v     |      *        |
|                    |        |        O    * |
|       #            |        |       O       |
|                    |        |               |
|            #       |         ---------------
|              *     |            X-axis ->
|                    |
 --------------------
       Y-axis
The first line contains the sector catalog number, its common name, and its
current controller, as well the general area of space that it occupies. 
Everything else, inside the rectangles, is the starmap itself.  The icon key is
as follows:
     O -- Planet
     o -- Moon
     # -- Large Space-Based Structure
     * -- Star
     ~ -- Debris
     % -- Asteroid
     $ -- Interdictor
     + -- Docking Module
     ] -- Guard Wasp Deployer
     = -- Jumpgate
     / -- Blockade
     " -- Alien Artifact
     : -- Space Mine
     7 -- Autoturret
     ` -- Combat Wasp
     X -- Your Starship
Any other symbols appearing on a starmap will represent other starships or
temporary space structures.
The area key is as follows:
     Human Interalliance Space    -- Space colonized and claimed by the four
Human factions.
     Yura Oh Jinu                 -- Translates as Space Of Jinu. Sectors owned
by the friendly Jinu species.
     Outsider Space               -- Space owned by the aggressive alien species
known as Outsiders.
     Known Space                  -- An area equal to 300 square lightyears
encompassing Human and Jinu space.
     Local Space                  -- An area equal to 1000 square lightyears
encompassing Known Space.
All sectors are defined as a specific volume of space with the dimensions of
15x20x10 'units'. The X axis (vertically on the large rectangle and horizontally
on the small rectangle) is 15 units, the Y axis (horizontally on the large
rectangle) is 20 units, and the Z axis (vertically on the small rectangle) is 10
units.
The easiest way to visualize a sector is to imagine that the large rectangle is
looking down on the sector from above, a birds-eye view if you will. The small
rectangle is looking at the sector from a side profile view.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

Exploring The Dark Reaches Of The Galactic Void
     So you want to be a Galactic explorer.  Well, a good way to start is to get
into space, take a good long look at your starmap, then switch to manual control
and fly off the edge.
     However, you'll quickly find that you have no idea where you are or where
you're going.  You'll also find that, for the most part, one sector of uncharted
space is pretty much like any other.  Even a densely-packed star cluster is
mostly void.  There is a huge volume of space out there and no landmarks to
guide you.
     This is where the Galactic coordinate system comes in handy.  Much as every
object has its own in-sector coordinates, each sector has its own set of
coordinates in the Galaxy.  The Galactic Plane lies on a standard X-Y plane, and
the Z-axis determines distance above or below the Plane.  From all of Known
Space, Coreward is Galactic East, Rimward is Galactic West, spinward is Galactic
North, and antispinward is Galactic South.  These directions provide a useful
reference when recording important coordinates.
     With the advent of FTL travel, distance is not important -- almost!  You
see, location is still extremely important, and with distance, location becomes
difficult to judge.  This is why, as you move away from Known Space, you will
gradually lose touch with the FTL beacons that have come to indicate the
presence of Galactic civilization.  First, you will be out of range of the
standard beacons that allow travel to specific sectors, and will be able to do
only a rough triangulation on Known Space.  Second, at a larger distance, you
will lose touch with communications beacons and become isolated.  And finally,
at a very large distance, you will lose touch with long-range FTL beacons (which
the Jinu call "munroujuhk"), and will not be able to open a wormhole back.
     Distance is also important because, once you are unable to jump, the range
determined by your ship's batteries becomes important.  Though the range that
can be squeezed out of even a flitter can be surprisingly large with proper
planning, you will need to find or establish refueling stations to travel any
significantly long distances.
     We hope that this introduction to Galactic navigation has been enjoyable
and informative.  If you wish to find out more about what exactly is out there,
you can read HELP REWARDS.  However, the best way to learn navigation is to
venture outside mapped space and find your way around.

Advanced Ownership Options
     As you become rich and powerful, you may begin to contemplate galactic
domination.  There are several advanced ownership options to help you achieve
this.  Each such purchase or activity must be approved by the hosts and by your
alliance.
     - House: Pilots are entitled to their own custom-built private residence on
any colonized planet upon reaching the 1500 point level.  The standard range of
cost is at least 1 billion credits, depending, of course, on what you ask to be
constructed.  Go to Paradise Homes on New Earth to begin the construction
process.
     - Business: You may choose to operate a business on a volunteer basis. 
This will have varying startup costs.  Depending on what sort of business it is,
it may be housed in a building or a space station.  There is no points
requirement for this.  If you are interested in starting a business, write a
letter to Agnes Croquette detailing exactly what kind of business you want to
start. Startup costs generally begin in the billion range.
     - Permanent Space Station: A privately-owned space station may be purchased
at the 30000 point level for 50 billion EAOS credits.
     - Planetary Colony: A privately-owned planetary colony may be purchased at
the 50000 point level for 200 billion EAOS credits.
     Space stations and planetary colonies will remain unarmed.  Otherwise, the
design will be left entirely to the owner(s), within reason.  The prices listed
are for basic options only, and the price will increase dramatically depending
upon which facilities are included.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

help starting
---------------------
Help on: Starting-out
---------------------
This help file is intended to provide you with a quick start into Star Conquest.
	Talking:
To talk, you may use "say," a single quote, or a double quote.
Examples:
say Hello.
'Hello.
"Hello.
	Looking:
The command LOOK gives you basic information about any room, object, or player. 
LOOK by itself shows you the room you're in, or you can LOOK <object> to look at
something specific.
	Travel:
As in most games of this sort, travel is accomplished by typing any cardinal
direction (north, southwest, etc.) or an abbreviation (n, sw, etc.).  "Up",
"down", "enter", and "out" are also directions you'll see used.  You can see all
valid directions at any time by LOOKing.  You may also notice references to
doors, gates, or buildings which have no associated direction; in this case, you
may GO DOOR or GO GATE or GO <business name> in order to travel.
	Social Commands:
Numerous social commands are available.  See HELP COMMANDS for a list.
	Important commands:
ASSIST puts in a request for help from a host.
CANCEL cancels an assist.
USERS or WHO shows a list of connected players and on-duty hosts.
CASH or CREDITS gives you a summary of all your currency, and a total amount.
        Policies:
Star Conquest has several important policies which are necessary to maintain
game continuity and to make the game fair and balanced for every player.  You
may view these at any time by typing POLICY.  All players are expected to know
the policies, and we've done our best to make them clearly understandable;
ignorance is not a valid excuse.
	Starting out:
You'll want to get in space, as it's really the only means of making money at
first, and is the only method of transportation to most other areas.  If you
find someone looking for a crew, you may consider joining.  Otherwise, you can
purchase a ship of your own.  Capital planets (see HELP ALLIANCES) as well as
some other large spaceports have ship stores.  Find one, and look at the ships
there.  "The Complete Guide to Modern Starships," available in book stores (see
below), provides an overview of all the ships.  You may wish to read it first. 
Keep in mind you can only take out 2000000 credits for a ship loan.  Though you
can buy only a flitter or cargo hauler at first, you should decide which model
you wish to work towards next.  Once you have decided on a model, find an ATM,
USE it, and apply for the appropriate amount.  You may then purchase your ship.
	Ship information:
-Put your ship's key on your keychain, and the ship will unlock and lock
automatically when you board it.
-Additionally, you may LOCK or UNLOCK your ship key to lock or unlock your ship.
 This is only necessary when entering your ship, and not when leaving.
-Never leave your ship floating in space, locked or not.  It can, and almost
surely will, be stolen or destroyed.
-Also, always lock your ship when it's docked or landed.  Again, someone is
likely to find it if it's unlocked and steal or destroy it.
-There are no help files about flying your ship.  Instead, help in this area is
provided in the form of books.  Each capital planet (one of which is the planet
you start on) has a bookstore that sells these.  One of your first acts should
be to find this bookstore.
	Books:
Bookstores are located in main areas on every capital planet of each alliance. 
(See HELP ALLIANCES for more information.) Once you have ordered books you want,
refer to the books by the last word in their title: starships for the "Complete
Guide to Modern Startships", navigation for "The Layman's Guide to Modern
Starship Navigation," etc.
OPEN <book> to open it.
READ <book> to see the current page.
TURN <book> TO <page #> to change pages.
	Communicators:
The best way to get help is from more experienced players.  Star Conquest has
several systems designed to help you communicate with the other players.  The
most commonly-used form is the metachannel FTL communicator, which provides
public channels for your alliance, as well as a general channel for everyone. 
Most players keep these communicators on continually; thus they are the best
method of contacting anyone.  See HELP COMMUNICATORS for more information.
	Message Boards:
The message board net is a game-wide message system available to every player. 
In addition, announcements from the staff and other important information is
often posted there.  Thus, it's a good idea to purchase a message board reader,
available at any communications store.
        Additional Problems?
You may run into some problems whose solution eludes you.  You're not the only
one.  The average newbie wakes up on his or her second day and finds that the
ship is out of power.  If you're having such problems, you may find the solution
in HELP TROUBLESHOOTING.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "On my last vacation I went on
an expedition in to a wild and alien world. The people there spoke a weird lingo
and insisted on rising very early. They would eat a massive breakfast. Then they
would walk or draw for a while. They would have a small meal near noon, then go
out visiting all their friends and acquaintances. If those were not present
(because they were visiting their friends and acquaintances) they'd leave a card
saying they'd been there. They'd eat a supper of many courses, then dance or go
to the theatre, have another light meal, then go to bed."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Eli, most themes written for a

message?"
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Those people were weird they
lit their houses with potentially deadly gases, and burned potentially unhealthy
stones for warmth, it was awful."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well then on my last

make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So I think I broke 777."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wasn't able to set a
message on the beacon, and now no one can travel there."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are those two things
related?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Shouldn't be. Did you set
headings?"
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I set headings on the
inserters I put in Mir and in 777."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I've used both since I
did that."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Hmm, I will take a look."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Okay."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "The beacon didn't get labeled
so for the moment it's 73573. Also, we don't have the toll up."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, sorry about that. Is
labeling separate from setting a message?"
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "So we gotta travel to 73573?"
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yep. You shouldn't need to
label if you catch the beacon before it falls, but if you replace it after the
fact you will need to relabel."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "And yes, for now. I am going
out there to label it."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. I'll replace it
earlier next time."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks Johann."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "No problem."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, my first rift trip on my
ownbegins."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Constantine, if you want to
throw the toll up, it's 5000000."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."
[General Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That was unsettling."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I can't do that."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess trustees only?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "How do I check my
eta?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a 'rift'
button."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It will list a
bunch of commands for you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Rift status is
what you want."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'll fix it in a minute."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Thirty two minutes in
the rift. Woo. It looked like I was warping into some living creature."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, the
rift is crazy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That travel time
isn't too bad. Hopefully the flow will shift and give you a speedy return when
you decide to come back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've gone on
trips out there and had it take over an hour each way."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Done."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I'm going to need to
get a payout before I return if they're making the toll five million, heh. I
spent a lot of money upgrading my scout and firefly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well the return
trip has no toll."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "So basically you
got a free ride out of my incompetence."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone cheers.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Remember, flee
to an adjacent sector or go to the watch tower if there are any enemies. And 776
to get back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "The speed of the rist
is absoutly insane.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Rift, even."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Glad I brought my
coffee dispenser."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights

Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole

[Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

Evenia an Eachtrannach
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about six feet and zero inches tall and
has dark brown skin. Her body is firmly muscled with wide hips and well-muscled
calves. She has broad shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and somewhat pretty, with a pointed nose and strong chin. Her lips
are full and rosy brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of sharp teeth.
Beneath a set of dark eyebrows, her eyes are dark brown and wide. Her
waist-length, curly hair is ebony with metallic silver streaks and in loose
ringlets drawn up into carefree cluster of curls at the top of her head, with
long tendrils framing her face. She has long painted shimmering ice blue
fingernails. She has several dark red cardinal feathers hanging from a length of
braided ash brown leather in her hair.
A curved gold barbell with a small diamond on each end pierces her septum, a
sparkling diamond stud pierces her tongue, a thick gold ring with a dolphin
charm pierces her left upper ear, a thick gold ring with a spider charm pierces
her right upper ear, a small enameled golden yellow dragon pierces her right
earlobe, and a small enameled golden yellow dragon pierces her left earlobe.
 She is wearing an exquisite floral choker of sapphires and emeralds, a black
leather jacket with numerous zippers and snaps, a pair of thick black leather
wrist bands with two rows of half-inch-long darkly gleaming steel cone studs, a
gold link chain with a onyx dagger suspended from it around her waist, a pair of
very short black and deep blue sequined shorts with a v-front, and a pair of
sleek black vinyl boots with numerous silver zippers. She is also wearing an
eye-catching gold ring inset with a small yellow and purple dichroic glass
dolphin, a chunky scrap metal necklace, a necklace with a silver charm
resembling a circle of inward-facing sharp points, a gold wrist-mounted
chronometer, a finely crafted linked bracelet of small chainguns of blue and
gold dichroic glass framed in gold, a teal battle hummingbird stamp, a gold link
bracelet with a lapis lazuli dagger suspended from it, a stamp of a blue
dragonfly superimposed over the planet Hyperion, and a metallic gold touch
einrophone in a black leather phone holster. Her head, face, both eyes, both
hands, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both ankles are left uncovered.
She is carrying an old big violet soldier felo in her right hand, and an old
normal violet soldier felo in her left hand.

[Starship "Bari Fighter"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a bari hive, a small horde of larval bari, an old big violet soldier
felo, an old normal violet soldier felo, and Vartija the arachnoid security
robot here.

Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[General Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Or
better...glorious superflare."
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
5MZZ#MI*ibLGuI9GE[5/y=C>Jt-C)s+#L02Y]\|h
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds
unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash roars through the starship, burning the walls
away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren

humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
