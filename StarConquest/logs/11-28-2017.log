00:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yo."

00:04 [General Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good evening."

00:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Hi."

00:09 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Megapod, anyone?"

00:09 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Any interest ina megapod?"

00:09 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Yes."

00:09 [Tactical Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Give me a few minutes and then yes."

00:09 [Tactical Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Ooh, yeah."

00:09 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "What shall I bring, what shall I bring!"

00:09 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What do you have, what do you have!"

00:10 [Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Sexy earth lounge."

00:10 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I have suits, wonderful suits!"

00:10 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Of what alliance!"

00:10 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I currently have a rental 2, fringe 3 and that's it."

00:10 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Well my fringe 3 is currently a league 2, but we can fix this!"

00:10 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The fringe will not work."

00:10 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "I can transform it to a lovely plasma 2!"

00:11 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sounds good."

00:11 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Just for this special moment."

00:11 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] An asteroid has been received at League Asteroid Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the two-person hardened asteroid hauler "Blue Eagle". The organization has earned 666,129.85 credits.

00:11 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Now to see where my suit ran off to."

00:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "When I'm done here, I can bring a Muty 4."

00:11 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Damien, plasma two. Ted, repairs two."

00:12 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Uh, ok I do have a slight problem."

00:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Michael's a two, Katina's a 1.5, so this may not be a good idea."

00:12 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Er."

00:12 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I'll stand step back then."

00:12 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Unless I just don't understand megapods."

00:12 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Blah sleepy."

00:13 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "My active suit is currently at farport! So I might need a few to go get it."

00:13 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I got nothin' below tier five with plasma at the moment, so if ya want plasma from me I'll have ta sell my League."

00:13 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I forget how much influence tier has on pods, I can bring a Muty or AEU 3 though."

00:13 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Ted, Damien, you two know more than me about this, is sticking to low tiers the way to go, or shall we bust out the fives."

00:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What's your low AEU Damien?"

00:14 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I got one AEU an' it's a tier five."

00:14 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I ain't done a megapod in long enough I don't remember what the common wisdom is on tiers fer that."

00:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Same, Damien."

00:15 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'd think it would be the same."

00:16 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Up to you two what we do then. I have a League two, easily could become a three, or a paladin."

00:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm perfectly fine with just trying the high tiers and aborting if shit goes wrong."

00:19 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Back to Muty 4 for me then."

00:19 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Have we got five suits?"

00:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "There'd be my five League and your five I guess AEU."

00:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "So I dunno."

00:20 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I mean five total battlesuits."

00:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh yes."

00:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Then a 2 and a 1.5? Not sure about that."

00:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Like I said, you two can make the call."

00:21 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Or, I could step out, and you guys could do a nest?"

00:22 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We definitely don't have the right suits for that."

00:22 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "For a nest? I was skimming sorry."

00:22 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "We'd still have the tier matching issue."

00:22 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Ah."

00:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Shall we just simplify our lives and do a poacher camp? That might make our lives easier."

00:23 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Yes."

00:23 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "That would work."

00:24 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "So I switching to fringe, or plasma then?"

00:24 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It would indeed."

00:24 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Fringe."

00:24 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "No tier restriction then?"

00:25 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Yup."

00:25 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Got a League an' a repair?"

00:25 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Let's meet at the booth, Michael and Katina went off to pick up their suits from farport so they'll be a couple."

00:25 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Wrong button."

00:25 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You get to be repair, damien."

00:26 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Actually, camp, I can bring Muty 4 or Fringe 5."

00:26 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Fringe five then."

00:31 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Does anyone know what Tesla Spark and Tesla Shield do, and if they are worth the bother?"

00:31 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Ok switching spending buying, give me a moment."

00:33 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station in The Belt of Orion.

00:34 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Does anyone need stuff from surfers?"

00:34 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If your warehouse doesn't have stuff, then we do."

00:34 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "You need to put more core's in warehouse."

00:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Stick a bunch of sheetings in your warehouse probably."

00:34 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Aye."

00:38 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Done and done."

00:38 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

00:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "More to the point, does it get you bigger nests, like as if it's a higher tier, as your GCP goes up?"

00:45 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has contributed to a new League Xenological Battery-Powered Temporary Station in The Belt of Orion.

00:45 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What enemy is stopping to look up your GCP before responding."

00:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The ones that know we what we have and give us different size nests."

00:46 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I've taken rental twos on nests with only tier ones and twos."

00:46 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I have never, as a result, gotten anything other than a moderate or a minor."

00:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They are great when you are fairly low tier."

00:47 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I have done this with GCP at 1000."

00:49 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, it's been ages since I've done anything more than a moderate and I've got over 1000 GCP."

00:49 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Sean Sloan has deposited a fission breeder reactor module (contributed by STAR and SEAS) into an advanced module storage unit from the ship Libertarians Station Transport Alpha.

00:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It seems like only suit tiers matter."

00:50 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Cause of course."

00:50 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Like I said, poachers arn't going to the point center before they respond."

00:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "They're listening to us now and slapping their foreheads."

00:50 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And changing tactics."

00:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It matters most on nests."

00:51 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "They're welcome to head down to the point center."

00:51 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "No, Ted."

01:02 [General Communication] Giovanni Marceli transmits, "Ehy everyone."

01:03 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Heya there."

01:12 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Thanks Erik."

01:14 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Earth lounge for those high tier nests."

01:14 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "High-tier nests?"

01:14 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Are you full?"

01:14 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sadly, yes."

01:14 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I'm still in for high tier."

01:14 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I curse your very existance."

01:14 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Curse it."

01:14 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "He can go if you were counting me."

01:14 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I was not counting you."

01:14 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Are we keeping our same suits?"

01:14 [General Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Oh ok."

01:14 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sure."

01:15 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I mean, how do five person high tiers go?"

01:15 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I don't advise it."

01:15 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Just go with what you got."

01:15 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Alright."

01:18 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "When you're all done with your nest, I will take all of you for grand bari-cleansing of the old frontier processor!"

01:18 [General Communication] Damien Alexander cheers.

01:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I would sadly have to abstain."

01:18 [General Communication] Ted Warburton cheers.

01:18 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Might I suggest a megapod instead?"

01:18 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "All the ground points! Even though we're going to be over by like 1 person or so."

01:19 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You guys can go on a megapod, if you find a fifth. I'm not down for a megapod."

01:19 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But what's wrong with megapods?"

01:19 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The fact that we still have to scout it after like 6 years of scouting it."

01:19 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa chortles.

01:19 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I want to destroy the thing already!"

01:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But for science!"

01:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or something."

01:20 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Will you drink a tube of glowing liquid, too? For science!"

01:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Nicolette already plans to do that."

01:20 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well."

01:20 [General Communication] Bryan Stout chortles.

01:20 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I will learn by observation."

01:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Which is a perfectly valid method of advancing one's knowledge."

01:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Or something."

01:21 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I'm also not very keen on the idea of a Bari head."

01:22 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, technically, you risk a higher likelihood of getting a bari head only if you eat the flesh."

01:22 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Technicalities."

01:22 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Pfft."

01:22 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The tubes are a more extreme method of mutation, often turning you into something completely unrecognizeable, or giving you completely new and random attributes while retaining your original form."

01:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "You're sounding like a salesman."

01:23 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I've seen both from the tube. Eli is a good example of what can be considered a minor mutation from the tube."

01:23 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then there was Adrian, who I think looked sort of like a mushroom and...well, let's not even talk about what happened to Gabrielle."

01:23 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Do you have pictures?"

01:23 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I find myself rather curious."

01:24 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "For science, mind you."

01:24 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na. I was a bit too disgusted at Gabrielle's appearance to take pictures."

01:24 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "How about the mushroom guy."

01:24 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Hmm."

01:24 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I'd have to look. I know I don't have a single photo of him, but he might be in a group one."

01:24 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Who agreed to be in a group photo with a mushroom?"

01:25 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Lots of people!"

01:25 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I mean, I guess it'd hide any flaws with your own face."

01:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow, galaxy buddies is still showing up as an active org?"

01:33 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I haven't seen Akira in at least a year."

01:34 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I saw someone with that name on comms a couple months back."

01:34 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Wow."

01:37 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Sorry."

01:37 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No you're not."

01:37 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I am though."

01:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Why you lie."

01:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You liar."

01:38 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Would blinding have been a valid strategy there?"

01:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yes."

01:38 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Waiting for energy might have helped."

01:38 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Waiting fer yer energy users ta get more than a third energy woulda been a valid strategy."

01:38 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "That too."

01:38 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "I was expecting the crab to die as fast as they do on low tiers..."

01:39 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Crabs suck. Especilaly if you let it get its armor boosting nanites into play."

01:39 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You said it was your first in a Paladin, stop expecting, and start checking."

01:39 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Was partly my doing too."

01:39 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Again, sorry."

01:39 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I need someone to please destroy my wormhole drive."

01:39 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Or wait, hmm."

01:39 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Bah."

01:41 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

01:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:46 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:47 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Well. What abot that time? What would have wrked differently?"

01:48 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "See, this is why you should come on old frontier! You can't really mess up so it's a good practice place. Old frontier woo!"

01:48 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "But then, the AEU government would have access to a mining station."

01:48 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I miss cleaning out Old Frontier. It's been a while."

01:48 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Then again...it's totally possible to mess up on old frontier if you run into vine clusters with bad combinations. Never mind me."

01:49 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The AEu government already has access to a mining station. There's nothing you can relaly do to prevent that."

01:50 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Due to the non-aggression pacts with the other alliances, I do believe that AEU pilots get the resources they mine at their asteroid stations transferred over to the AEU as well. Or at least, large portions of them."

01:50 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "This is something I found out only recently, myself! See? Old pilots odn't know everything."

01:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "There's Glittering Belt anyway, who's is that?"

01:51 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Ours. That's why I said the AEU already has access to a mining station."

01:51 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Sorry, missed you saying that."

01:51 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Why give them a second?"

01:52 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Why give League about three?"

01:52 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "They technically have access to a second, too! And a third! And a fourth!"

01:52 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure, those ones would be slightly taxed, but doesn't mean they count any less."

01:52 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That slight taxation means less credits for Best."

01:53 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Chuckle and ' not by that much."

01:53 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Something is better than nothing."

01:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh are we continuing? I thought you guys launched when I wasn't looking. I wasn't sure."

01:54 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Is it doable?"

01:54 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I'm not really trying to disuade you from your unsound and flawed logic, I'm just trying to tell you that your logic is not really that sound when it comes to the station."

01:54 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Not with three of us."

01:55 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:56 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "That station is better for mining than the other one, right?"

01:56 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Better than the glittering belt that is."

01:57 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Honestly there are several main worths of that station including the mining, to be sure. My star lounge too woo. Let's also not forget though, the upgrades shop. It's got some good low-end and high-end upgrades for newer and older pilots alike."

01:57 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I never quite understood whose idea it was to put an upgrades shop on a mining station."

01:58 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Not having access to this station is inconvenient for Best's government, yes?"

01:59 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Not really, I doubt they care much. It's more inconvenient for the pilots than the government."

01:59 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Otherwise they'd have made more attempts at clearing the place out rather than leaving it up to us for the most part."

01:59 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "These upgrades would not be useful for any other type of ship? The navy or merchants wouldn't benefit from them?"

02:00 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Ather, you still wantin' ta do the cleansing now?"

02:00 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Thanks for coming again, and sorry about how that went."

02:01 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "If so, I'll just switch suits."

02:01 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "The navy and the merchants have never really gotten any of the special-end upgrades that I've ever seen. Not from any of our upgrade shops. Heck, I don't even ever recall seeing any of them with sensor dampeners, but they are home defense forces, usually. Who can know what the patroling navy gets? Also, I very much doubt that the naval and merchant factions get their upgrades from the same places we get them."

02:01 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, I wanna know what suit I oughta bring."

02:01 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "And yes, frontier for sure! Who has EAOS suits they'd be willing to use?"

02:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "My best is Muty 4."

02:02 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I can get plasma on my Muty."

02:02 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I have an EAOS 3 if you have room for me."

02:02 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "We always have glorious room. Damien, Ted, do either of you have repairs with your Mutuality suits? Or can one of you switch to AEU if you have it?"

02:02 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I got my AEU 5 on me right now."

02:02 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "You want me ta bring that?"

02:02 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have microdrones on my AEU."

02:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Why do you have microdrones on your AEU."

02:03 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I think he means on his Mutuality."

02:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Muty even, sorry."

02:03 [General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh."

02:03 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And, because, at tier 4, they are the most effective on that suit."

02:03 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sure, Damien. Bring that. Ted, outfit your Mutuality suit with plasma if you haven't done so already. Constantine...new earth lounge with your EAOS 3. Anyone else?"

02:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Muty without plasma? Is that even a thing?"

02:04 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "At early levels, I believe so!"

02:04 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Been so long since I've operated one. Was never fond of them even in the days that I could buy one."

02:04 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Never done that myself."

02:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:06 [General Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Last call! Anyone else on their way?"

02:21 [General Communication] Bryan Stout yawns.

02:27 392,689.62 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

02:27 You have gained an accumulated 2,225,241.20 credits, approximately, from temporary space station activities.

02:36 Lily Kaise scrambles to her feet.

02:36 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:36 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:40 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Damien?"

02:40 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yeah, Katina?"

02:40 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "What ship were you docking again?"

02:41 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "It'll be my capsule."

02:41 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

02:42 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Alright."

02:44 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "I'll come by with it once we finish at the processor, I'm hoping."

02:45 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "No worries, take your time, just have your ship docked before departure tomorrow."

02:45 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Did ya send me a key?"

02:46 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I did."

02:46 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Cool, thanks."

02:46 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "What is everyone up to?"

02:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi love."

02:57 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] A space station chief technician transmits, "Old Frontier Processor's vents are now relatively clear. Won't last longer than a few days, but we're going off lockdown for now."

03:03 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

03:03 You glance at your communicator's screen.

03:03 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Old Frontier's vents are clear for a day or two. Go drink at the Invaders star lounge, buy the upgrades you need, drink at the Invaders star lounge, mine if you feel like it, but most importantly of all, buy drinks at the Invaders star lounge. [02:03 28 November 2317 GST]

03:50 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:51 Lily says to you, "Just want to figure out how we'll manage with getting to Katina's Carrier and such."

03:52 Lily says to you, "I will load the stuff onto Happy when I wake up and head for Old earth. Feel free to come with or do your own thing but of course be there by 1400!"

03:52 Lily Kaise grins.

03:52 I don't understand that.

03:52 I don't understand that.

03:55 Lily says to you, "We could jsut load up Happy and sleep in there overnight and then when I wake up, I can load us onto Katina's carrier."

03:55 You smile at Lily Kaise. "I think that would be safest."

03:55 Lily Kaise says, "Ok."

03:55 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah because I have a limited time when I can be here around that time of day."

03:56 You nod to Lily Kaise.

03:56 Lily Kaise says, "I'll probably be around between 1030 and 1130."

04:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

04:06 Lily says to you, "Should we head back to the Torus to start getting things together?"

04:06 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:06 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:06 Lily Kaise says, "Ok let's see if I can launch..."

04:06 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:06 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:06 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:06 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:07 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:07 You smile at Lily Kaise.

04:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:07 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:07 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:07 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:07 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:07 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:07 You say to Lily, "As long as I'm here, you can launch."

04:07 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:07 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

04:07 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:07 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:07 Lily Kaise says, "Well when you're not alert, I can't."

04:07 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:07 You say, "True."

04:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:07 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:07 You say, "But I'm alert."

04:07 You smile.

04:07 Lily Kaise says, "Good safety feature for you though."

04:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:07 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:07 You grin.

04:07 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:08 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

04:08 You say, "Yeah, so you can't kidnap me and steal my ship."

04:08 Lily Kaise stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

04:31 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Happy, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

04:31 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:31 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:31 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:31 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:31 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

04:31 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:31 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:31 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:31 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:31 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:31 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Happy! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

04:31 Lily Kaise closes a small package.

22:30 You peer out...

22:30 
[Nouveau Quebec; Docking Bay]
Noise, light, and a faint aroma of warm maple syrup greet visitors to this large docking bay. People wander around, some, including technicians and mechanics, tending to the usual business with starships, but others are apparently merely congregating in order to gossip, scrutinize passersby, and exclaim about bees. The bay itself is a large hexagon some 200 meters across, with immense airlock doors to space on the southernmost side. The walls are a clean dark gray, but the unusually high ceiling overhead is painted a soft blue as if in imitation of a planetary sky, with an enormous royal blue and gold fleur-de-lys in the center. The squarish contours of the bay are softened by the addition of support struts in the corners, each one containing elaborate ironwork. Over the entrance to the access corridor to the north is a large blue and gold banner reading: 'Bienvenue au Nouveau Quebec, Terre du Sirop et de la Poutine.'
The four-person light carrier "Distant Wanderer" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a large pile of snow, and an enticing cloud of bees here.

22:30 [Starship "Distant Wanderer"; Control Room]

22:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Nouveau Quebec; Docking Bay.

22:34 [Starship "Happy"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A small rectangular transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. There is not really enough room for anyone to comfortably stand here; there is only room for the pilot's chair and the controls arranged around it. Most of the space aboard the small shuttle is dedicated to cargo. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Distant Wanderer"; Docking Bay.
You see a glossy sapphire blue ceramic felo chow bowl, Meow the little calico CatBot, a soft oval mauve rug with a luxuriously deep pile and thick gold fringe, an overstuffed sofa upholstered in brilliantly colored patchwork fabric with a soft sky blue brocade pillow with thick gold fringe on it, KitCat the humanoid service robot, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.

Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.

22:39 [Nouveau Quebec; Independence Plaza]

22:39 Built on a grand scale and able to accommodate a great crowd of people, this spacious octagonal plaza is a memorial to life in Old Quebec. The straight sheets of metal used in the station's basic construction are evident in the blocky contours of the walls and ceiling, but painted over them is an engaging mural of an old city with a blue sky overhead dotted with puffy white clouds. In the corners of the plaza are stands of trees from Old Earth protected by elegant fences of black ironwork, and standing tall in the center is a large metal statue with a bench encircling its base. Visible through tall arches to the north and south are wide corridors, while to the east and west are smaller, somewhat less crowded plazas. Popular businesses open here are a bar named 'Au Joyeux Caribou,' a small shop called 'Les Souvenirs,' another named 'La Boutique des T-Shirts,' and yet another displaying boots and shoes in the shop window, where a sign reads: 'Chaussures de Danse.'

22:54 [Nouveau Quebec; Church District]

22:54 Surrounded by an arch of imposing size and design on the west side of this area, the entrance to La Vritable Eglise du Nouveau Quebec seems designed to impress and inspire. The doorway itself seems to be made of highly polished maple wood carved in a Gothic style with the images of angels and saints, some of them unfamiliar. Images of other holy people, among them the present pope of Nouveau Quebec, are painted in murals across the walls and around the entrances of other high church offices here, including the Sainte Office Du Trs Saint Pape and of the Ministre des Affaires Religieuses, while the ceiling is decorated with an interpretation of God's creation of man. Metal benches are set out around the spacious area, a resting place both for the weary and for those seeking a moment of quiet introspection.

With displays of everything from vivid free-form paintings covering the original gray metal walls to fantastic towering paper-based statues and elaborate metal sculptures, this open-air representation of the most avant garde of artistic expression draws locals, some of whom seem quite loudly indignant at this waste of their tax credits, while others gaze fondly upon the creations of their favorite artists. Still others seem to be here merely on their way to somewhere else. The entrance to the Ministre de la Culture is here, its artfully decorated doorway surrounded by brightly colored notices.

22:54 [Nouveau Quebec; District of Culture]

22:54 A great celebration seems to be going on here! Beneath colorful banners and streamers hanging beneath a ceiling painted with a stylized night sky lit by colored lamps, masked and costumed people have gathered here for a party. People dance and parade around in glittery costumes, while an equal number of onlookers ooh and ah from the safety of the painted sidewalks. A number of shops are open along the wide corridor, their doorways situated among bright, glittering murals of fantastic subjects. One such shop is called 'La Tuque' and is surrounded by painted pictures of floating hats, and another is decorated with beautiful masks and has a sparkly gold sign overhead reading: 'Le Masque.' Yet a third doorway is framed with a shiny deep blue arch and has an engraved plaque on the door reading: 'Chic Resto Pop.' Meanwhile, in competition with more established stores, several small tents have been set up, among them 'La Joie de Chapeaux!,' 'Le Petit Mange,' 'Boules de Neige,' and 'L'Animal Sauvage.' Great piles of artificial snow have been heaped up along the walls and tents like snow drifts and seem to be among the most popular attractions here.

Images of other holy people, among them the present pope of Nouveau Quebec, are painted in murals across the walls and around the entrances of other high church offices here, including the Sainte Office Du Trs Saint Pape and of the Ministre des Affaires Religieuses, while the ceiling is decorated with an interpretation of God's creation of man. Metal benches are set out around the spacious area, a resting place both for the weary and for those seeking a moment of quiet introspection.

22:58 This spacious plaza resembles a public museum celebrating the history and culture of Nouveau Quebec. Glass display cases are set up around the area, and historical murals are painted in faded colors on the walls. The ceiling is painted in the likeness of a grand indoor dome with panels of multicolored glass surrounding a huge blue and gold fleur-de-lys. A cart vendor loudly calls out to passersby to sample the deliciousness of his officially sanctioned maple-flavored ice cream, adding to the generally high noise level in the plaza. Engraved into the curve of the arch leading east toward the center of the station are the words: 'Je me souviens.'

22:58 This wide corridor serves as a showcase for Nouveau Quebec's artist community. With displays of everything from vivid free-form paintings covering the original gray metal walls to fantastic towering paper-based statues and elaborate metal sculptures, this open-air representation of the most avant garde of artistic expression draws locals, some of whom seem quite loudly indignant at this waste of their tax credits, while others gaze fondly upon the creations of their favorite artists. Still others seem to be here merely on their way to somewhere else. The entrance to the Ministre de la Culture is here, its artfully decorated doorway surrounded by brightly colored notices.

22:59 A great celebration seems to be going on here! Beneath colorful banners and streamers hanging beneath a ceiling painted with a stylized night sky lit by colored lamps, masked and costumed people have gathered here for a party. People dance and parade around in glittery costumes, while an equal number of onlookers ooh and ah from the safety of the painted sidewalks. A number of shops are open along the wide corridor, their doorways situated among bright, glittering murals of fantastic subjects. One such shop is called 'La Tuque' and is surrounded by painted pictures of floating hats, and another is decorated with beautiful masks and has a sparkly gold sign overhead reading: 'Le Masque.' Yet a third doorway is framed with a shiny deep blue arch and has an engraved plaque on the door reading: 'Chic Resto Pop.' Meanwhile, in competition with more established stores, several small tents have been set up, among them 'La Joie de Chapeaux!,' 'Le Petit Mange,' 'Boules de Neige,' and 'L'Animal Sauvage.' Great piles of artificial snow have been heaped up along the walls and tents like snow drifts and seem to be among the most popular attractions here.

Behind the real trees are paintings of a forested countryside where, behind the many maple trees, the spires of tall evergreens appear here and there against the azure blue sky. Citizens and tourists alike stroll along, admiring the scenery and occasionally glancing upward at the sound of trilling bird calls in the trees. The scent of maple syrup fills the air, courtesy of a small cart at the side of the path where maple-flavored treats are sold.

The area below is divided into sealed quadrants, each containing a vast area perhaps a kilometer on each side of maple trees in various stages of growth from seedling to maturity, flourishing in environments mimicking the four major seasons on Old Earth. Though the section now growing in autumn conditions draws the most reverent attention from tourists and citizens of New Quebec alike for its blaze of glorious color, the winter section is crowded with modern machines and warmly dressed technicians overseeing the extraction of sap from the trees.

I don't know exactly where to begin. To ones who are not aware, It all began when I had my heart broken by someone whom I dearly treasured and cherished. People have there own ways of coping when they go under a great amount of stress or pain. When my boyfriend let me go, I did not take it strongly as I needed to. Instead I ran, because that was my way of coping. My way of coping was running away from my pain. The contents of this brief account should further explain that however. And hopefully you will have a better understanding once you have finished reading this. One day I might write down more details of my experience but, as for now I've not the strength. The following pages are what I wrote while I was lost in the rift. Some pages may seem hurried, other reflective, and some I just wrote down my thoughts because I felt scared and alone, and well, as you will read, writing helped anchor a bit of sanity.

23:26 You turn to page Two.

23:26 Katina Faye's Hauntings                                         Page 2

I did something absolutely mad. I ran away because of Ather, someone who I will now admit to myself, sense I am all alone in the rift, that I could've possibly loved. Mel took me away to feng wo to get away from it all. I thought it was going to help me heal, for Feng Wo is very dear to my heart, and I saw it as a comfort haven. I Had lots of friends whom cared about me, that went with me on the trip. And then one day, while we were hanging out in the OBS room, these beautiful birds carrying poutches came and made this circular stone thing, and we thought it was an offering thing. Everybody was offering sorts of things, some offered blood, while others offered shiny things. I offered a lock of my hair at first, but then I offered myself to the rift. I did this because I was teribly sad. and depressed and everything was screaming Ather to me. Mel wanted me to throw away my amulet but I couldn't. and I got overwelmed and offered myself to the rift. I remember going into the control room. I was quite overwhelmed and had an unclear mind. I gazed into the rift and told it to take me. Then an inhuman voice whispered behind my ear and asked, "You offer yourself? I knew I could not part with my amulet, so I would go with it. So I said to the voice, "Yes, my heart is broken. I want to fly away with you." Then the inhuman voice said, "The deal is struck." The next moment, I was no longer in the rift but in a place that is not really
23:26  a place itself. So now I am stuck in the rift. I don't know where I am. This is what I wanted. I am so scared, Will I ever see Mel again? Will I ever see Ali again? I know I have probably pissed so many people off. I imagine them being mad at my disappearance. I'm so scared, I don't know where I am, except that I am in the rift, and I teribly miss Mel, and I hate and want ather...

23:27 
Right so In this riftscape I found myself in some sort of cave, or moonscape, or coral rief, I could not tell. I had this dread that I would be stuck here forever. All that was with me was a wasp. I remember calling out Mel's name, and crying, I was so scared. And then I curled up and slept from emotional exhaustion. I woke up again, with the wasp still there with me. At first I tried making friends with it. I even named it Ritzy, but then I grew mad and tried to punch it. then I tried going after it and it stung me and now everything has changed. I am here in a fountain like thing, and I want that coin in the fountain, but I don't want people seeing me get it though. Wow, I am not completely and utter alone? Bad rift, it lies to me. Or is this my insane mind speaking. I miss ather. I am glad I am away from him, I am glad I am away from everyone. I wish I could stay here forever, or something. Mel would never forgive me. I don't belong there anymore. All because of some stupid heart break...why did Ather leaving me hurt so much?.

23:27 
I am nowhere and somewhere again. There is a cannon. What do I do with a cannon? I remember that before the intity took me into the rift, that we were in a riftscape that had soldiers firing cannons. So I think that I might catch Mel and my crew mate's attention if I shoot it. I shot the cannon, and I attracted attention. I saw people looking at me, is it you guys? I saw your mouthes open, and I felt slightly relieved. Maybe you guys see me somehow. But that wasn't the case. Because the next thing that is happening is that I am being trampled. I feel pain of being trampled. I do not know what I was thinking, it could not be you guys, you guys would never hurt me like this. I thought that maybe it was you guys, and that if you heard my cannon shot, that Yawl opened your mouthes in surprise and got up and started looking for me in the ship. But then you guys probably could not see me so you trampled over me somehow, but that doesn't make sense. So in my bewilderment and trying to make sense of this, I am gone again, and I look up to see that I am in a basement.

I am going mad. I want to kill this bee, but it keeps going out of my sight, it is now on the trunk of a tree, so I am just considering how I will kill it. While I consider, I will write down what happened in the basement. All I know is there was this book I wanted to read. I love books, but this basement frightened me. The book would be old and moldy to read, but I wanted it so bad. But it was dark and cold in the basement. I finally gathered up my courage and made my way across the dank basement. I remember the concrete floor being cold and gritty against my bare feet. Suddenly halfway across the basement, out of nowhere the furnace roared to life with an angry blast of heat. The sound of the roaring furnace almost hid the sound of a door being opened that should've been locked. I think I ran outside? Because the next thing I know is that I am outside, and it is teribly dark again. I see a dark figure step inside. I scream, and when I open my eyes once more, I found myself some where and nowhere again with nothing but a hat. Bewildered, I took the hat and put it on. It was too big, and I found my arms touching something sticky and wet. Then I was sliding out the other end, and someone helped me up. I looked around and I saw a pencil. I've gone mad. It was time to take my wormhole physics exam. But I had not told anyone that I skipped the class. my whole semester. And it was time to take the class. I felt panicked I did n
23:28 ot want to do this, I needed some sort of escape. I was going to fail the test, I had to do something, anything. I grabbed the pencil and stabbed my palm. I closed my eyes in pain, and when I opened them, I found myself here, with this bee that is after me.

While I try to escape this rift scape, I want to write, because it calms my heart and brain. Plus the things I've had to do here is mad. fact number 1. I'm not over ather.
Fact number too, I'm actually in the rift itself.
fact 3, In the end, this is what I wanted. Something to run away with that would distract my mind and brain. I thought feng wo, but am I crazy for thinking that this rift, being here in the rift is distraction enough? I am away from prying eyes, or people, and I am away from the person who hurt me bad.
fact 4, I don't want to leave. At least, I don't want to go back to the pilot core. I am nothing there anymore. What would Mel and nissi think if and when they found out that I've offered myself to the rift? I could not be trusted to be on my own. I don't think I am of any worth to the core anymore. I hope I become a legend or a mistery, because if I go back to the core, or if the rift forces me back to the ship, then I might consider retiring. I feel like being out here is solitude for me. Perhaps I may find my peace out here, if I can escape the rift, and avoid being driven mad by it. Per haps I will be okay out here, wherever I am. Ather certainly probably wouldn't care much if of my absence. Perhaps I will be just some crazy girl who went rogue over a heart break over him. Perhaps I will be a piece of gossip he may speak of to another girl he might be attracted to one day. But I certainly hope not. A
23:29  part of me wishes he will get the news that I've been taken. I know mell has noticed my abscence by now, I am sure she has sent back a message to the QE back at home to tell them of my abscence. I secretly hope that Ather would come out here and save me somehow, maybe knowing something has happened to me will open up his heart again and he will come and save me. I guess he's the only one that could convince me to go back there. But he does not want me, so good luck with that. I guess I still hope he will take me back and he won't shun me. but I don't know. I'd rather stay out here than go back there to a still closed up Ather, and a very angry core. I am sorry for doing this to Mel. I really am. That is something I won't forgive myself for. She did all she could to help me, and I just up and left her, and turned my back on her. But as much as I love her as my bosom friend, something snapped inside of me and I do not wish to go back. Maybe I have gone crazy. Maybe my heart's been broken so much that I want to be like this

Ather, you were worried that the government would not take well to you. You were worried that something would happen to you. Isn't it ironic that you're quite alright, and I am not? If you ever read this some day, I want you to know that I cared so much for you. The best memory was not lying in a hammock with your or sleeping in your arms, yes those were cherished moments and I don't regret them. The best memory was when we were at the Nightshade Cafe. And I was playing the piano for you. I loved your jovial comments about dissecting pianos. I loved your arm being wrapped around my waist. I can still hear the clicking of your optic units well in the memory as you looked around the cafe. You seemed happy and content, and I loved seeing you happy. Another happy memory was when I was sitting in the lounge and I ketp gazing out the window, and you asked what I was thinking, and I blurted out what I was thinking. And then I was too shy to tell you what I was thinking of you. I miss you asking what I'm thinking. Or when you put your hand lightly on my shoulder and asked me "A creddit for your thoughts?" It made me blush and I was touched you cared what I was thinking. I know when I left the lounge your words echoing in my head that you will see me again so that I will tell you my thoughts of you, I was elated and all girlish, like wow he wishes to know what I think of him. Another happy memory was when you took me to 288 and we got to know and learn about each other. I blushed inside when you said you did not like sharing your women, and you winked at me. I remember asking you what your original eye color was, because I was so enamored with you. That was another time, from 288, but every moment spent with you was grand. Also that night when you made me dinner. I remember that if you had your original eyes I could've made you cry. Because you wanted to feel human and experience a happy and wonderful relationship. That was one of the most hopeful moments of my life. It was all grand. Maybe you letting me go because you did not think it was fair for the both of us that you were not always around was the best. Maybe I will learn that some day. But all I know is right now, is that it hurt me deeper than I even knew, when you set me free. Because I waited for you so many times, I did not give up on you. and I guess I felt like you gave up on me. And I felt like it was so easy for you, and it hurt. It hurt because I thought I could love you. I opened up my heart to you, the petals of my heart were tender. And you were like the bee coming to polinate me, but I only got stung. That is so stupid my analogy, seeing as I'm in this riftscape with this damn bee that I've been trying to kill for several hours. Anyways, All I know is I left, because that is what I do. I run away from things that hurt me. I wish I was as strong as you are, and could've dealt better with it. But I didn't. I offered myself to the rift, because I felt too broken and pained to think clearly. I wanted a means of escape. And now I'm here. in the rift, trying to find my way through it. It is indeed rift madness. But I write to try and keep my sanity. And maybe I am going mad, if I think this rift is helping me not think of you so much, or feel the pain anyways. I'm too busy trying to escape riftscape after riftscape. And you are the only person in this galaxy who could convince me back to go to the core. I have probably disappointed Mel, and all the people that cared about me by doing something so selfish. But I don't think I could be okay facing my heartbreak and facing the shame of the core if I go back there. In a way this is rift is my release and prison. I am selfish for saying that the only way that I could probably bare going back there is if you took me back. and I could not ask that of you, so I won't. If you cared at all maybe you would take me back, protect me, and keep me safe. But that piece of goodness is rare. And I'm rambling now. But this is me. If you ever read this one day, you'll know that I cared about you so much, that I'd've rather face the dangers and the unknown than be apart from you. But you cut the string that tied my heart to yours, and I am bleeding, and I am now in the unknown. And it is indeed insane that though the rift frightens me, and it I am lost in it, it has given me so
23:30 me way to cope with the pain of my heart. It distracts me, it makes me focus on my obsticles at hand, if i am ever to find my way out of the rift. I hope you all will forgive me one day.

23:30 Trilling bird calls fill the corridor, accompanied by the rustle of leaves high up in the trees.

I punched the bee, or tried to. But I felt the pain of the impact on my fist against the bark of the tree, then a stinging sensation in my hand. I unclenched my fist, and found the bee there. To my horor the angry bee flew out and dove at me and sstung me everywhere, into my shirt, arms, all I felt is pain from it stinging me. I wanted it to stop. I close my eyes and cried.
Several people strolling by look up as the birds chirp high above.

23:34 
I cannot tell where I am. All I know is that there is a box with red stains at the corner of the box, and it's upside down. There's a thing, a ghost inside it. I'm teribly afraid. I know it wants to hurt me. There is someone here, he is my friend I think. He wants to flip the box over, but I don't want him to. I can't explain why, it's just a feeling, and he mustn't overturn the box. While I wrack my brain on how to stop him from opening the box, all I can do is just shoot him warning glances, and shoo him away from it, in hopes he will not change his mind soon. My brain hurts. There is a knife here, I must stop him with it. I just don't know how, I don't want to hurt him, though I can't say I have not tried. Rift madness. This is my third day in the rift. I wish Euclid was here. I wish I had his brain. I'd never give it back. Rift madness.

I've done it. I stabbed my friend, it was the only way?. I did not want him to flip the box. I stabbed him once more, and he got his knife and stabbed me back. Lots of pain, lots of stabbing each other. Guess the ghost didn't have to do a thing to hurt me. I collapsed. I opened my eyes, and I still could not recognize where I was. There was a dog, it was very wary it was growling, but I knew it was not upset at me. I wanted to calm it. I reached out to soothe it. It stopped growling. But as soon as I touched it, it exploded into action and tried to attack me. Some unseen force pushed at my back and pushed me to the ground and the dog leaped over and went into combat with the force that I could not see. I fainted. I wake up. Now I am in a starship or something. All I know is I'm moving towards a planet or some sorts, and I can't..I can't move to the controls. Too many things in the way. I have to stop moving somehow, I'm moving fast and it's horid to watch the thing on the view screen racing towards me.

I faced a couple more things after that. I remember smiling in disbelief or for some reason, and saw black, white, then red all over. And then consciousness returned, because I looked up and saw that I was at Outland City
Nightshade Coffeehouse. So I was out of the rift, I hoped. but I was so unsure and shaken. I remember looking around, and was surprised. This was the place where I had the best memories, this was the one place where I had the happiest moments. I remember trying to call Eli so that I could go to Accord and send a message, but could not find my phone, and remembered that I forgot to put it on after I took a shower in Mel's ship. So I called out over general for Eli, and people cheered and asked me if I was okay, and they seemed so happy that I was back safe. I felt so emotional and touched then. But I wondered if they would still react that way if they knew that I had done all of this to myself. I was still so afraid. I went to accord and everything was so familiar and I was so shaken. People came to the QE chamber to aprove my message. I could barely speak, everyone was being so kind and gentle to me. A few days later I told Erik everything that happend to me. and I was so surprised that he did not think lesser of me for doing something so wreckless. I was still surprised that he still cared. I was pretty sure that I would be looked down on. For the first time then I did not feel so alone. I knew that I h
23:35 ad to tell others the truth though, so that is why I have written this book, because at least my crew mates deserved to know what had become of me. I told Mel that happened, and again I was very startled to see that she did not turn her back on me, or scoff at me for my stupidity. It has left me touched and contrite, and I cannot explain how much it means to me that both Erik and Mel did not turn away when they found out the truth.

I went to Aisling's party. It was hard, for I did not want to be there knowing that they were rift intities the faeries. But I gave them the amulet as an offering, what I should have offered to them on the cairn.

List of things I know.
1 I am still trying to cope with everything that has happened to me.
2 I know I have worried so many people, and I am teribly sorry.
3 I don't think that all of this was worth over a boy.
4 I will never do something so wreckless over a boy again
5 I believe that the rift has taught me a lesson despite what I went through. And that is, never to run from fear and pain, but to face it. All I knew in the rift was fear and pain, but it let me go at Nightshade cafe, where I had the happiest moments. So maybe, if I face my fear and pain, I will find happiness? We went to feng wo because I could not face Ather's seemingness to be alright after letting me go. I wanted distance from him, and the pain of the heart break I was feeling. I did not think it was wrong to go away to a comfort haven, in belief that it would do me some good. However offering myself to the rift intity was wreckless and was not the best idea, and was not an escape from the pain I was feeling. I was overwhelmed and was not thinking clearly and I just wanted some sort of escape. Though I am surprised that the intity did not choose the ones who did offer their blood instead of me. I guess it was interested in what I had to offer the most.

23:37 
In closing I would like to say that, I do not think that what I went through in the rift is a common thing. I believe it was a personal experience, so I cannot say how to deal with it, if one was ever taken into the rift, because you guys might face something completely different than I have. My advice is to not be stupid and wreckless like I was, and offer yourself to the rift. That is all I know how to tell you to face it. I was not forcibly taken, I offered myself. Which is a bad idea in my opinion sense you have read of some of the things I went through durring that time. I believe I encountered a bad faery or rift intity that fed off of my emotions and amplified it, but I also believed that it was trying to teach me a personal lesson. Hopefully you will never feel so low like I did enough to do something so wreckless. Lastly I was given permition by Mel to share the account that she had written of what happened with them after I vanished from the ship. On the following page is her account.

On October 24, 2317, we were flying through the rift out heading for Feng Wo. These bird creatures appeared and began to build a stone cairn in the observation room of Nocturnal Flight. Once the birds left, pilots began to put stuff on the cairn trying to get some communication. We offered trinkets such as rings, hair, shiny objects. We felt some sort of deja vu when we first held the stone that's on top of the cairn and it was warm. Nissi felt like she missed something when she held it. Thus we wanted to know the meaning of the symbols and purpose of the stones. Since it was Katina who came up missing, I should mention that she placed her hair on the cairn and asked if she could have it back if it wasn't taken.
The stone cooled off, Nissi said something about people should bleed into the cairn. Damien Goss, Magnus Branderson, Moris Corlew, Wendy Arroyo, and Katina Faye didn't realize she wasn't serious and offered to do it. Nissi decided to go get supplies after, I think, Magnus asked for a knife. I think this was so that, if people were going to do it, it would be safer, Damien and Magnus sliced their arms and bled into the bowl. Morris Corlew, then went off for about 5 minutes to make sample containers so that they could just be placed on top of the bowl if people wanted to prick a finger for blood. In retrospect, allowing two pilots to do the bloodletting into a bowl was a bad idea and I will assume responsibility for this as it is my ship. I believe that, since we don't get many chances to possibly learn something about rift entities, we acted quickly as there is not always time to wait around for a proper science team to investigate.
It was after Morris left to make sample containers that a face was seen in the trench wall of a war scene from the rift. Katina Faye exited the observation room at that point. We soon discovered she was not aboard the ship. We then notified home and stopped in at Feng Wo and asked after her. We had no luck there and headed into the rift for clues. We were asked by someone at the Accord how she disappeared and what our plan of action was, to which we responded that she walked out of observation and just disappeared, and that our plan was to look around Feng Wo space for any clues. We had discussed that we may have to head home and attempt to discuss this with EAOS if we did not find any clues fairly soon.
In regards to the Feng Wo stop, on October 25, we asked a representative there if they had seen her. She was given a photo and they did put up a missing person poster for us. After that is when we decided to go back into the rift and the hallucinations occured.
On the 26th, myself and other pilots had some visions of probably our inner thoughts. It began with Morris seeing things moving and photographs staring at him. At one point, a box of alcohol a crewmember had brought aboard tipped and a bottle of absinthe rolled across the floor to land at his feet. most Everyone who drank the absinthe had some sort of vision, Morris saw an overturned cardboard box and a knife in a photo, I spoke to what I believe to have been my subconscious, Wendy spoke to an aquaintance she met recently, and Tobias spoke to an unknown person, although it appeared to us that he was speaking to another crewmember. From these, we deduced that Katina was hiding as she initially wanted to do and that she had to fix whatever the rift did to her by not wanting to hide. Or we'd need to find some clue as to how we could help her.
While I don't know everything the other pilots heard or saw, with my hallucination, I theorized that Katina was where she wanted to be. That she was hiding and some crazy way, got assistance from the rift. Thus we tried to relax in case she somehow was still near and continued to look and hope till we saw her on comms. Prior to that, we were just all frantic with worry.
After the hallucinations, we had a discussion and deduced the following. The box was a symbol of her hiding, alone and the knife was that of the box needing cut open. Meaning, we needed to try some tough love to get her to snap out of this behavior of running and hiding because it just isn't healthy. These things coupled with myself saying she is where she wanted to be helped us piece this tough love thought together. There was something in Wendy's halucination a
23:38 bout we are not searching for the right thing. We have the answers with not the right questions. So we had discussed these things and came up with our thoughts on how to handle it going forward. Which, I have stated.
My halucination was as follows. I said to myself that I am tired of having to explain everything to these pilots, even if I am right. That they need to learn things for themselves and I am tired of being mom. This was the reason that I deduced it was my conscience because I am probably helpful to a fault. I believe that I asked myself, after saying oh wow or something, where is Katina. I then got the answer that she is where she wants to be. From conversations I had with her prior to her disappearance, I knew she wanted to run away and hide when problems or her love life drama became too much for her to handle. I had tried to explain to her that she cannot continue running and then this rift disappearance happened several hours later.
On the 27th, we noticed that Katina was showing up at home on the communicator. She sent us a QE that she was safe. Since we were close to the Buddha, we decided to stop there before returning home. We described the things that happened to a few of the workers out there. I gave a mostly exact copy of this letter to father Paul and we headed out for home.

23:38 Down the center of this corridor is a painted path of pale orange paving stones lined on either side with young maple trees growing straight and true from wells of soil amid patches of grass along the path. Behind the real trees are paintings of a forested countryside where, behind the many maple trees, the spires of tall evergreens appear here and there against the azure blue sky. Citizens and tourists alike stroll along, admiring the scenery and occasionally glancing upward at the sound of trilling bird calls in the trees. The scent of maple syrup fills the air, courtesy of a small cart at the side of the path where maple-flavored treats are sold.
