00:12 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm not in the mood to take on the bashing."

00:12 You say, "Neither am I."

00:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "However, if we or some of us don't attend then I don't want us coming up short with 'I told you so'"

00:13 You say to a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa", "Doesn't think we should go."

00:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh really."

00:13 You say to Lily, "Ather doesn't want us to go."

00:13 You nod.

00:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "How did you find out?"

00:13 You say, "He said as much over the alliance channel."

00:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh ok well I wasn't listening very attentively."

00:13 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't totally agree though."

00:14 You say, "Well, he said he won't stop anyone from going and we're free to go if we wish."

00:14 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The problem is."

00:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "If we don't attend and we really need others help, then do you honestly believe they will be willing to allow us to work with them and so on?"

00:15 You say, "At this point, I really don't know either way."

00:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Other than their immature bashing, what harm is ther e in attending?"

00:16 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "It happened because most AEU pilots are followers."

00:16 You ask, "Well, if all they do is sit there and bash and take it out on us EAEU pilots, then what's the point in the meeting at all?"

00:16 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "True so that is why I don't totally agree with Ather."

00:17 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Heh Cheri says most AEU are followers. Well League are a bunch of sheep!"

00:17 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "I think is because they stopped building bolts."

00:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.

00:20 You can't go that way.

00:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wow some of those news writers need to learn some basic Esperanto spelling."

00:20 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Anyone have an observation deck they wanna use for this meeting? If not, I probably have a ship we can use."

00:20 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

00:20 You say, "Yeah, definitely."

00:21 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "A what?"

00:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nineteen I gelieve it meant but yeah."

00:21 [General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "An observation deck, like an exploratory ship."

00:21 You nod.

00:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Uh exploratory? How about Exploration."

00:21 You chuckle.

00:21 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs.

00:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I don't want an exploratory anything after me!"

00:22 You laugh.

00:22 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shrugs.

00:22 You nod.

00:22 You say, "I agree."

00:24 You say, "Thing is, even if all these pilots come up with a decision, it still has to be approved by their governments."

00:24 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

00:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes and no."

00:24 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There's nothing stopping them from initiating any fight but yes technically, unless the want to insite war yeah."

00:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Um cause war that is."

00:26 You say, "Unless their government does the same thing our government did."

00:26 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "As in what?"

00:26 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "There's that restaurant."

00:26 You say, "As in, pilots from the AEU wanted to start a civil war and the government grounded you all."

00:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh well doubt that will happen."

00:27 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Okay, we'll be meeting on Reaching for Heaven. If people want to chill in the restaurant for now, though, that's cool."

00:27 You say, "So, what stops the League government or Fringe go government doing the same thing if they decide they're going to go to war against us."

00:27 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nothing because they aren't causing internal issues whereas we are."

00:27 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Why are we meeting on a ship? I'm perplexed about that."

00:28 [General Communication] Brunhilda Schreiber transmits, "It's Tanny."

00:28 [General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Pfft."

00:28 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Did you bolt everything down yet?"

00:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The Fringe have the most to lose though because of our NAP. We have no relations with League or Muguality."

00:28 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "We don't have permission to use any conference rooms."

00:28 [General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Again, I say, pfft."

00:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Mutuality."

00:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Makes sense."

00:28 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "You don't have permission to use a conference room?"

00:28 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Diplomatically, I mean."

00:28 You say, "I know, but still. Attacking another alliance without your goverrnment's approval is never a good idea."

00:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Shut up Sandes and stop running your mouth and showing your abject ignorance."

00:29 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "The EAOS doesn't want to look like they're interfering with our meeting."

00:29 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Meeting on a ship is awkward."

00:29 [General Communication] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "Very."

00:29 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "It's furnished!"

00:29 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Meeting on a ship makes it look like we're trying to hide something."

00:29 [General Communication] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "That's a rather moot point."

00:30 [General Communication] Brunhilda Schreiber transmits, "It really is. These rooms aren't that big and they don't just naturally expand to fit the crowd. Shouldn't have announced this thing before you had all your ducks in a row."

00:30 [General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "It seems pointless to meet on a ship and looks a little what everyone else said."

00:30 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Good have yourselves a big ass argument."

00:30 You say, "Apparently."

00:30 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It also makes sense that the EAOS doesn't wanna look like they're involved in this."

00:30 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "The AEU pilots are stuck on the Torus."

00:30 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."

00:31 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hold on."

00:31 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Correction, many of the AEU pilots are stuck on the Torus."

00:31 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's not about looking like, it's about not wanting to be. Same for many pilots and our alliance governments."

00:31 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah but don't make it clear so you can go and the rest of us can't."

00:31 [General Communication] Brunhilda Schreiber transmits, "How about the strip club on Ixtapa, it's pretty big."

00:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If they change the location."

00:32 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I apologize Mel. My wording was bad because I am not fully awake."

00:32 [General Communication] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "I have no issues with the strip club venue."

00:32 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "That is better wording, Mel. Thank you."

00:32 [General Communication] Kani Kahakai transmits, "You could meet on Hyperion, I think that would send the right message. Also Ciceros has some big tables."

00:32 [General Communication] Larcen Kincaid snickers.

00:32 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It wasn't your wording Eve."

00:32 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "My fault."

00:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:32 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "If you meet on hyperion we won't be there obviously."

00:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "The meeting needs to be where the AEU people can all be involved, but not in a conference room of the EAOS. So a ship makes perfect sense in this situation."

00:33 [General Communication] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "The jazz bar is rather empty, an can accommodate a sizable crowd. Just saying."

00:33 [General Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Can they not take the ITPN? Huh. That's real bad."

00:34 [General Communication] Wendy Arroyo transmits, "Twenty seven minutes to go and still looking for a place to actually meet. You can't see me, but I'm giving a very sardonic thumbs up."

00:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

00:34 [General Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We cannot."

00:34 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "We have a place. People are just whining about it."

00:35 [General Communication] Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys transmits, "Torus restaurant is best place for all meetings."

00:35 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I'd rather not go into someone's ship."

00:35 [General Communication] Cataleya Sandes transmits, "Wow, if Pierre agrees then it is really bad."

00:36 A large semi-transparent perfectly round creature with long dangling tendrils and a violet glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

00:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Not really. I think people mix authority up with experience. We've been around longer and so people look to us for stuff. That doesn't mean that someone who has only been around three months couldn't have a better idea and they should voice it, in the right setting of course."

00:36 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Butlike they said, the EAOs wants to not be involved."

00:36 [General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Well forget that."

00:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.

00:36 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "I would prefer we not do this in the restaurant, but if that's where people want to meet, then that's fine."

00:36 [General Communication] Wendy Arroyo transmits, "I'm sure that won't ruin anybody's dinner."

00:36 [General Communication] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Fine by me."

00:36 [General Communication] Elaine Moreau transmits, "It's not just us at the restaurant. I don't really want to disrupt other people. We tend to get heated."

00:36 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think it should be there so the News Media can rip 'em a new one haha."

00:37 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sorry."

00:37 [General Communication] Wendy Arroyo transmits, "Make sure to tip the wait staff when they throw everybody out."

00:37 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "My thoughts exactly."

00:37 You chuckle.

00:37 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "How about. The person running the meeting just pick a place. And be done. It's your meeting. You decide and stick to it."

00:37 [General Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Yeah, we're using the ship. If you don't want to come, don't come."

00:37 [General Communication] Larcen Kincaid transmits, "In any event, I put on pants for this. An I'm relatively sober and inclined to agree with Eve."

01:35 Lily,
Over the last eight to nine months, I have watched as our careers have gone from being starship pilots to politicians and diplomats. I became a pilot because I loved the stars and not because I love politics. Action after action has either fell on deaf ears or has been rebuked or thwarted by our government. We no longer live under a democracy, but that of a dictatorship. Therefore, before the current political climate destroys the alliance that I love so much, I feel it would be best for me to spend an extended amount of time with my family and the people back home.
I cannot promise or guarantee when I will return to work. Therefore, I cannot ask you nor expect you to wait for me. If you have an opportunity to move on from our relationship, I will be deeply saddened, but it would be unfair for me to ask you to wait. 
Just know this, I love you with all my heart and I am so honored and privileged to have met you and worked with you. Of all of the stars we have seen and been close to, our relationship, our friendship will always be the brightest star in my life. Take care my dearest, most beautiful and wonderful love.
Forever Yours,
Shule Elemmire

Is this okay? [Enter `yes' or `no']

01:36 You write down your message on a sheet of yellow paper.

01:36 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy ruby red ceramic felo chow bowl, 
01:36 a black plastic tray of spider chow, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and gold aquatic life and coral rocks, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a silver holo projector, Purr the humanoid service robot, Sunshine the light yellow long-haired felo, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
You can go south and out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:10 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident, pulling her close.

15:10 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:12 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

15:15 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident whispers, "I'm so glad you are back! I couldn't even sleep in our bed last night."

15:17 Shine the big white glowing felo rubs up against a dark purple leather captain's chair, purring softly.

15:17 You say to Lily, "Awww, I'm sorry."

15:17 Shule holds you tenderly.

15:18 Lily embraces you tightly ... not wanting to let go of you.

15:19 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on the lips.

15:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I just tried to keep my hope that you would come back. I know that these are tough times. It isn't easy to want to push on and to try to overcome our barriers. I believe events will prove different though in time."

15:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

15:20 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Things have just gotten progressively worse over the last nine months."

15:21 You say, "It's one thing not to let you all fly starships, but to stop you from using the ITPN? That just seems extreme."

15:21 Shine the big white glowing felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

15:21 You say, "Even civilians gert to use the ITPN."

15:24 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

15:25 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "By the way Love did you get any mail? I got a mail notification but I obviously can't get it so if it's mail we 'It is as how can we be a flight risk when we can't allow a ship to launch."

15:25 You say, "I don't think so. I'll check."

15:26 You glance at your communicator's screen.

15:26 There are no notices.

15:26 You say, "Nope."

15:26 A medium-sized shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

15:28 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway, the meeting I thought was very productive. Intense but I am totally on board with what the alliances approach is. No, they aren't going to do anything to interfere with our efforts to put pressure on or what Ather may be attempting to do. They are just there saying if they can assist in any manner, they are there for us. I hope the disc wasn't mailed though as I wasnted to let you view it on your own time."

15:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They are pleased with what we did and don't want us to quit."

15:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you on the lips.

15:29 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:29 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident whispers, "I love you."

15:30 You ask, "I'm glad the other pilots are bineg supportive, but honestly, what can you and the rest of the grounded AEU pilots do if you can't even leave from here to even check your mail?"

15:30 You whisper to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

15:31 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a small dusky pink trash bin, a glossy ruby red ceramic felo chow bowl,

15:31 You say, "I have no mail. Nothing was mailed to me."

15:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well for one Once I get it written, I plan to send letters to the Patriot's Party and asking for their assistance. Perhaps they will intervene on our behalf and my thought is if we offer our assistance to them, we can pur appropriate pressure on the maniac Best side or effect what we were actually attempting to initiate this week."

15:32 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Put that is."

15:33 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ather I think is already attempting to do something."

15:33 You say, "It'll have to be one-sided as they won't be able to respond to you. At least, you won't get their responses if they send them via mail."

15:34 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

15:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We probably have other allies in the union out there too. I'm not as aware but if Ather will at least speak with me, perhaps we can at least try."

15:34 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we can get hyperion on our side for one."

15:35 "Problem is, they can't respond to you all via mail." You nod. "It won't be a dialog."

15:36 A short red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

15:40 A long amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

15:46 A small thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.

15:56 A long gold soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

16:00 A medium-sized shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws rears up against the glass and snaps its claws at the outside world.

16:03 Lily says to you, "Just for the heck of it, I'm going to check the ITPN. I doubt I can use it but who knows."

16:04 You nod to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

16:04 You say, "Go for it."

16:05 Shine the big white glowing felo jumps down from your lap.

16:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident kisses you.

16:05 You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

16:05 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh I'll probably be back very soon."

17:50 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
