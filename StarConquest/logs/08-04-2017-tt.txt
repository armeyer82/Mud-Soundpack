Star Conquest is a multiplayer role-playing game set in interstellar
space, as well as on dozens of planets, space stations, and starships.
Your goal is what you want it to be.  There are many different ways to
make a living.  And you won't be alone; all your activities take place
with your choice of three diverse unions as a backdrop.  And when you
finally work your way up to one of the greatest powers in interstellar
space, a fourth alliance of certain humans and some alien species may
begin trying to recruit you.

Scanning reveals that the debris is currently too massive to fit in the ship's
hold.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a ball
of frozen hydrogen.

A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a
defunct sector probe.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a
detached sensor component.

You instruct the computer to begin scanning for debris.
A bit of debris is snagged by the starship's electromagnetic field projector and
slowly brought into the ship's hold.
The debris is now secured in the ship's hold.  Scanning reveals it to be a chunk
of rock and organic materials.
