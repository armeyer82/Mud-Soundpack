00:02 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

00:02 Lily Kaise tickles you!

00:02 Lily says to you, "They are saying it's your feet!"

00:02 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:02 Lily Kaise sniffs at you. You can only wonder what's so interesting.

00:03 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Uh huh he smells like a grassy something 'er other."

00:05 You laugh.

00:05 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I always wash my feet."

00:05 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Every even."

00:06 You chuckle into the PA microphone.

00:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:14 Your stomach churns, and you feel something jerking at your neck, pulling you to one side.

00:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

00:22 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

00:25 You hear a wet tearing sound.

00:28 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

00:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:33 Lily Kaise presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

00:34 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

00:34 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

00:34 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

00:34 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

00:35 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

00:35 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

00:36 Lily Kaise beams at you.

00:36 Melinda Michaels trudges in from the south.

00:36 Melinda Michaels says, "4.2."

00:36 Lily Kaise says, "Woo."

00:36 Melinda Michaels sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

00:36 Ali Candan says, "That means I can go nap now."

00:36 Ali Candan grins.

00:36 Lily Kaise says, "Heh Clarence may say get out of my shop you aEU ***."

00:36 Lily Kaise laughs.

00:37 Ali Candan says into the PA microphone, "Night guys."

00:37 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

00:37 Ali Candan strides south.

00:37 Lily Kaise says, "It seemed I could buy upgrades though when we were out here last."

00:37 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night."

00:37 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Nite Ali."

00:42 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders in from the south.

00:43 There appear to be about 15 pilots recently active.

00:46 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo seems to be hungry.

00:46 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo places its paw on a prominent bar on a felo nutrigel dispenser unit. It begins churning violently for several moments before producing a small glob of nutrigel.
Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo eats some of the nutrigel.

00:50 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders south.

00:51 Melinda Michaels stands up from a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

00:51 Melinda Michaels trudges south.

00:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

01:04 A loud gurgling sound echoes throughout the ship.

01:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

01:14 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

01:35 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo purrs softly.

01:35 Lily Kaise says, "We prob should have brought cheri-pye."

01:35 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

01:36 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

01:37 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

01:37 Lily Kaise says, "I'm just sad that Cheri-Pye has been with us for such a short time."

01:37 You nod to Lily Kaise.

01:38 Sneaky Little Bastard the old large green felo wanders west.

01:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

01:54 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

01:55 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:55 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Well damn hello there rift storm!"

01:59 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.

01:59 A riftstorm appears to be 2.12 light-trade cycles away toward Galactic Westnorthwest and Very Slightly Down.

02:02 Lily Kaise closes a purple silk Feng Wo coin purse decorated with embroidered mystic purple cats.

02:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:06 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

02:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

02:17 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

02:26 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

02:27 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

02:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:37 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

02:37 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

02:37 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

02:45 I don't understand that.

02:45 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

02:49 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:38 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Forward Observation]

03:38 This earthen trench has been dug deep into the ground; the walls are reinforced with wooden beams and stacked crates of ammunition. It has rained recently, and the ground is slick and muddy. An ever-present fog hangs heavily in the air, thick with the smell of gunpowder and death. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a small light blue trash can, a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it, a blue plastic table, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a felo nutrigel dispenser unit, a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a dark metallic red cold beverage machine, a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars, Viviette the violet felo, a small Bari-shaped tidbit, and a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow.
You can go east, south, and west.
(You are sitting on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.)

03:38 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and then you find yourself back in the starship.

03:38 The walls whip away at high speed, carried into the far distance as the floor carries on without them. A darkened hoverfreeway rises from below.

03:38 Viviette the violet felo seems to be hungry.

03:38 Viviette the violet felo enthusiastically gobbles up a small Bari-shaped tidbit.

03:38 Lily shields her eyes.

03:47 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

03:47 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

03:47 The room grows a bit more chill.

03:47 Lily Kaise says, "Was about to say... I'm sure they were charting."

03:48 You nod.

03:48 Every display briefly turns to static as the starship lurches through a turn.

04:47 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

04:47 You say to Lily, "Night."

04:47 Lily Kaise glides out.

04:49 For a brief moment, everything seems to be normal.

04:49 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

05:00 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:04 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:04 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:04 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

05:04 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

05:04 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

05:05 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

05:33 The ever present thrum of the engines changes slightly, and the hull creaks as it begins to turn.

05:33 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

05:34 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

05:39 A klaxon sounds alarmingly and the starship groans in protest as it begins to suddenly drive off a steep shelf.

05:39 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

05:39 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

05:39 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh boy."

05:41 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ouch. 85%."

05:41 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup sure smacks the sensors down."

05:42 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sometimes much worse than others."

05:42 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep."

05:43 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

05:44 The rudder swings slowly with a reverberating groan.

05:44 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

05:44 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

05:45 The mist swirls around the viewports, and when it subsides, you see the starship is back in the riftflow.

05:45 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

05:45 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

05:45 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey not bad!"

05:48 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

05:48 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

05:48 Bursts of multicolored light suddenly blind you as they slice across your view, forming winding pathways through billowing clouds.

05:50 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

05:50 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

05:51 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

05:51 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

05:51 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

05:51 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

05:51 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

05:52 A gust of wind catches the island, sending it off in a new direction.

05:52 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

05:52 The outcropping veers suddenly.

05:52 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

05:53 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

05:53 Suddenly, status lights flicker disconcertingly all around you and something within the ship can be heard to struggle as a pulse of energy is discharged into the ship.

05:53 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

05:53 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

05:53 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

05:54 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

05:54 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
A large metal cube dominates this area of space. From the corners of the station and perpendicular to each side, long metal girders extend into space, each illuminated by red warning lights that reflect from the station's metal plating, giving it an overall dull red glow. A docking bay extends from the spinward side of the station.

05:55 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

05:55 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We are here."

05:55 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

17:23 You peer out...

17:23 
[Tom Town; Docking Bay]
Glaring spotlights in the upper corners of this docking bay illuminate every centimeter of the large rectangular space, casting long pale shadows around the battered starships docked here and the traders, workers, and technicians milling around them. The bay seems to be merely a large metal box built around a framework of massive steel girders left exposed except where hydraulic, electrical, and ventilation systems encased in heavy metal ducts are attached to the walls. Large cables extend across the solid metal floor from massive batteries along the south wall of the bay, snaking toward individual starships. To the north is the massive airlock for docking and departing ships, and to the south is the single airlock for those venturing into the station. The air is cool here, and the gravity is approximately two-thirds of Earth standard.
The galleon "Nocturnal Flight" is landed here.
You see a large metal recycling bin, about a dozen battered-looking docked starships, a woman standing next to a sleek many-turreted starship, a dark-haired woman in a white shipsuit, a blonde woman in a dark shipsuit, a woman standing next to a large cargo hauler, and a red-haired woman in a yellow shipsuit here.

17:23  You are wearing a soft Bahama blue cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

17:23 You are carrying nothing.

17:23 You exit the ship.

17:23 Several tall traders walk past, speaking quietly to each other in a language only vaguely resembling Esperanto.

17:23 [Tom Town; The Cage]
You see a frantic man here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

17:23 [Tom Town; Clarence's Workshop]

17:23 You see Clarence here.
You can go down.

17:23 Clarence says, "Eh? Hullo then."

17:23 
You respond with:

[1] What are you doing?
[2] What's this stuff you're selling?
[3] I'd like to ask you about your station module license.

Enter your selection:

17:24 You respond, "I'd like to ask you about your station module license."

17:24 Clarence says, "Well..... not sure this'll be useful to ya quite yet, but here's th' pitch..."
Clarence says, "Fer the low low introductory price of only two hunnerd an' fitty tael, you can get yerself a license to purchase muh thermal shieldin' technology for yer temporary space stations there. It'll extend the lifetime of th' whole station by somethin' like fitty percent! Whattaya say, chief?"
Clarence stares at you intently.

You respond with:

[1] That seems extremely expensive. I'll pass!
[2] Let's do it!

Enter your selection:

17:24 You respond, "That seems extremely expensive. I'll pass!"

17:24 Clarence says, "Too bad. Lissen.. lemme get you a poster of this module. You can put it over yer bed an' when you wake up you'll remember what yer workin' for. It'll motivate th' fuck outta ya, it will. Lemme jest..."
Clarence begins rummaging around on his workbench for a copy of the poster. After several moments of fruitless searching, he grows distracted with tinkering with electronics and seems to forget you're there.

17:24 [Tom Town; The Cage]

17:24 You see a frantic man here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

17:24 [Tom Town; Airlock]

Damien Alexander, Lily Kaise, Morris Corlew, Kani Kahakai, Wendy Arroyo, and Melinda Michaels are standing here.
You can go south.

17:24 Several workers in bright orange coveralls quietly unload large crates from a battered transport across the bay.

17:24 Damien Alexander says, "Hm, I wonder if I could get rid of some of those engineering tools that don't sell on the market out here. Maybe not today, but some other time."

17:25 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:25 Morris Corlew says, "Depends. Sometimes they go, sometimes they don't."

17:25 Lily Kaise says, "It's hard to say. Sometimes they will take one here and there."

17:25 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

17:25 Melinda says to Damien, "Maybe so. I'll be back this way in a couple months most likely."

17:25 Damien Alexander nods to Melinda Michaels.

17:25 Melinda says to Damien, "Of course you can get out here easy enough."

17:25 Lily Kaise nods.

17:25 Damien Alexander grins at Melinda Michaels. "That too."

17:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe HLV and carrier."

17:26 Lily Kaise says, "They seem to like the trade goods."

17:26 Morris Corlew says, "I was plannin on that."

17:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Split goods."

17:26 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

17:26 Melinda Michaels says, "Or two and not split goods."

17:26 Damien Alexander says, "HLV."

17:26 Melinda Michaels laughs.

17:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah same here i'll need to do a few big trades and I'll be set."

17:26 A small transport slowly rises off the deck and rumbles into place before the airlock. The starship departs to the grinding of the airlock door and the wail of the warning siren.

17:26 Lily Kaise nods.

17:26 Damien Alexander says, "I was thinking about shoving my medium transport in my carrier."

17:27 Lily Kaise says, "It won't fit."

17:27 Damien Alexander says, "That holds almost as much as yer HLV."

17:27 Morris Corlew asks, "Huh?"

17:27 Lily Kaise says, "It's like 160 units I think or more."

17:27 Morris Corlew asks, "Why won't it fit?"

17:27 Morris Corlew asks, "No?"

17:27 Melinda Michaels says, "It will fit."

17:27 Morris Corlew says, "HLV's 84."

17:27 Lily Kaise says, "Oh that one."

17:27 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

17:27 Melinda says to Damien, "Carrier convoy?"

17:27 Damien Alexander says, "My transport's 96 and it fits."

17:27 Melinda Michaels laughs.

17:27 Morris Corlew grins at Melinda Michaels.

17:27 Damien Alexander chuckles at Melinda Michaels.

17:27 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that would work."

17:27 Tall thin people wearing goggles and casual clothing wander from ship to ship, looking over the cargo and speaking quietly among themselves.

17:27 Morris Corlew says, "HLV's smaller'n a medium."

17:27 Morris Corlew says, "But holds nearly 25K more units with a plant."

17:28 Damien Alexander says, "I want that dockin' bay upgrade anyway. Could stick a scout-class in too, if I had that."

17:28 Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

17:28 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Alexander.

17:28 Damien Alexander exclaims, "Short-grain rice! Ya know ya need it! Come an' trade!"

17:28 A low hum issues from the large batteries near the interior airlock then slowly dies away.

17:29 Wendy Arroyo says, "Well, I'm going to chill. Relax. Chillax, if you will."

17:29 Some lights on the galleon "Nocturnal Flight" flash as Wendy Arroyo boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

17:29 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

17:29 Blinking against the bright light, a tall spacer wanders in and enters a transport at the other end of the bay.

17:29 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

17:30 Kani Kahakai puts an expert quickpatch in a white backpack.

17:30 Kani Kahakai says, "I think I've done my exploring too, and it seems like the trades are winding down."

17:30 Lily looks at shule and chuckles and says: hey love do you have 82 golden tael I could borrow?

17:30 Lily Kaise laughs.

17:30 Morris Corlew says, "Heh."

17:30 Damien Alexander chuckles.

17:30 You laugh at Lily Kaise. "Right.."

17:30 You exclaim, "I wish!"

17:31 Morris Corlew says, "I ain't made but just a bit over half that in my career."

17:31 Some lights on the galleon "Nocturnal Flight" flash as Kani Kahakai boards it. They flash again as the airlock closes.

17:31 Morris Corlew grins.

17:31 Lily Kaise grins.

17:31 Lily Kaise says, "Well I've been working on this for nearly 4 years. Of course I've speint some on upgrades and things but it takes awhile. I hadn't traded in quite awhile too."

17:32 You wave.

17:32 [Starship "Nocturnal Flight"; Airlock]

17:32 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, and Melinda Michaels's workbench here.

17:32 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hi."

17:33 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Hi."

19:04 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ten minutes to launch, haul your asses if you want one more trip to the station for whatever the reason!"

19:06 Damien Alexander tramps in from the south.

19:06 Damien Alexander tramps south.

19:07 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

19:07 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

19:09 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Okay then, we're off."

19:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:10 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

19:10 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

19:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

19:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

19:10 Lily Kaise gives you a cool glass of bubbly golden tea.

19:10 Listen. You need to be careful.

19:11 Lily Kaise gives you a grilled egg roll.

19:11 Lily Kaise exclaims, "A snack for you when you wake up! From your nap!"

19:11 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

19:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

19:14 Viviette the violet felo wanders in from the south.

19:18 Viviette the violet felo wanders east.

19:26 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Later Sneaky."

19:29 Minor Change: Trader NPCs who were not inclined to respond to shouted trade offers will now do so anyway after a certain length of time has passed.

19:34 Viviette the violet felo wanders in from the west.

19:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

19:40 They're just using you.

19:42 Viviette the violet felo seems to be hungry.

19:42 Viviette the violet felo places its paw on a prominent bar on a felo nutrigel dispenser unit. It begins churning violently for several moments before producing a small glob of nutrigel.
Viviette the violet felo eats some of the nutrigel.

19:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

19:51 You should keep your room locked while you sleep.

19:54 Viviette the violet felo rubs up against a blue plastic table, purring softly.

19:58 Viviette the violet felo wanders west.

20:01 They stare at you. Of course they do.

20:07 Morris Corlew taps a deck of Horrible People cards.

20:07 Melinda says to Morris, "She is not."

20:07 Melinda Michaels grins.

20:07 Morris Corlew pokes Melinda Michaels in the ribs!

20:07 Wendy Arroyo quickly drains a small canister of de-alcoholized synthol.

20:07 Wendy Arroyo gives an empty can to Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, which accepts it and stores it in a compartment.

20:07 Wendy Arroyo pats Tegan the small circular sanitation bot lightly.

20:07 Morris Corlew shuffles the deck, then deals ten cards out to each player.
Morris Corlew draws a black card and reads it aloud: "The laziest thing that I saw today... BLANK."

20:08 Nissi Valdaire grins.

21:19 Melinda Michaels whistles.

21:19 Damien says to Elaine, "But female pilots can look at the calendar too."

21:19 Nissi Valdaire says, "We're women and we can do what we want. To be told what our bodies should and shouldn't be used for, that's the opposite of feminism."

21:19 Morris Corlew gives Nissi Valdaire a thumbs up!

21:20 Wendy clamps an ancient pack of "BLOK" hazelnut chocolate between her teeth and jiggles it up and down - it doesn't budge.

21:20 Kani says to Wendy, "Try licking."

21:20 Melinda says to Elaine, "Besides, I would imagine if it's something specific people rather not get involved in, they don't have to do it."

21:20 Morris Corlew asks, "Maybe try a microwave?"

21:20 Wendy says to Kani, "It'll be years and years of experience before you can tell me what I should and shouldn't lick."

21:20 Morris Corlew blinks.

21:20 Kumquat the big red felo wanders south.

21:20 Damien says to Wendy, "If ya melted it, you could..."

21:20 Damien Alexander coughs.

21:20 Wendy says to Kani, "That being said, it's probably not a bad idea."

21:21 Kani says to Wendy, "I'm sure I'll get the crash course."

21:21 Wendy says to Kani, "I'm not that bad of a pilot."

21:21 Damien Alexander chuckles.

21:21 Melinda says to Elaine, "For example, some did a photo album of various shots and sold it to raise funds for our community outreach fund."

21:21 Wendy says to Kani, "I might've scraped one of Morris' or Melinda's ships on takeoff, but that was on purpose."

21:21 Morris Corlew laughs.

21:22 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:22 Morris says to Wendy, "Musta been Mel's."

21:22 Wendy says to Morris, "I don't think so, on account of still having kneecaps."

21:22 Morris Corlew says, "I bout scraped Akemi's ship good goin into Accord once."

21:22 Elaine Moreau says, "Yeah, selling your dignity for the benefit of perverts doesn't sound empowering to me. I could have done that to pay for my license, and I didn't. I'm out."

21:22 Elaine Moreau scrambles to her feet.

21:22 Elaine Moreau slinks south.

21:22 Morris Corlew grins at Wendy Arroyo.

21:22 Melinda Michaels shrugs and waves.

21:22 Morris Corlew blinks.

21:22 Morris Corlew says, "Um."

21:22 Morris Corlew says, "Wait."

21:22 Wendy Arroyo frowns.

21:22 Morris Corlew asks, "She thinks it's some requirement or somethin?"

21:22 Damien blinks and stares after Elaine for a moment. "I think she's offended."

21:22 Nissi Valdaire says, "Insults then running out of the room. That's brave."

21:23 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:23 Morris Corlew looks at Nissi Valdaire and shrugs.

21:23 Kani Kahakai says, "I don't think anyone was trying to strong-arm her."

21:23 Melinda Michaels says, "No."

21:23 Morris Corlew says, "Nope."

21:23 Damien Alexander says, "I don't think so either."

21:23 Morris Corlew says, "Sure didn't look it from where I'm sittin."

21:23 Nissi Valdaire says, "Nope. The whole point of it is personal choice."

21:23 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

21:23 Kani Kahakai nods to Nissi Valdaire.

21:24 Melinda Michaels says, "She is missing the point. It may or may not have to do with, um, other things."

21:24 Morris Corlew says, "Guess she didn't wanna argue this time."

21:24 Nissi Valdaire says, "She wanted to argue, just didn't want to hear a rebuttal."

21:25 Morris Corlew says, "Well...yeah, that's more accurate. But often she sits and squints when she hears it."

21:25 Morris Corlew says, "Instead of leavin."

21:25 Nissi Valdaire grins and shrugs.

21:25 Kani Kahakai says, "I mean... she was going on about her catsuit in front of everyone the other day... when she was in a playful mood."

21:25 Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah, she was."

21:25 Kani Kahakai says, "I think just in an argumentative mood today."

21:26 Damien Alexander nods to Kani Kahakai. "Everybody gets that way sometimes."

21:26 Kani Kahakai nods.

21:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sometimes I get a vibe that she's got a personal issue with me but I have no idea what that'd be."

21:26 Melinda Michaels says, "I dunno either."

21:26 Kani says to Nissi, "You're too quiet to have personal issues with."

21:26 Morris says to Nissi, "Well...she seems to have one with me too, so...I dunno. I can't express an opinion differs from hers in any way without her thinkin I'm tryin to argue."

21:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "Just this random combativeness about things I take a position on. Maybe I'm just taking it too personal and she just doesn't handle trips well."

21:27 Morris Corlew looks at Nissi Valdaire and shrugs. "Dunno."

21:27 Wendy Arroyo says, "Said as much, she doesn't take to the rift too well."

21:27 Nissi Valdaire nods.

21:27 Melinda Michaels says, "I will go check on her."

21:28 Melinda Michaels stands up.

21:28 Melinda Michaels trudges south.

21:28 Wendy scratches the back of her neck. "I oughta apologize, too."

21:29 Kani says to Wendy, "Offer to cover her in chocolate?"

21:29 Nissi Valdaire grins.

21:29 Nissi Valdaire asks, "What did you do?"

21:29 Damien Alexander chuckles.

21:29 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, ""
Wendy says to Nissi, "Made it sound like I'd drafted her for this thing or something, I dunno. That's probably what she took offense to."

21:29 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wendy."

21:29 Nissi Valdaire says, "Ohh."

21:29 Wendy Arroyo stands up from a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

21:29 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Come here."

21:29 Wendy Arroyo says, "There it goes."

21:30 Wendy Arroyo wanders east.

21:30 Wendy Arroyo wanders in from the east.

21:30 Wendy Arroyo coughs.

21:30 Wendy Arroyo wanders south.

21:30 Nissi Valdaire says, "Called to the principal's office."

21:31 Morris rubs his beard thoughtfully.

21:31 Morris says to Nissi, "I thought you were the principal."

21:31 Morris Corlew grins at Nissi Valdaire.

21:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "Not on this ship."

21:32 Morris Corlew says, "Oh true."

21:32 Nissi Valdaire says, "Unless she needs me to say nobody's required to pose for naughty photos, then well obviously."

21:32 Morris Corlew grins.

21:33 Melinda Michaels trudges in from the south.

21:33 Melinda Michaels sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

21:34 Morris says to Melinda Michaels, "She ok?"

21:34 Melinda Michaels says to Morris, "Seems to be some misunderstood things."

21:34 Morris Corlew nods to Melinda Michaels.

21:34 Melinda Michaels says, "Maybe joking wasn't taken as such. So I told them to fix it and left."

21:34 Morris Corlew nods.

21:35 Nissi Valdaire says, "I didn't realize what Wendy had said, that explains things a bit. I guess."

21:35 Melinda Michaels says, "She thought she was being asked to fully take it all off and stuff."

21:35 Morris Corlew blinks.

21:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Told rather."

21:36 Nissi Valdaire says, "Weird. The one calendar we did doesn't even have nudity."

21:36 Morris Corlew says, "Nope."

21:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Na."

21:36 Morris Corlew says, "But...Elaine ain't seen it, to be fair."

21:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Well hope they can fix it."

21:36 Nissi Valdaire nods.

21:37 Kani Kahakai says, "I'm sure they can. Just kind of clashing attitudes sometimes."

21:38 Melinda Michaels says, "Such is life."

21:38 Melinda Michaels says, "A good freind of mine and I are great friends till we argue. Man can we argue but it's over with quick."

21:38 Morris Corlew looks at Melinda Michaels thoughtfully.

21:39 Melinda Michaels says, "And when we are in the middle of a huge argument, be damned to whomever tries to pick sides. We'll both go after them."

21:39 Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:39 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:40 Nissi Valdaire grins.

21:40 Kumquat the big red felo wanders in from the south.

21:41 Melinda says to Kani, "You seem to do well on trips, if I may say."

21:41 Damien Alexander strokes the soft fur of Kumquat the big red felo.

21:41 Kumquat the big red felo purrs softly.

21:41 Nissi Valdaire strokes the soft fur of Kumquat the big red felo.

21:41 Kumquat the big red felo purrs and rubs its head against Nissi's hand.

21:41 Morris Corlew says, "Awww."

21:41 Damien says to Kumquat the big red felo, "Check this out."

21:41 Morris says to Kumquat the big red felo, "Gettin all the attention."

21:41 Damien Alexander bounces a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker toward Kumquat the big red felo.

21:41 Kumquat the big red felo bats wildly at the ball.

21:41 Damien Alexander grins at Kumquat the big red felo.

21:41 Damien Alexander rolls a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker across the floor toward Kumquat the big red felo.

21:41 Melinda says to Damien, "They interrupted my chocolate joking. Maybe I'll remember it at Mardi Gras."

21:42 Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:42 Kumquat the big red felo leaps after the ball.

21:42 Damien Alexander rolls a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker across the floor toward Kumquat the big red felo.

21:42 Kumquat the big red felo bounds after the ball.

21:42 Damien says to Melinda, "You gonna cover me in chocolate at Mardi Gras?"

21:42 Damien Alexander grins at Melinda Michaels.

21:42 Damien Alexander bounces a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker toward Kumquat the big red felo.

21:42 Melinda says to Damien, "Wait, me?"

21:42 Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:42 Kumquat the big red felo bats wildly at the ball.

21:42 Damien Alexander giggles.

21:42 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:42 Damien Alexander bounces a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker toward Kumquat the big red felo.

21:42 Kani says to Melinda, "Another admirer?"

21:42 Kumquat the big red felo bounds after the ball.

21:43 Damien says to Kani, "Wait, do I have those?"

21:43 Morris Corlew says, "Mel's admirers are uncountable."

21:43 An arc of light much like a meteor draws itself in the sky overhead.

21:43 Damien Alexander puts a small yellow ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker away.

21:43 Kani Kahakai nods to Morris Corlew.

21:43 Melinda says to Kani, "Highly unlikely. One of us would have tossed the other out a window by now."

21:43 Melinda Michaels grins at Damien Alexander.

21:43 Morris Corlew laughs.

21:43 Damien Alexander glances around at his surroundings.

21:44 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

21:44 Kani Kahakai shrugs.

21:44 Melinda says to Kani, "I am joking."

21:44 Melinda Michaels says, "I think."

21:44 Melinda Michaels grins.

21:44 Morris Corlew grins.

21:45 Melinda says to Damien, "Speaking of windows, got just a sec?"

21:45 Damien says to Melinda, "I didn't bring my squeegee."

21:45 Damien Alexander grins.

21:45 Damien says to Melinda, "But sure."

21:45 Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:45 Damien Alexander stands up.

21:45 Morris Corlew grins.

21:45 Nissi Valdaire grins.

21:45 Melinda Michaels stands up from a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

21:45 Melinda Michaels holds Damien Alexander's hand, taking him into her group.

21:46 Melinda Michaels's group trudges south.

21:47 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

21:47 Lily Kaise yawns.

21:47 Lily Kaise exclaims, "What did I miss!"

21:48 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:48 Morris Corlew says, "Everything."

21:48 Morris Corlew says, "We decided to go Rimward while Mel was sleepin."

21:48 Lily Kaise says, "Aha! Sounds like barrels of fun1."

21:48 Morris Corlew says, "We conquered the Outsiders, pillaged their planets, and now they're our loyal servants."

21:48 Lily Kaise says, "Yup."

21:48 Lily Kaise says, "And steal all their tech."

21:48 Morris Corlew grins at Lily Kaise.

21:49 Kani Kahakai says, "There is a distinct lack of tentacles and base eight here."

21:49 Morris Corlew chuckles.

21:49 Kani Kahakai says, "For having stolen all outsider tech."

21:49 Morris Corlew says, "Oh...Mel didn't like it, so she didn't do any of the new upgrades."

21:49 Kani Kahakai says, "I wanted to go to purple alert..."

21:49 Kani Kahakai pouts.

21:49 Morris Corlew grins.

21:49 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Heh Ather has no Outsider tach in him but yes he has the mentality of an Outsider at times no doubt!"

21:49 Morris says to Kani, "You been on Pierre's ship already?"

21:50 Melinda Michaels trudges in from the south followed by Damien Alexander.

21:50 Morris Corlew looks at Lily Kaise and shrugs.

21:50 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:50 Melinda Michaels says, "Damien has agreed to be coded in chocolate for the cats calendar."

21:50 Melinda Michaels laughs.

21:50 Morris Corlew laughs.

21:50 Lily Kaise chuckles.

21:50 Kani Kahakai looks at Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys thoughtfully.

21:50 Melinda Michaels sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

21:50 Damien Alexander cackles!

21:50 Nissi Valdaire gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

21:50 Melinda Michaels says, "Coated."

21:51 Damien Alexander gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

21:51 Morris says to Melinda, "I told Lily we took your ship Rimward while you were asleep, conquered the Outsiders, pillaged their worlds, and now they're our loyal servants."

21:51 Lily Kaise grins.

21:51 Melinda Michaels grins at Morris Corlew.

21:52 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Phew I hope I don't have to deal with Outsider Patrols ever again!"

21:52 Damien says to Morris, "Did this involve time travel?"

21:52 Morris Corlew nods to Lily Kaise.

21:52 Morris says to Damien, "Sure."

21:52 Damien Alexander chuckles.

21:52 Morris says to Damien, "So...I have this thing."

21:52 Morris Corlew grins.

21:52 Melinda Michaels says, "Speaking of, I'll go make sure my ship isn't about to be blown up or some crazy shit."

21:52 Melinda Michaels grins.

21:52 Melinda Michaels stands up from a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

21:52 Melinda Michaels disbands her group.

21:52 Melinda Michaels trudges south.

21:52 Morris Corlew says, "When folks wake up and ask if they missed somethin on a trip, I always make up some wild story."

21:52 Damien Alexander grins at Morris Corlew and nods.

21:53 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Or just tell them they were sub-cousciously influenced!"

21:53 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:53 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

21:53 Morris Corlew says, "Easy way to bypass the cockamamie story? Read the message boards."

21:53 Morris Corlew grins.

21:53 Lily Kaise nods.

21:53 Kani Kahakai switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

21:53 Kani Kahakai says, "The board is kind of dull."

21:53 Morris Corlew says, "Yep."

21:53 Kani Kahakai says, "I would rather have the crazy story."

21:54 Morris Corlew grins at Kani Kahakai.

21:54 Morris Corlew says, "I never plan 'em ahead, so generally they're pretty wacky."

21:54 Damien stares at Lily and waggles his fingers at her. "Yooouuu are now an AEU pilot..." He stops and drops his hands. "Oh, wait."

21:54 Morris Corlew laughs at Damien Alexander.

21:54 Kani says to Damien, "You shouldn't inflict that kind of hardship on anyone."

21:54 Damien Alexander shrugs helplessly.

21:54 Damien Alexander snorts and grins at Kani Kahakai.

21:55 Damien Alexander says, "I think it's time fer me ta have some kinda nap thing. My brain is runnin' low on power over here."

21:55 Morris Corlew nods to Damien Alexander. "Rest well."

21:55 Lily Kaise asks, "-damien uh yeah you just figured that out?"

21:55 Lily Kaise laughs.

21:55 Damien Alexander grins at Lily Kaise.

21:55 Damien Alexander waves. "Be back later."

21:55 Lily Kaise nods.

21:55 Damien Alexander tramps south.

22:00 Kumquat the big red felo wanders south.

22:01 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

22:02 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys slumps in a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it and goes to sleep.

22:02 Kani shrugs helplessly at the situation.

22:03 The hovertruck spends several minutes overtaking a hovercar. Nobody appears to be in its driver's seat.

22:04 Morris says to Kani, "What?"

22:04 Kani Kahakai says, "People winding down."

22:04 Morris Corlew says, "Ah."

22:09 A clear expanse of open highway illuminates itself. The hovertruck speeds up.

22:09 You're not playing this game.

22:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

22:13 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:13 Kani Kahakai scrambles to her feet.

22:13 Kani Kahakai stalks south.

22:14 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into the darkness.

22:14 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

22:20 Kani Kahakai stalks in from the south.

22:20 Kani Kahakai glances around at her surroundings.

22:20 Kani Kahakai sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

22:20 Kani Kahakai puts a small silver laser pointer with a felo paw marking in a white backpack.

22:20 Kani Kahakai says, "I probably didn't just wander around the ship to play with all the felo."

22:21 Nissi Valdaire grins.

22:21 Morris Corlew chuckles.

22:21 Morris Corlew says, "I'm sure they enjoyed it."

22:21 Kani Kahakai says, "I only found Kumquat. The rest are hiding."

22:21 Morris Corlew says, "Hmm."

22:21 Morris Corlew stands up from a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

22:21 Morris Corlew mosies south.

22:21 Morris Corlew mosies in from the south.

22:21 Morris Corlew says, "Meh."

22:21 Morris Corlew mosies south.

22:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:22 Morris Corlew mosies in from the south.

22:22 Morris Corlew says, "All I found was Sneaky."

22:22 Morris Corlew sits down on a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

22:24 Kani Kahakai says, "Maybe not so sneaky."

22:24 Nissi Valdaire grins.

22:24 Morris Corlew says, "Well, he's hidin behind Athena's cage. Almost didn't see him."

22:25 Nissi Valdaire says, "I don't even know where my lizard's cage is."

22:25 Lily Kaise pats a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria' lightly.

22:25 Nissi Valdaire says, "Or my lizard for that matter. Somewhere on this ship. I hope."

22:25 Lily Kaise says, "Get her a snuggly."

22:25 Lily Kaise grins.

22:25 Morris Corlew says, "Dunno. I know Isis's and Athena's are both in Mel's storage."

22:25 Morris Corlew nods to Nissi Valdaire.

22:25 Kani Kahakai says, "She was in my quarters when I woke up this morning."

22:26 Nissi Valdaire grins.

22:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I saw those made me sad."

22:26 Kani Kahakai says, "Watching, waiting."

22:26 Morris says to Kani, "To lick your ear when ya least expect it."

22:26 Kani Kahakai asks, "If I don't ripen soon I might end up getting eaten, that's how Tardics work, right?"

22:26 Morris Corlew grins.

22:26 Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."

22:26 Kani Kahakai shrugs.

22:26 Lily Kaise says, "Absolutely."

22:26 Kani Kahakai says, "Well they're warm."

22:26 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:27 Kani Kahakai says, "So."

22:27 Kani Kahakai gives an enthusiastic thumbs up.

22:27 Lily Kaise says, "Naa Lizards are not aggressive."

22:27 Morris Corlew says, "Ather claims Skipper is."

22:27 Lily Kaise says, "Heh right."

22:27 Kani Kahakai says, "It sounds like Ather claims a lot of things."

22:27 Lily Kaise says, "Well if he is then Ather made him that way."

22:27 Morris Corlew grins at Kani Kahakai.

22:27 Nissi Valdaire says, "They don't even bother felo. Unless you offer one right up to them."

22:28 Lily Kaise nods.

22:28 Morris says to Lily, "Nah, he says it was fore he got him."

22:28 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm ok."

22:28 Kani says to Nissi, "Why would you do that?"

22:28 Morris Corlew says, "I dunno. I decided not to cross him on it."

22:28 Morris says to Kani, "Ask Ather."

22:28 Nissi Valdaire looks at Kani Kahakai and shrugs.

22:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "I haven't."

22:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "Ather did though."

22:28 Kani repeats hauntedly "Why would you do that."

22:28 Lily Kaise says, "Well when you feed them. Ather has fed old felo to skipper."

22:28 Nissi Valdaire says, "Performative masculinity."

22:28 Morris Corlew says, "He's...well. He's got somethin wrong upstairs."

22:29 Lily Kaise nods.

22:29 Kani says to Morris, "All that extra hardware."

22:29 Morris Corlew looks at Kani Kahakai and shrugs. "War stress. Who knows."

22:29 Lily Kaise says, "And the other missing stuff."

22:29 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

22:35 Kani beams at a Tardick lizard named Asteria on Lily's shoulder.

22:35 Melinda Michaels trudges in from the south.

22:35 Lily Kaise smiles.

22:35 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

22:35 Morris says to Melinda Michaels, "Hey."

22:35 Melinda Michaels nods.

22:35 Kani says to Melinda, "Welcome back."

22:35 Lily Kaise says, "I got her at Tom Town about guess it was two years ago."

22:36 Morris Corlew says, "I think that batch of lizards is the last we've seen."

22:36 Kani Kahakai says, "It sounds like nobody has traded for one in a really long time..."

22:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, I am gonna just go sit in the control room. I need to, count or something."

22:36 Lily Kaise nods.

22:36 Morris Corlew nods to Kani Kahakai.

22:36 Morris says to Melinda, "You alright?"

22:36 Kani says to Melinda, "You? Numbers?"

22:36 Melinda Michaels says, "Always."

22:36 Melinda Michaels trudges south.

22:36 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah we keep looking out for one for shule but just isn't happening."

22:36 Morris Corlew frowns.

22:36 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:36 Nissi Valdaire gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:36 Morris says to Lily, "Been two years since the last one."

22:36 Morris Corlew stands up from a silky dark blue cushion decorated with embroidered silver stars.

22:37 Morris Corlew mosies south.

22:37 Nissi Valdaire scrambles to her feet.

22:37 Nissi Valdaire walks south.

22:38 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:38 Kani Kahakai says, "I hope Mel is okay..."

22:38 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah..."

22:39 Kani Kahakai says, "I don't want to crowd in if something is wrong."

22:39 Lily Kaise nods.

22:39 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

22:39 Kani Kahakai says, "Being the new girl is complicated."

22:39 Lily Kaise puts a Tardick lizard named Asteria in a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

22:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

22:39 Lily Kaise says, "Be right back."

22:39 Kani Kahakai says, "Awwwwww~"

22:40 Lily Kaise says, "Yep nap time for her."

22:40 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:40 Lily Kaise glides south.

22:41 Kani Kahakai gets a distant look on her face as she ponders.

22:41 Kani Kahakai scrambles to her feet.

22:41 Kani Kahakai stalks south.

22:43 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

22:44 Lily Kaise glides in from the south.

22:44 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and strawberry red paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

22:44 Lily Kaise says to you, "Don't spill your tea I gave you a snack!"

22:44 Lily Kaise grins.

22:45 Kani Kahakai stalks in from the south.

22:46 Kani Kahakai sits down on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it.

22:46 Kani Kahakai draws her legs up on a large leather couch with a hand-made sapphire and blue star quilt on it and frowns pensively.

22:47 Kani Kahakai begins is curled in a seated position with her legs tucked under her, on the couch.

22:47 Kani Kahakai begins curled in a seated position with her legs tucked under her, on the couch.

22:53 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

23:03 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

23:06 Kani figets.

23:07 Kani fidgets too.

23:13 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

23:15 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

23:15 A high pitched whistling sound screams overhead as a mortar shell flies through the air. It explodes nearby with tremendous force, and when the dust and smoke clears, the starship is gone, replaced with a deep earthen trench and the sounds of battle.

23:27 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Kani?"

23:27 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Come on back in if ya want."

23:27 Kani Kahakai stalks south.

23:41 An allied biplane flies overhead, strafing the battlefield with a hail of machine-gun fire.

23:46 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys suddenly awakens.

23:50 Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys says, "Always forward."

23:51 Two medics carrying a stretcher run by. The soldier on it has a bloodied and mangled stump where his right arm once was.
