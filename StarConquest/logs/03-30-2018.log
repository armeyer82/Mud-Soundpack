00:48 The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.

00:58 The low-droning of an alien insect fills the air.

00:59 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

00:59 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

01:29 It feels as if something is trying to force its way out of your skull.

01:39 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

01:50 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

01:57 The stage lights flicker briefly.

02:02 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

02:02 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

02:02 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Who's up?"

02:32 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

02:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

02:40 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

02:40 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:42 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

02:42 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

02:42 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

02:43 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

02:44 Lily Kaise absently sniffs at the air.

02:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

02:56 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

02:57 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "How goes?"

03:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

03:02 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

03:02 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

03:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

03:12 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

03:13 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Beep beep."

03:13 The ship jerks slightly as the ant carrying it turns abruptly to avoid marching over a stone.

03:13 The ship tilts backward and seems to hang in midair as it is slowly carried over an overturned tree.

03:13 The hull creaks and buckles as another ant grasps the ship in its mandibles, taking control of carrying it in a new direction.

03:14 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

03:16 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Might need to adjust the heading!"

03:17 The hull creaks and buckles as another ant grasps the ship in its mandibles, taking control of carrying it in a new direction.

03:17 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

03:17 The ship jerks slightly as the ant carrying it turns abruptly to avoid marching over a stone.

03:20 The ant procession moves along more quickly as it heads down a slight hill.

03:21 The pace of the ants seems to quicken suddenly and the wobbling of the ship becomes more noticeable.

03:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:27 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Closing in!"

03:27 Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah."

03:28 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

03:28 A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

03:28 Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

03:28 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hot."

03:28 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

03:28 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:33 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

03:44 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:44 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:44 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

03:44 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

03:48 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

03:49 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh."

03:50 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hm?"

03:50 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh just being..."

03:51 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "790 light-years to go, for the record."

03:51 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Just?"

03:51 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, we've made really good time in the past twenty four hours."

03:51 Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I can travel them in like 6 hours max."

03:51 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well that's pretty decent as we did travel a goodly distance then."

03:51 Alko Delovega's voice comes over the loudspeaker as he laughs.

03:51 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Er wait."

03:52 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I really couldn't keep very good track on this trip so how far did we actually manage before we decided to turn back?"

03:54 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We hit the Outsider patrol at about 7% NDB."

03:54 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh right."

03:54 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And have been heading back since, due to battery more than anything."

03:55 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah understand as all of that yellow killed our extra charge but beats the alternative."

03:56 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's been a productive trip. There's a nice collection in the box in there."

03:57 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I also so appreciate coing along. I just wish I could be more available but your crew is awesome Keegan. I appreciate too the opportunity to have gotten a change of routine for a bit."

03:58 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Cheers."

04:06 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

04:07 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Good day everybody, it's time for me to waste a cycle and a half or so of precious time on sleep. Fly safe!"

04:08 Lily Kaise pulls a pair of mystic purple suede clogs off of her feet.

04:08 Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

04:08 Lily Kaise puts a pair of mystic purple suede clogs in a small suitcase.

04:43 Lily says to you, "Nite."

04:43 You say to Lily, "Night."

04:44 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

04:45 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

04:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

05:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:14 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

05:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:25 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

05:35 A boiler shudders loudly as you pass it, steam venting around the bolts which hold it together.

05:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

05:39 You hear a loud bang, and the conveyor belt slows.

05:47 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

05:47 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

05:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:56 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I live!"

05:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

06:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:17 A small vehicle pulls alongside, kicking up dust, before speeding ahead.

06:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:27 A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.

06:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:48 A truck on a converging path swings onto the main road just ahead of the ship.

06:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:49 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

06:50 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

06:57 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

07:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:05 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Woo."

07:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:19 The skeletal remains of dozens of humans tremble and rattle below.. The ghastly creatures reform and stand, reaching toward the edges of the platform with gnashing teeth and glowing red eyes.

07:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:30 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

07:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:41 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

07:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

07:51 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

07:52 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

07:52 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

07:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

08:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

08:22 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

08:32 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

08:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:43 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

08:45 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

08:52 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

08:52 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

08:56 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:44 You hear several clanging noises coming from the starship's interior.

09:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:54 The ship's floodlights illuminate a deep sea coral reef, filled with orange and purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.

09:54 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

09:54 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

10:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

10:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

10:44 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

10:55 A strange, impish creature flies overhead with black leathery wings.

10:55 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

10:55 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

11:25 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

11:35 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

11:37 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

11:37 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

11:38 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

11:49 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

11:56 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

11:56 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

11:56 The breeze abruptly changes direction, causing the tall grass to stir slightly.

11:56 The breeze calms and the rustling grass eases.

11:57 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

12:31 The breeze abruptly changes direction, causing the tall grass to stir slightly.

12:31 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

12:31 Bits of starships of alien design and other assorted junk litter space in this area. Oddly, judging from some of the debris that the ship can detect in the distance, this was the site not only of a naval battle but of some sort of space-based infantry engagement.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

12:31 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

12:32 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ever been to a field like this, Gonzales?"

12:42 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

12:43 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Do you want to grab that artifact, Gonz, or neg?"

12:46 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

12:46 Lily Kaise glides out.

12:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

12:47 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

12:47 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

12:51 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is there a reason we're artifacting here?"

12:51 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Grabbing a souvenier for Gonzales."

12:51 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "As it's his first trip, pretty sure."

12:51 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Back."

12:52 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Na, its fine."

12:52 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

12:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Onwards!"

12:52 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

12:52 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

12:52 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

12:52 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

12:52 The starship has left a unique area of space.

13:17 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "720 light-years from home."

13:17 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Because of course the flow plays nicer on the way back, ha."

13:22 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

13:31 Looking ahead, the track seems long and straight. The train picks up speed.

13:42 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

13:52 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

13:53 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

13:53 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

14:08 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

14:08 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm awake."

14:23 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

14:33 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

14:38 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

14:38 You kiss Lily Kaise.

14:44 Lily Kaise glides out.

14:46 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

14:55 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

14:55 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

15:25 The webs catch the light briefly, flashing jewel-studded silver.

15:33 The webbing appears to be growing slick with some kind of strange liquid.

15:44 An insectile chittering echoes from the distance.

15:54 A row of perfectly ordered oval cocoons move past a window.

15:56 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

15:56 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

16:26 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

16:36 An annoying, rhythmic clanging gradually grows in volume until you pass a high-powered compressor on an adjacent conveyor belt.

16:46 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

16:56 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

16:56 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

17:26 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

17:29 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Have a good rest."

17:29 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'll be around a good chunk of the day. I'm pretty well rested."

17:32 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But please make sure to remove thorns before surving. So that'd be fried haw."

17:36 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

17:47 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

17:57 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

20:29 Simon Collins puts a manual zero-point energy receptacle charger in a sturdy navy blue canvas backpack.

20:29 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

20:29 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

20:29 The computer announces, "Warning: Entering riftstorm."

20:29 Hawthorn Dunn ambles west.

20:29 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

20:30 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "BACK INTO THE FRAY."

20:36 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

20:36 The horses cease their panic, and breathe hard as they resume a more normal pace.

20:36 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

20:36 The computer announces, "Leaving riftstorm."

20:37 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

20:41 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

20:45 Keegan Wantz says, "This time we'll only go careening down hills, I think."

20:46 Lily Kaise laughs.

20:46 You chuckle.

20:46 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm ok with that."

20:46 The horses cease their panic, and breathe hard as they resume a more normal pace.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

21:29 [Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Observation Deck]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft cinnamon brown leather couch, an overstuffed aquamarine sofa, a small purple trash bin, a large crystal ball, a coffee table of highly polished lunar basalt, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.
Alko Delovega is sleeping on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.
Ryan Thomas is standing here. Gonzales Bourne is dozing on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa. Clarina Taylor is dozing on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch. Blake Madison, Tony Cross, Matteo Hapta, and Simon Collins are sitting on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa. Lily Kaise is sitting on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

21:30 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

21:32 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

21:32 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

21:32 Dark clouds roll in, and the wind picks up as the surrounding waves grow choppy.
The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.
