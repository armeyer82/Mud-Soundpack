01:30 There are three headlines.

01:30 Lily Kaise says, "So until we get back, I have two ships of felo. Now the challenge will be to find someone who wouldn't mind, after about 3 weeks, transporting our ships to the landing pad and feeding from the Repair shop."

01:34 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

05:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah I said the same thing. Like why can't we just form a Pilot Owned Corporation or have a trust set up. After all there are employee-owned companies. We could also sell shares to the interested parties as well."

05:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We should find out from the government is they would allow that. That might be the only way that we regain control."

05:01 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

05:01 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

05:01 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:01 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

05:01 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:01 Lily Kaise says, "So."

05:01 Lily Kaise says, "The salvage and bAS go down in about 20 hours give or take."

05:01 You say, "Ok."

05:02 Lily Kaise says, "I assembled the Salvage so it's ready to deploy."

05:02 Lily Kaise says, "I assembled the BAS all the way but I didn't combine the core."

05:02 You say, "Ah ok."

05:02 Lily Kaise says, "So it wouldn't be as tedious."

05:02 You nod.

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "So around... let's see... 2200 the current stations will go out of service."

05:03 You say, "Ok. I should be able to take care of that."

05:03 Lily Kaise says, "I probably won't be available to redeploy them and oh that would be wonderful if you can go deploy the new ones."

05:04 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:04 You nod to Lily Kaise. "I should be able to take care of it."

05:04 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:04 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Thanks Love!"

05:05 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:05 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't know. I wasn't available to run a cleansing."

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I don't think so."

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Shall we clean it?"

05:06 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "So guess you can go check. Maybe ather did. I didn't see a report though."

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I doubt he did."

05:06 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I should be able to do it later today."

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I can't right at this moment. It's getting too late for me and I need to head to bed soon."

05:06 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Same here or I would."

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Same here."

05:06 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay. Well, I'll be around later."

05:07 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok then let's see about around 2300."

05:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay."

05:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok."

05:07 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:07 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "That will be great as if we can find another willing party, then we're good to go."

05:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Eve is always up for it."

05:08 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah great then if she's around at that time."

05:08 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:08 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Or more like available. She may be around but involved in other things."

05:09 Lily Kaise keys her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:09 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise chuckles.

05:09 You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:10 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok Constantine I won't discuss in detail here but perhaps you may want to have personal aspects ready by as early as in a week or two. I won't comment additionally here."

05:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "What do you mean?"

05:10 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Am I up for execution?"

05:11 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I really don't want to discuss over this channel but it pertains to what we were discussing the other day."

05:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."

05:11 Lily Kaise says, "Good I think he gets it now heh."

05:11 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:11 You chuckle. "Yeah."

05:11 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Ah, good morning, Constantine, Elijah. I was surprised by how low the bidding range seems to be, as well."

05:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Casen."

05:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Morning, casen."

05:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Casen."

05:12 Lily Kaise says, "I just don't know how much of this is publicized at all and I don't want to make inferences which may get things mis-communicated to the wrong parties."

05:12 You nod to Lily Kaise.

05:13 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with narrow dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

05:13 You say to Lily, "Ready to go lie down?"

05:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In my mind, if we could outbid everyone on exploration, which seems like it shouldn't even be that hard, maybe we could make a ton of money off of it and use that to buy other pieces."

05:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No one is going to really want the exploration activities, at least not at any high price."

05:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oops."

05:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No one will really want the exploration activities, at least not at a high price."

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "And Shule! Also, it does seem as though it could be done. Admittedly, I've spent nearly every credit I've earned, but in a general sort of sense."

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If such a thing were even possible, we'd likely need the AEU orgs to buy in heavily."

05:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "As there are probably only 2-3 pilots with tens of billions of credits currently."

05:17 Lily Kaise nods and smiles at you.

05:17 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

05:17 Lily Kaise glides south.

You can go out.
Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

05:17 You can't go that way.

05:17 You remove all of your clothing, placing it carefully in a small suitcase.

05:17 You lie down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

05:18 Lily Kaise says to you, "Well I probably could buy out the entire operation haha but I wouldn't want it that way if they permitted me to do so. I believe it should be a joint venture."

05:18 You chuckle at Lily Kaise. "Yeah, it really should be a joint venture I think."

05:18 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:18 You laugh.

05:18 Lily Kaise removes all of her clothing, placing it carefully in a small suitcase.

05:19 Lily Kaise says, "I just don't plan to say that publicly."

05:19 Say to whom?

05:19 You nod to Lily Kaise.

05:19 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:19 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

05:20 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

05:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I sent Ather a letter to ask the liaison office about it."

05:24 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

05:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If we could establish a pilot's trust, maybe with the elected liaison officers sitting on the board of trustees."

05:24 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

05:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would ensure that one pilot doesn't control the entire corps."

05:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they would even allow this, that is, which I doubt."

05:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "It does seem contrary to their established ways."

05:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But maybe it will appeal to both their desire to be rid of us and their desire to profit from the parting."

05:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who knows, maybe we'll get lucky."

05:31 You gently caress Lily Kaise's back and waist.

05:40 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

05:46 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

05:49 You say to Lily, "Well my love, I should say good night. I love you. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:50 Lily says to you, "Nite Love. I love you too. Rest well and sweet dreams."

05:50 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:50 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:50 You say to Lily, "Night."

05:50 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:50 You whisper to Lily Kaise.

05:54 Lily Kaise whispers, "Nite Love."

05:56 I don't see that here.

05:56 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

05:57 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins spins webbing, gathering it into a ball with his back feet, then eats it.

05:57 Lily says to a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, "Do that elsewhere please!"

05:57 Lily Kaise strokes a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins's bristly hair.

05:57 You exclaim, "No kidding!"

05:57 You say to Lily, "Night."

05:58 Lily says to you, "Nite Hun."

05:59 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters out.

06:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

06:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Aethier. I have a question for you, if you don't mind."

06:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Kason, you may be able to answer this as well. I have my alliance 10 channel tuned in and I keep getting periodic notifications about our progress What are the best ways to achieve those goals those notifications keep talking about?"

06:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Certainly. Conquest periods last four days, I believe, and are the periods that the AEU liason is referring to. There are certain goals set for our performance, though I believe the only person who can identify the exact nature of the goals is the corps' Industrial Whip, from what others have told me, and we do not have one at the moment."

06:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Alright. Well they keep saying something along the lines of, "We're making progress towards our goals. But I am not seeing anything.""

06:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Each period has two goals, one lower than the other. In the most recent period we reached our first goal. You can contribute to the overall value by participating in industrial activities, like salvaging and the like, or in combat, or in exploration, the like."

06:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. I can do that."

06:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Just so. I believe that what the most advantageous way to contribute is might change due to various factors, but as we don't have any way of identifying that right now you might as well just try to be as productive as possible, more or less."

07:26 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

07:50 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the north.

07:54 Shine the big white glowing felo rears up and plants both pairs of forelegs on Lily Kaise's leg, then rubs its head against her, purring softly.

08:06 Shine the big white glowing felo seems to be hungry.

08:06 Shine the big white glowing felo approaches a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, glances around, then begins shoveling low-grade dry Felo Chow into its mouth.

08:18 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

08:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Should you desire to make headway on industry points, getting a cargo hauler and using it to salvage debris is one of the more efficient routes. There's a temporary station you can transfer the salvage one sector east of the Steel Phoenix that will yield higher profits than selling at one of our planets, too."

08:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Ahh. Really? Where do I have to jump to for that transfer?"

08:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "You can jump directly to the Steel Phoenix - it has its own beacon that your nav system will recognize. From there you'll need to move to the eastern border of the sector and manually move over to the adjacent one. Then you'll see a station you can dock with. However, payment isn't as immediate as selling at a planet, but I find the increased return worth the wait."

08:27 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

08:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Thank you. I will keep that in mind."

08:52 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Desert Snake". The organization has earned 127,054.69 credits.

08:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

09:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:09 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

09:28 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been received at AEU Salvage Processing Nuclear Temporary Station from the one-person cargo hauler "Desert Snake". The organization has earned 63,219.23 credits.

09:28 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

09:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Elijah Tchaikovski transmits, "Good night, all."

09:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Casen Thale transmits, "Until later, Elijah."

10:32 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

11:08 You kiss Lily Kaise.

11:10 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

11:23  You are wearing a long-sleeved black tee with a large silver starburst appliqued on the front, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers.

Want to know if anyone's relaxing in a public venue? Check WHERE!

11:23 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

11:23 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

19:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

19:53 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:53 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:53 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

19:53 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

19:54 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

19:54 The ship is already moving.
The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 265" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

19:54 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

19:54 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:54 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:54 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

19:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:54 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:54 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

19:54 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:54 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:54 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

19:54 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:54 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: New Earth.

19:54 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

19:54 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

19:54 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

19:54 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

19:54 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

19:55 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

19:55 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:55 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

19:55 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

19:55 You pull a large lever towards you.

19:55 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

19:55 You scramble to your feet.

19:55 The postal machine informs you that you have mail waiting.  After some movements coming from the back room, the conveyor belt coming from the wall swiftly brings forth a thick potomac blue letter. You quickly grab it off the belt.

19:55 --
Hello friends,

If you are receiving this letter, you have been selected by Melinda, Pierre, and Damien to come on the first contact mission that the EAOS has spoke of in the headlines. This date is not set in stone, but the tentative departure date should be around April 22nd. While we want everyone to relax and have a nice trip on the way out, this is not a pleasure trip. It's not a trip in which we wish to have half the crew or hiding out in quarters or sleeping on sofas till we get back home. While we hope things go smoothly, we don't know what to expect so need to be ready for the unexpected. Also note that we will have a ship available if anyone should need a pod ride home.

I would like confirmation letters by April 19th. If we don't get a confirmation, other arrangements may be made and your seat given to someone else	. One, two,  or all three mission managers will be waiting for people to have a discussion at 21:00 on April 19 and again just after midnight on April 20. We will meet you at the Torus on dock Alpha. We hope to see you there but understand if you cannot make the meeting and/or the trip.

We hope to have more exact departure information at this gathering. We also hope to be able to answer questions that you might have. Finally, we hope to have battlesuit assignments sorted. Therefore, if I have not spoken to you about battlesuits, please list a couple of suits that you can work well with in your co
19:55 nfirmation letter. Also, if you could care less about having to use a battlesuit, let us know.

Melinda

22:40 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:40 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

22:40 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

22:40 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

22:40 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

22:40 The computer reports that your current coordinates are: (8, 11, 19)

22:40 The ship is already moving.

22:40 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

22:41 The ship is already in that sector.
