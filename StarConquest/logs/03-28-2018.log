00:13 The hoverfreeway goes dark. Only reflectors on the surface below act as guides to your driver.

00:24 Several snowglobes stacked vertically hover past at high speed.

00:34 A hooded, indistinct figure rowing a floating bathtub raises one arm and waves at you as the truck passes.

00:44 The hovertruck turns rapidly and careens off the highway, gliding through the air before evaporating into dark swirling mist.

00:44 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

01:14 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:14 The monkey jumps from branch to branch, and the ship lurches each time.

01:24 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

01:34 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

01:39 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

01:45 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

01:45 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

02:15 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

02:16 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

02:26 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

02:27 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "12 percent on the NDB."

02:27 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nearly there."

02:28 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "You know...if we find something out here. it's gonna be hard to get back, isn't it?"

02:28 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What do yuo mean?"

02:29 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Like what if we find something out here, and we want to find it again."

02:37 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

02:47 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

02:47 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

02:47 The swirling mist turns to a cloud of dust. A sudden breeze clears it, revealing that the ship is charging down a dirt road on rows of large tires. A featureless desert plain is all around.

02:50 Dust billows all around as the ship picks up speed.

03:03 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "11%!"

03:03 Lily Kaise stands up from a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

03:06 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

03:06 Lily Kaise glides out.

03:09 Lily Kaise glides in from the east.

03:10 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:17 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

03:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

03:30 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Down to ten percent! Woo!"

03:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:30 Lily Kaise carefully removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from her shoulder.

03:30 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

03:30 Lily Kaise tugs a pair of soft electric blue boots off of her feet.

03:31 Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies for a moment.

03:31 Lily Kaise puts a pair of soft electric blue boots in a small suitcase.
Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I just said that!"
Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We've also been rifting for uh...what is this uh...eight hours?"

03:31 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Almost twelve."

03:31 Lily Kaise lies down on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it.

03:31 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh do we count the zero for the cycle thing?"

03:32 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "2.I is uh, about two and eighteen of twenty five cycles."

03:32 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So just under twelve hours."

03:33 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "So we've gone about 120 light-years in 12 hours, which is... right on average, actually."

03:33 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Assuming a ten light-year per hour average, which may be inaccurate."

03:38 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

03:49 Another vehicle approaches, apparently playing chicken with your larger ship, but it swerves aside at the last moment.

03:49 The wind picks up, blowing obscuring dust over the viewscreen. All turns to mist.

03:49 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

04:19 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

04:28 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

04:38 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

04:41 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Flow's about to smack us in the face, alas, alack."

04:47 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

04:50 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

04:50 The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.

04:55 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

04:57 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Drive faster."

05:04 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

05:04 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I've never seen this riftscape before."

05:04 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "At least, it's more rare if I have."

05:12 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

05:14 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Huh."

05:21 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

05:30 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

05:39 The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

05:49 You notice the starship seems to be drifting more slowly through the water.

05:52 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

05:52 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

05:54 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Farewell people."

05:59 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Um....."

05:59 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thanks Gonzales!"

05:59 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hm?"

05:59 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, socks."

05:59 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Of course!"
Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I just got a trenchcoat."

06:00 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

06:00 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thank you, Gonzales."

06:02 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We are gloriously ungrateful."

06:02 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I kind of like the trenchcoat. Little worn, but it's comfortable."

06:10 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

06:11 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh my."

06:11 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "What's up?"

06:11 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

06:11 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

06:12 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Flow flow."

06:12 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh dear. I see what you mean."

06:12 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, flow's getting southwestish, so it'll get even worse."

06:12 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

06:17 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No pictures. Got it."

06:18 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "But honey. I think on the Gray expedition, they made me wear a little sailor outfit for days."

06:21 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

06:22 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I miss you, gonzales!"

06:23 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Also, that was a good sandwich. Please remember where you got it."

06:32 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "There we are."

06:33 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well that's the speed you get if you travel with horses rather than starships."

06:33 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Horsepower!"

06:33 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

06:33 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

06:43 A small stand of trees passes by on the right of the carriage.

06:53 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

06:53 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

07:18 You inhale deeply and a warm, heavy liquid floods your lungs.

07:29 You scratch at your arm, and a perfectly rectangular sheet of skin peels off.

07:39 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

07:49 Sweat pours down your face in rivulets as the stage lights shine on you.

07:52 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/Announcements.

07:54 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

07:54 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

08:24 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:34 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:44 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:55 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:56 A large leaf brushes over the viewports, blocking the view outside. When it recedes, all you see outside is swirling mist.

08:56 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

08:56 The outcropping veers suddenly.

08:56 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

08:56 The outcropping veers suddenly.

08:56 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

08:57 A gust of wind catches the island, sending it off in a new direction.

08:57 The grassy outcropping hits a gentle headwind, slowing its pace.

08:58 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

09:26 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

09:37 A flock of large, white birds with long, multicolored tail feathers circle around the outcrop, then disappear off into a cloud, their calls echoing in the distance.

09:47 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

09:57 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

09:59 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

09:59 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

10:02 The monkey tosses the ship to another monkey.

10:02 The monkey drops down to a lower branch.

10:03 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

10:27 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If noone else is awake I'll be watching it."

10:27 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Thank you!"

10:28 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If we have enough people awake, I'd like to shovel more of the hydrogen in at the next find, think it's getting close to when we'll want to flatten out then turn around."

10:28 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Really want to start shoveling already? From what I read here this should last us a few more days easily, but its tct so I'm probably getting it horribly wrong."

10:29 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yeah, I want to turn around with a full battery and 50% wear, more or less."

10:29 The monkey tosses the ship from hand to hand. "Ook ook EEK," it offers as explanation.

10:29 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We didn't get the best speed out, but we might hit a calm on the way back or some shit like that."

10:39 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

10:50 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

11:00 The jungle floor rushes by underneath the ship as the monkey jumps from one tree to another.

11:00 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

11:00 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

11:27 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

11:27 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

11:27 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

11:28 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:29 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:38 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Ugh, my head."

11:39 On the shore are several gnarled trees with the faces of people, bleeding from scored bark and snapped branches.

11:49 On the shore, a number of bodies are stretched out on burning sand as fire falls from the sky.

11:51 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

11:51 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:53 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

11:54 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone awake who can help me do spectrography and immaging things once we arrive at this place?"

11:55 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure."

11:55 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Awesome."

11:55 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I can't but I'm up!"

11:55 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It'll be a while before we get there, the rift is doing all it can to make this a pain, so we'll have to sit tite."

11:56 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It's called, Death and realization? Or the computer has labeled it this? How...emo."

11:56 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Don't ask me."

11:56 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Probably another alien graveyard."

11:56 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They wanted to be really bleak with it."

12:03 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

12:03 Multicolored light suddenly bursts through the shifting mist, nearly blinding you as they slice across your view, and they form winding pathways through billowing clouds.

12:18 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

12:33 Flashes of light pulsate from the rainbow pathways.

12:40 The rainbow pathway curves a wide path around a cloud, banking slightly.

12:40 The rainbow pathways generate slow, rhythmic pulses of light.

12:41 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

13:00 The rainbow pathways generate quick, erratic pulses of light.

13:02 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

13:03 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally just shifting mists.

13:03 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

13:13 The monkey jumps high, climbing to a higher branch.

13:26 The monkey tosses the ship to another monkey.

13:27 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

13:27 Strange hulks of alien origin litter this region of space, from unrecognizable slag that was never any human design and oddly shaped metal plating to glittering metal devices whose purposes are unknown.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

13:28 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Anyone awake?"

13:28 Tony Cross's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yes."

13:28 The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the launch tube, then deployed.

13:28 Matteo Hapta's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yup."

13:40 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

13:40 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

13:40 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

13:40 The starship has left a unique area of space.

14:10 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

14:20 The computer reports that the magistrate-class mothership "Zmnyi Mmyaz" has a lock on this starship.

14:21 Tony Cross's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Wow."

14:21 Matteo Hapta's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Is someone in the control room? I think that's a patrol ship."

14:21 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Na, the rift's fucking with ya."

14:21 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nah."

14:21 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The myas went poof in the resistance."

14:21 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It still exists. Just under contro."

14:22 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Control."

14:31 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

14:41 A dark shape flits past the viewport.

14:41 A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off.  Speaking over it, the computer announces, "Fatal hit received.  Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection." Your vision goes black for a moment as everything fades into formless mist.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "We fucked?"

15:29  You are wearing a black shipsuit with silver trim around the collar and cuffs. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs. You are also wearing a keychain, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a backpack, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, a leather briefcase, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a flight control scanner, and a black engineering tool case. Your head, face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.

You can go east and west.

15:29 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well, we'll fight. The result will determine who's fucked."

15:30 You hear a "ping" sound as the ship's computer detects an active sensor sweep. The sound seems fairly loud.

15:30 Kiska the humanoid service robot

15:30 This is a slim, sleek robot with delicate articulated hands and soft understanding eyes. It is designed to see to your every need. It is a professional.

15:30 Ryan Thomas's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Aye."

15:30 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh look."

15:30 You say, "Kiska follow."

15:30 Kiska the humanoid service robot says in a synthesized voice, "Order confirmed."

15:30 
[Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on yellow alert. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a dark violet fabric armchair, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, a black plastic box labeled 'Photos', an Accord long-range sensor technician, a black plastic paper dispenser, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
Gonzales Bourne and Simon Collins are standing here.

15:31 An Outsider patrol returns to its original vector and decreases speed.

15:31 Gonzales Bourne activates the long-range scanner and searches for passive detections and recent ping returns.

15:31 Gonzales Bourne accidentally slams his shoulder into Shule Elemmire as he attempts to work with the long range scanner controls.
(10 seconds roundtime.)

15:31 You say, "Oh dear."

15:31 Wait 1 second.

15:31 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing an electric blue synthcotton shipsuit with a spiral galaxy printed on the chest. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Aste
15:31 ria. Her head, face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

15:31 You kiss Lily Kaise.

15:31 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Holy....holy...."

15:31 You have the computer scan the riftflow for nearby things of interest.
There appears to be nothing unique in the nearby riftflow. In realspace, there's nothing but vacuum all around.

15:31 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "It gone?"

15:31 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "7 ltc. Getting away."

15:31 Simon Collins says into the PA microphone, "We lost them?"

15:31 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Aye."

15:31 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Looks like it..."

15:32 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "It might make a turn."

15:32 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "For now."

15:32 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "7.13."

15:32 Lily Kaise says, "Let's hope so."

15:32 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Okay that's good...."

15:32 You nod.

15:32 Clarina Taylor says, "Well. I'm awake now."

15:32 You say, "Me too."

15:32 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

15:33 You say, "But this ship is not designed to fight."

15:33 Lily Kaise leans on you.

15:33 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm not gonna lie, I almost shit my pants."

15:33 Clarina Taylor says, "It really isn't."

15:33 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

15:33 Simon Collins says, "Don't think we'll have to."

15:33 You sit down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

15:33 Lily Kaise nods.

15:33 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "7.38."

15:33 Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "So why did it stop pinging?"

15:33 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Looks like we lost them..."

15:33 Simon Collins says into the PA microphone, "Lost our signature."

15:33 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Not sure at all. They seem to have just stopped."

15:34 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Looks like they lost us."

15:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yep if they stopped, they probably didn't detect our signature once we reduced trim and went yellow and such."

15:34 You nod.

15:34 You nod to Lily Kaise.

15:34 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Nah if they've stopped it means they're there just not following..."

15:34 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Logic dictates that they'd ping even more when they lose the signature. Let's hope they are not preparing for PWD or something."

15:34 Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "Right."

15:34 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Precisely."

15:34 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Riiight."

15:34 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Good job guys."

15:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

15:35 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "I didn't do anthing but sit here and panic after waking up. But woo, good job everyone else."

15:35 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I just woke up. Hell of a way to wake up."

15:35 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Means this is going to ba a pretty dicey area though. Can't let our guard down for sure! Guess our all night drinking parties are over for the time being!"

15:35 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "8.0."

15:35 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "I think you were scared, but you didn't panic."

15:35 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Let's really hope we don't run into anymore of those..."

15:36 Ryan Thomas navigates his black touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:36 Lily Kaise says, "Keep anything valuable close by but I'm sure you all know the drill on that."

15:37 Clarina Taylor taps a knitting bag.

15:37 Lily Kaise grins at Clarina Taylor.
Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We're kind of going at the opposite direction of our original heading."

15:37 You hug Kiska the humanoid service robot.

15:37 You hug Lily Kaise.

15:37 Lily Kaise hugs you.

15:37 You say, "My two most important things."

15:37 You say, "Not in that order."

15:37 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "8.55."

15:37 Simon Collins says into the PA microphone, "We can turn back once they disappear from sensors completely."

15:37 Lily Kaise laughs.

15:37 Lily Kaise removes a Tardick lizard named Asteria from a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'.

15:37 Clarina Taylor pats Ryan Thomas on the back.

15:37 Lily Kaise settles a Tardick lizard named Asteria on her shoulder, its tail curled loosely around her.

15:38 Clarina Taylor says, "Mine keeps wandering around."

15:38 Lily Kaise kisses you.

15:38 Lily Kaise strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm scaly skin.

15:38 You kiss Lily Kaise.

15:38 You grin.

15:38 Lily Kaise grins.

15:38 You see a figure walk past the open doorway out of the corner of your eye.

15:38 Clarina Taylor says, "Worse than a felo."

15:38 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Oh my wine decanter!"

15:38 You chuckle at Clarina Taylor.

15:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

15:38 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The main heading will be south for now. We'll ever so slowly start turning up and then southwest as we move."

15:38 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Sounds like a plan."

15:38 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

15:38 Lily Kaise says, "And yes the hot tub."

15:38 Simon Collins navigates his light golden brown touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

15:38 Clarina Taylor switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

15:38 You say, "Definitely."

15:38 Simon Collins switches a light golden brown touch einrophone off.

15:38 You exclaim, "That's very important too!"

15:39 Lily Kaise grins.

15:39 You grin at Lily Kaise.

15:39 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "9.15."

15:39 Lily says to you, "I put everything on the hoverpallet including the fish tanks so I'll probably keep them there as I can just mannually feed while we're in this area."

15:40 Clarina Taylor switches a message board reader off.

15:40 I don't understand that.

15:40 Clarina Taylor pulls out a pair of knitting needles and some yarn, and begins knitting furiously.

15:40 You nod to Lily Kaise. "Makes sense."

15:41 Clarina Taylor says, "This may be super old fashioned, but man it relaxes me."

15:41 Lily Kaise girns cromulently at Clarina Taylor.

15:41 Lily Kaise blinks.

15:41 Lily Kaise says, "Ooop."

15:41 Lily Kaise grins at Clarina Taylor.

15:41 You grin at Clarina Taylor.

15:41 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "10.26."

15:42 You say to Clarina, "Nothing wrong with doing that."

15:42 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "They are heading downish."

15:42 Lily Kaise removes a soft lavender knitted blanket from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

15:42 Lily Kaise hugs a soft lavender knitted blanket.

15:42 You grin at Lily Kaise.

15:42 Clarina Taylor smiles.

15:42 Lily Kaise shows a soft lavender knitted blanket to you.

15:42 "That's cool!" You smile at Lily Kaise.

15:42 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Could turn us upward to get away faster, but won't risk it right now."

15:42 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "10.62."

15:42 Lily says to you, "Isn't that lovely? Clari gave that to me and she knitted it herself."

15:42 Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "I wonder what they're patroling with."

15:42 You say, "Wow1."

15:43 You exclaim, "That's amazing!"

15:43 Lily Kaise nods and smiles.

15:43 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "I don't really want to go back and find out."

15:43 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Um no."

15:43 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

15:43 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Well when we encountered them it wasn't just one ship and there were rapids."

15:43 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Could always ping back and ask when we have a cruiser."

15:43 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "NOooo!"

15:43 Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "Whatever it is, our six turrets will win the day."

15:43 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Uh nu uh."

15:43 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "NOt again!"

15:44 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Nope, I won't even play with them in a cruiser."

15:44 Hawthorn Dunn says into the PA microphone, "Better to fight if you have to then give up."

15:44 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

15:44 Gonzales Bourne says, "Mantis always rocks."

15:44 Gonzales Bourne sprints north.

15:44 Clarina Taylor blinks.

15:44 You chuckle.

15:45 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "A cruiser would just draw out a bigger pack of them as there's likely a few attached to this patrol as they would draw in more if they pulled us out of the rift like it did to us before when we lost Matt's Platform."

15:45 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "I think we're all joking at this point."

15:45 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Releasing tention."

15:45 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We are."

15:45 Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "Take capsule to fight patrol."

15:47 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Very easy beacon might be somewhat doable."

15:48 You speak into the PA microphone, saying, "Just don't try to use manual controls while flying."

16:44 The water suddenly roils as it drains rapidly from the bowl. Mist rises from the drain, obscuring your vision.

16:44 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

16:52 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Far enough, but I want them to completely disappear."

16:58 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

16:58 Keegan Wantz says, "You have no idea how glad I am that I went over evading patrols."

16:58 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

16:58 Lily says to Keegan, "Yeah right?"

16:58 Lily Kaise laughs.

16:58 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

16:58 Gonzales Bourne says to Keegan, "It's best to keep the main heading to south. When we lose them, we could ever so slowly get back to our original heading. Going upward is fine, but might want to wait a little before turning southwest. So we don't get back into their range."

16:59 Lily Kaise pats Gonzales Bourne on the back.

16:59 Keegan Wantz says, "I'm thinking that uhh."

16:59 Keegan Wantz says, "We're gonna go southeast."

16:59 Keegan Wantz coughs.

16:59 Gonzales Bourne says, "After we completely lose them, that is. Don't want to make any changes until they are completely gone."

17:07 Lily Kaise asks, "Where is which?"

17:07 Keegan Wantz says, "I am going to be somewhat amused if there's no message in here about patrols."

17:08 Keegan Wantz says, "None."

17:08 Lily Kaise nods.

17:08 Keegan Wantz strides north.

17:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:11 Keegan Wantz says, "Okay."

17:11 Keegan Wantz says, "When they're gone gone."

17:12 Keegan Wantz says, "Stay on this heading, and get us away from this spot as quick as possible."

17:12 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

17:12 Keegan Wantz says, "Flow's pretty okay for that, actually."

17:13 Keegan Wantz strides north.

17:13 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

17:13 Keegan Wantz says, "We can head southeast until arounddddddddddd half charge or so, then I'll want to turn back towards home."

17:13 Tony Cross says, "Ok."

17:13 Keegan Wantz says, "More importantly, we need the patrol to be gone."

17:13 Keegan Wantz coughs.

17:14 Keegan Wantz strides north.

17:14 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

17:14 Keegan Wantz says to Gonzales, "Want to keep an eye on that again, or need someone else to?"

17:14 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

17:14 Gonzales Bourne says, "Sure."

17:14 Gonzales Bourne sprints north.

17:15 Keegan Wantz says, "Alright, let's see.."

17:15 Keegan Wantz strides north.

17:18 Keegan Wantz says, "Distance increasing."

17:18 Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

17:18 Hawthorn Dunn says, "It was pinging..."

17:18 Keegan Wantz says, "Yep."

17:18 Tony Cross walks in from the north.

17:19 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Is it pinging again?"

17:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

17:20 Keegan Wantz says, "Nope."

17:20 Keegan Wantz says, "It's pretty far away at this point."

17:20 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Okay so...how close to outsider space are we?"

17:20 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh."

17:21 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "So can we like...out run it?"

17:22 Keegan Wantz says, "No."

17:22 Keegan Wantz says, "We're evading it."

17:22 Keegan Wantz says, "They proceeded to where they last saw us, after we swapped to yellow alert and all that fun stuff."

17:22 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right... isn't thatthe same thing? or is it not chasing us."

17:22 Keegan Wantz says, "It's not chasing us."

17:22 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh."

17:22 Hawthorn Dunn says, "...oh."

17:22 Keegan Wantz says, "They can outrun rift drives superrrr easy."

17:22 Hawthorn Dunn sighs. "Well, that's a relief."

17:23 Keegan Wantz says, "They have tech that's called uhh, phased warp drives, pretty sure."

17:23 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "So what's the plan do we keep going the same direction and keep trying to dodge them? Or are we changing course?"

17:23 Keegan Wantz says, "Same direction."

17:23 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh. Huh. Well that sucks."

17:23 Keegan Wantz says, "The important thing is becoming a much smaller energy signature."

17:23 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ah."

17:23 Keegan Wantz says, "Nah, I wanted to turn south soon anyway."

17:24 Keegan Wantz says, "We're getting near the 'gotta turn around for battery reasons' point."

17:24 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I gotcha."

17:24 Keegan Wantz says, "Well."

17:24 Keegan Wantz says, "Not -gotta-."

17:24 Keegan Wantz says, "But I want to have plenty of buffer."

17:24 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Though I mean... I'm freaked out as hell. I want this to go well for you. And it'd be shitty to be blown up or worse."

17:24 Keegan Wantz says, "Eh, we're fine."

17:25 Keegan Wantz says, "This is why I went over evading patrols with everyone who didn't know already, who was around."

17:25 A pleasing, throbbing warmth suffuses your body.

17:25 Keegan Wantz says, "And posted it."

17:25 Keegan Wantz pats a message board reader lightly.

17:25 Hawthorn Dunn nods.

17:25 Keegan Wantz says, "Uhh."

17:25 Keegan Wantz glances around at his surroundings.

17:25 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "2.51."

17:25 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Switch to yellow, turn off all unnecessary systems... try and dodge and get out of dodge."

17:26 Keegan Wantz says, "Yep."

17:26 Keegan Wantz says, "Getting off our original heading helps, the flow was conveniently handy, this time."

17:26 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I just wonder if they're protecting something or just jumping about for prey."

17:27 Keegan Wantz says, "The latter, usually."

17:27 Keegan Wantz says, "They don't want us to get too far from home."

17:27 Keegan Wantz says, "Keeps us from contacting other aliens and whatnot."

17:27 Keegan Wantz shrugs.

17:28 Hawthorn Dunn says, "So...are we operating under the no risk no reward policy at this point or..."

17:28 Keegan Wantz says, "Like I said, we're offsetting our course until about 50% charge or so, then heading home."

17:28 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

17:29 Keegan Wantz says, "Maybe a little bit lower than 50% charge, we'll see."

17:29 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Yeah. I mean I don't really wanna book it home. But god that had me stressed out as hell. Like what a thing to wake up to. I'm glad Gonzales is good at what he does."

17:29 Keegan Wantz says, "Basically, we've been heading out for uhh."

17:29 Hawthorn Dunn nods.

17:29 Keegan Wantz says, "Almost 6 days at this point, about 6 days when we hit 50% charge."

17:30 Keegan Wantz says, "Ship's battery is about 3.7~ days, give a bit."

17:30 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right."

17:30 Keegan Wantz says, "Overall, we've got justtttttt about 15 days of charge."

17:30 Keegan Wantz says, "So I want to have a full extra day of buffer, for the way home."

17:30 A Tardick lizard named Asteria, perched on Lily Kaise's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

17:30 Hawthorn Dunn says, "That'd be good."

17:30 Keegan Wantz says, "Because we could hit a calm or something like that."

17:31 Keegan Wantz says, "Or another patrol, yellow alert drains battery like woah."

17:31 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Right."

17:31 Hawthorn Dunn says, "If you do manage to help us get an exploration ship maybe you should ask them if we have the knowledge to give us enhanced cloaking for stealth maneuvers and stuff like this."

17:32 Keegan Wantz says, "Gotta use the head, back shortly."

17:32 Keegan Wantz says, "Ha, I doubt this will be enough for that."

17:32 Keegan Wantz says, "It's the... third? Fringe expedition pretty much ever."

17:32 Keegan Wantz says, "We'll see, though."

17:32 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "To the head!"

17:32 Keegan Wantz scrambles to his feet.

17:32 Keegan Wantz strides north.

17:36 A pleasing, throbbing warmth suffuses your body.

17:46 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

17:46 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

17:46 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

18:03 Gonzales Bourne's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Patrol's 3.31."

18:04 Gonzales Bourne sprints in from the north.

18:04 Gonzales Bourne says to Keegan Wantz, "Need you to take over. I think I'll get some rest."

18:05 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "What the NDB is getting louder?"

18:05 Hawthorn Dunn blinks at Blake Madison.

18:05 Gonzales Bourne says, "Because we're heading back down."

18:05 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Ooh."

18:05 Keegan Wantz nods to Gonzales Bourne.

18:05 Gonzales Bourne nods.

18:05 Keegan Wantz strides north.

18:05 Gonzales Bourne exclaims, "Thanks!"

18:08 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

18:10 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Well, now that I'm stressed to the max. Gonna get a bit of genuine rest. Yell if I'm needed."

18:10 Hawthorn Dunn scrambles to his feet.

18:10 Hawthorn Dunn ambles west.

18:12 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

18:13 Keegan Wantz says, "Waiting for it to drop off sensors."

18:13 Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

18:32 Blake says to Keegan, "What makes you think it's not."

18:33 Keegan Wantz says, "I can't tell from the scanner."

18:33 Lily Kaise says, "It was."

18:33 Blake says to Keegan, "What makes you think it's not-keegan could we tell last time?"

18:33 Keegan says to Blake, "No."

18:33 Blake Madison nods.

18:33 Keegan says to Blake, "The ship announces 'Outside patrol detected' and turning and whatnot."

18:33 Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

18:33 Keegan Wantz says, "It's just a HUGE energy signature."

18:33 Keegan Wantz says, "We're still seeing them almost 4 LTC away."

18:33 Blake Madison nods.

18:34 Blake Madison says, "I'd still keep going on what we're doing then."

18:34 Keegan Wantz nods.

18:34 Keegan Wantz strides north.

18:34 Blake Madison says into the PA microphone, "We're not equipped to fight are we?"

18:34 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I only saw one indication and i'm glad, like you that I knew what it was although I was hoping it might be a Genship... or at least a friendly Genship but nope it was an Outsider Patrol."

18:34 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No exploration vessel is well equipped to fight."

19:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

19:26 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

19:38 It's not always about where you're going.

19:38 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

19:47 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If we hit the nebula are we gonna have to hide there or what's the likely hood of just jumpingin and kicking the crap out of us."

19:49 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Very unlikely, nebulas fuck up sensors badly."

19:49 Remember what I said.

19:49 The mist swirls and takes on the form of a thick jungle fog. An oversized monkey reaches down, picks up the ship, and examines it. "Ook ook," remarks the monkey, before climbing rapidly up the nearest tree.

19:50 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I got no idea. So Let's hope."

19:53 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I don't think that the patrol is even moving, to be honest."

20:44 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "And I think that we'd light up pretty bright if we were fusing materials."

20:44 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Yeah which concerns me that we're going in there but perhaps we'll be ok."

20:45 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nebulas hide things, Lily."

20:45 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

20:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria curls its tail loosely around Lily Kaise's neck.

20:52 The monkey loses its grip on the ship! You plunge toward the forest floor. The scene spins dizzyingly, then dissolves into swirling mist.

20:52 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

20:52 The platform suddenly turns as it narrowly misses being smashed by a falling rock.

20:52 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

20:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Please, rift."

20:53 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Afraid that if I turn us to green they'll hone right in on us."

21:04 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

21:04 A large mass of dust is before the starship, tendrils unfurling in all directions like an explosion frozen in time. A diffuse glow emanates from the depths of the dust cloud, indicating the birth of new stars.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

22:15 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm surprised that they're still visible at all, to be honest."

22:15 Ryan Thomas says into the PA microphone, "Only one way to find out."

22:15 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "If they hit 10 LTC, we're just gonna go."

22:16 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sitting at yellow is draining the battery something fierce, even with systems off."

22:16 Ryan Thomas moves north on a small burst from his reactionless jet.

22:20 Ather Jammoa awkwardly floats in.

22:20 Ather Jammoa removes spacesuit components from a tyrian purple flightbag covered in nested Apollonian gaskets and quickly dons them.

22:21 The computer announces, "Complete data from McHugh Aeronautics Soft Impact Probe on close approach received."

22:23 You hear a single beep and glance up to see green lights flick on overhead as the ship enters normal status.

22:23 The computer announces, "Initializing startup procedures for navigation systems."

22:23 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I am going to chart."

22:24 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

22:25 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Go ahead and shovel, folks."

22:25 Blake Madison awkwardly floats north.

22:25 Clarina Taylor moves north on a small burst from her reactionless jet.

22:25 The blast chamber begins warming up.

22:25 Matteo Hapta awkwardly floats north.

22:28 The computer announces, "Navigation systems online."

22:29 The computer announces, "Initializing startup procedures for artificial gravity systems."

22:30 The computer announces, "Artificial gravity systems online."

22:30 You suddenly fall to the deck as artificial gravity is abruptly restored.

22:32 The blast chamber shuts down, having enough fuel to fully recharge the starship.

22:32 Blake Madison walks in from the north.

22:33 Blake Madison sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

22:33 Ryan Thomas roams in from the north followed by Clarina Taylor.

22:33 Matteo Hapta walks in from the north.

22:33 Ryan Thomas disbands his group.

22:33 Matteo Hapta sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

22:33 Matteo Hapta takes a bite of a hot beef burger with cheese.

22:36 Simon Collins yawns suddenly, and collapses to the ground, asleep.

22:36 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gonna be charging for a good bit."

22:38 Lily Kaise glides in from the north.

22:38 Magellan the arachnoid security robot skitters in after Lily Kaise.

22:38 Lily Kaise sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

22:42 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "While we're charging!"

22:42 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Story time!"

22:42 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

22:42 Keegan Wantz sits down.

22:42 Keegan Wantz beams.

22:42 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Little bit early, but eh."

22:42 Keegan Wantz stands up.

22:42 Keegan Wantz strides north.

22:42 Clarina Taylor smiles.

22:42 Clarina Taylor says, "Fine by me."

22:42 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

22:42 Keegan Wantz sits down.

22:42 Clarina Taylor sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

22:42 Keegan Wantz says, "Excellent, excellent."

22:42 Clarina Taylor removes a soft azure blue knitted blanket from a large dark blue canvas duffel bag.

22:42 Clarina Taylor puts down a soft azure blue knitted blanket.

22:42 Keegan Wantz asks, "So, would anyone in particular like to start?"

22:42 Clarina Taylor stands up from an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

22:43 Clarina Taylor lies down on a soft azure blue knitted blanket.

22:43 Keegan Wantz takes off a reactionless spacesuit jet.

22:43 Keegan Wantz puts a reactionless spacesuit jet in a creased black flightbag.

22:43 Ryan Thomas removes the components of his spacesuit and places them neatly into a black flightbag with a silver lightning bolt on the side.

22:43 Ryan Thomas says, "Uh."

22:43 Ryan Thomas says, "I don't have any great stories."

22:43 Ryan Thomas shrugs.

22:43 Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.

22:43 Matteo Hapta says, "Me neigher."

22:43 Matteo Hapta says, "Neither."

22:44 Clarina Taylor laughs.

22:44 Keegan says to Ather Jammoa, "Why did we need to rescue Fienstein?"

22:44 Clarina Taylor sits up.

22:44 Keegan Wantz says, "I can't remember."

22:44 Ather Jammoa says, "Well."

22:44 Clarina Taylor stands up.

22:44 Clarina Taylor sits down on a soft azure blue knitted blanket.

22:45 Ather Jammoa says, "It was more along the lines of rescue fienstein/investigate-this-anomaly-thing."

22:45 Ather Jammoa says, "And quite frankly, they decided it was worth the risk cause we did need his genius."

22:47 Keegan Wantz nods.

22:47 Keegan Wantz says, "So, way back in the dayyyyyyyyyyyyy."

22:47 Keegan Wantz says, "There were no rift drives."

22:47 Keegan Wantz says, "In fact, all exploration had basically died down to local artifact hunting, like we do at Mir or in the Drift Funnel."

22:48 Keegan Wantz asks, "Does that sound boring to you folks?"

22:48 Keegan Wantz grins.

22:48 Ryan Thomas nods.

22:49 Keegan Wantz says, "Well, fortunately this lovely anomaly was relatively close to home."

22:49 Keegan Wantz says, "And last the EAOS knew, Fienstein had gone missing in or near it."

22:49 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

22:49 Keegan Wantz says, "So, they sent us to investigate."

22:49 Hawthorn Dunn sits down.

22:49 Keegan Wantz asks, "Now, what do you suppose happens when you bring a starship near some strange spacial anomaly that you have no idea about?"

22:50 Ryan Thomas says, "Uh."

22:50 Matteo Hapta asks, "You get sucked in?"

22:50 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "A multitude of things!"

22:50 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I bet sucked in like Matteo said."

22:51 Raising his voice a little bit, Keegan exclaims, "Very fucking bad things that no one wants to fucking remember!"

22:51 Keegan Wantz says, "Alas, we remember them."

22:51 Keegan Wantz says, "I believe we had three starships that were enroute to investigate."

22:51 Ather Jammoa says, "Yep."

22:51 Hawthorn Dunn absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

22:51 Keegan Wantz says, "Anddddddddddddd we flew straight into the rift."

22:51 Ather Jammoa chuckles. "One of them was a gunship."

22:52 Keegan Wantz says, "Now, you might not think that sounds too bad, given that we currently travel through the rift with our drives."

22:52 Keegan Wantz says, "But that? Well, we're just on the surface when we do that."

22:52 Keegan Wantz says, "No, we all plowed straight into the rift."

22:52 Keegan Wantz says, "And the ships.. vanished around us."

22:52 Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

22:53 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "We did find some of them later!"

22:53 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh..."

22:53 Keegan Wantz says, "Very far from home, if I recall correctly."

22:53 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

22:53 Ather Jammoa says, "Yeah fuck yeah far from home."

22:53 Keegan Wantz says, "It was not like the visions and alterations we see while using rift drives."

22:53 Keegan Wantz says, "They actually, poof, were gone."

22:53 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Huh..."

22:53 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Did you guys have anything on to like protect you?"

22:54 Keegan Wantz says, "Like I said, we're barely scratching the surface in these things."

22:54 Keegan Wantz says, "Oh of course not."

22:54 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

22:54 Hawthorn Dunn whistles.

22:54 Clarina Taylor asks, "How far from home?"

22:54 Keegan Wantz says, "Like, thousands of light-years, if I recall."

22:54 Clarina Taylor says, "Oh wow."

22:55 Keegan Wantz says, "Ather would know better, for that."

22:55 Keegan Wantz asks, "So, the best part?"

22:55 Keegan Wantz says, "We were all scrambled."

22:55 Clarina Taylor asks, "Scrambled?"

22:55 Keegan Wantz says, "We had to find eachother."

22:55 Clarina Taylor says, "Ah yeah."

22:55 Keegan Wantz says, "Yeah, the rift is.."

22:55 Keegan Wantz says, "Hmm."

22:55 Keegan Wantz says, "Bees."

22:55 Keegan Wantz says, "Bees are a good example."

22:55 Ather Jammoa says, "Many bees."

22:55 Keegan Wantz glances at Ather Jammoa.

22:56 Keegan Wantz says, "We will just leave that at bees."

22:56 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

22:56 Clarina Taylor says, "I don't care for those much up close and personal like."

22:56 Keegan Wantz asks, "Any questions so far?"

22:56 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm lost about the bees..."

22:56 Ryan Thomas says, "Likewise."

22:56 Keegan Wantz says, "We encountered."

22:56 Keegan Wantz says, "Many bees."

22:56 Keegan Wantz says, "And I do not care to elaborate."

22:56 Ather Jammoa says, "It's for the best that you don't know."

22:56 Ather Jammoa absently bobs his head up and down like a space parakeet.

22:56 Ryan Thomas says, "Right."

22:56 Ryan Thomas says, "Ok."

22:56 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Sure."

22:56 Lily Kaise smirks.

22:57 Clarina Taylor asks, "What'd you do?"

22:57 Keegan Wantz says, "I did mention that we've tried REALLY FUCKING HARD."

22:57 Keegan Wantz says, "To forget this."

22:57 Clarina Taylor smiles.

22:57 Keegan Wantz says, "Doesn't work, though."

22:57 Clarina Taylor says, "You brought it up."

22:57 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah so."

22:57 Keegan Wantz says, "Right, because it doesn't work."

22:57 Ather Jammoa shudders.

22:57 Keegan Wantz says, "Forgetting the raw rift is.. difficult at besst."

22:57 Keegan Wantz says, "Best, rather."

22:57 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I guess I don't get how Bees and rift things and well, yeah...So bad things."

22:57 Keegan Wantz says, "We actually lost at least one pilot to retirement from the mental effects caused by that, but we'll get there."

22:58 Hawthorn scratches his head.

22:58 Clarina Taylor says, "Oh man."

22:58 Hawthorn Dunn whistles.

22:58 Ather Jammoa says, "It was rather incredibly traumatic."

22:58 Keegan Wantz says, "So, after we reunited, we actually managed to find Fienstein."

22:58 Ather says to Keegan, "Well."

22:58 Ather Jammoa says, "Not really, Euclid took us to him afte rmuch convincing."

22:58 Keegan Wantz says, "More like we were drawn to h- yes."

22:58 Keegan Wantz says nothing.

22:58 Keegan Wantz says, "Euclid was... an interesting creature."

22:59 Keegan Wantz says, "It is, or was, a rift entity that uh."

22:59 Keegan Wantz says, "Did not subsume us."

22:59 Clarina Taylor says, "Well then."

22:59 Keegan Wantz says, "Not that some people did not try to get subsumed."

22:59 Ather Jammoa exclaims, "Like Asteris!"

23:00 Keegan Wantz says, "I never experienced myself, but supposedly if it started sharing bits of itself with you, your perceptions expanded in a terrifying manner."

23:00 Keegan Wantz says, "Asteris loved that shit."

23:00 Hawthorn Dunn says, "That...sounds disturbing."

23:00 Keegan Wantz says, "And never could go back to properly being a pilot afterwards."

23:00 Keegan Wantz says, "Hence, her retirement."

23:01 Keegan Wantz says, "Anyway."

23:01 Keegan Wantz says, "Euclid brought us to Fienstein, after coaxing."

23:01 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "You had to convince it to let you go?"

23:01 Keegan Wantz says, "And, long story short, we convinced him that he was needed, and he... willed the rift to transport us to the,,, Torus? more or less."

23:01 Ather Jammoa says, "Na."

23:01 Keegan Wantz coughs.

23:02 Ather Jammoa asks, "Remember that Barnoble was waiting for us in a ship outside the rift?"

23:02 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "OH!"

23:02 Keegan Wantz says, "Right."

23:02 Keegan Wantz snaps his fingers.

23:02 Keegan Wantz says, "That's right."

23:02 Keegan Wantz says, "He was... awfully surprised when we popped up."

23:02 Keegan Wantz says, "We still don't know how exactly Fienstein managed that, but it worked."

23:02 Ather Jammoa says, "His reaction was more comical when Euclid popped in after us."

23:03 Ather Jammoa says, "Fienstein was in the rift for well over 10 years. He learned the finer points of manipulating it to his will."

23:05 Keegan Wantz says, "Aye, it was uhh."

23:05 Keegan Wantz says, "Rather.. intriguingly terrifying."

23:05 Keegan Wantz says, "After that point, Euclid stuck around in realspace for awhile, appearing in peoples' bathrooms and whatnot."

23:05 Keegan Wantz says, "But we have not seen or heard from it in a long time."

23:06 Keegan says to Ather, "Have any good ones?"

23:06 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

23:06 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "If anyone else wants to tell a story, keep in mind that it does not have to be related to us in any way. Could be spooky! Could be heartwarming!"

23:07 Keegan Wantz says, "Like Ather Jammoa and I's love, which created our lovechild Roleplaying Eradication Softwarepr."

23:07 Keegan Wantz says, "Skipper, guh."

23:08 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Uh."

23:08 Slack-Jawed Reg Tourist Lily Kaise grins.

23:09 Keegan Wantz says, OOCly, "Typoed Skipper into the usual Eradication Software Mispelling, pardon that."

23:09 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I mean I don't have anything really interesting. I've not done anything really yet, other than lit crap on fire one time in my parents kitchen when they had me on cook duty."

23:10 A one-eyed man with red dreadlocks walks into the room.

23:10 Ather Jammoa frowns.

23:10 Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

23:10 The one-eyed man looks briefly terrified as he sees you, then closes his eye and appears to concentrate, quickly fading from view.

23:10 Ather Jammoa removes a black surplus-design stun cannon from a black scorched metal thigh holster.

23:10 Blake Madison says, "What the hell was that."

23:10 Hawthorn Dunn says, "What..."

23:11 Keegan Wantz says, "Uhhh."

23:11 Ather Jammoa puts a black surplus-design stun cannon in a black scorched metal thigh holster.

23:11 Ather Jammoa removes a hyperspanner from a midnight blue backpack.

23:11 Ather Jammoa crouches down next to an unobtrusive panel and begins carefully unbolting it.

23:11 Keegan Wantz stands up.

23:11 Blake says to Keegan, "You didn't start the drive did you?"

23:11 Ather Jammoa says, "Check the ship."

23:11 Hawthorn Dunn stands up.

23:11 Keegan Wantz says, "No."

23:11 Keegan Wantz says, "Look around."

23:11 Keegan Wantz strides north.

23:11 Blake Madison stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

23:11 Ather Jammoa says, "I'll check the ducts."

23:11 Blake Madison asks, "Anyone got an extra weapon?"

23:11 Ather Jammoa lifts an unobtrusive panel and makes his way into the starship's network of system ducts.

23:11 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I don't have anything..."

23:11 Matteo Hapta says, "Me neither."

23:11 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'll look around though."

23:12 Matteo Hapta scrambles to his feet.

23:12 Matteo Hapta walks east.

23:12 Hawthorn Dunn ambles north.

23:12 Matteo Hapta walks in.

23:12 Blake Madison walks north.

23:12 Matteo Hapta walks north.

23:12 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "The ducts are clear."

23:12 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Copy."

23:13 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Was he looking at me, directly, before he faded?"

23:13 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I guess we could simply ask the guy to appear..."

23:13 OOC: Staff members should check to make sure you're in the rift before fucking with you.

23:13 Matteo Hapta walks in from the north.

23:14 Matteo Hapta sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

23:14 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Half a cycle left on charging, shall we continue?"

23:14 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

23:14 Keegan Wantz sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

23:14 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Only if I'm not going to be jumped by things? God how long have we been in this flying tin can."

23:15 Keegan Wantz says into the PA microphone, "Ship's clear, might've been a lingering entity or something."

23:15 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Lily."

23:15 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure. Umm. Yeah."

23:15 Ryan Thomas says, "Well."

23:15 Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the north.

23:15 Keegan Wantz scrambles to his feet.

23:15 Keegan Wantz strides north.

23:16 Hawthorn Dunn sits down.

23:16 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

23:16 Blake Madison walks in from the north.

23:16 Keegan Wantz strides north.

23:17 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

23:17 Keegan Wantz strides north.

23:17 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

23:17 Blake Madison says to Keegan Wantz, "Airlock too?"

23:17 Keegan Wantz sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

23:17 Keegan Wantz nods.

23:17 Keegan Wantz says, "Checked."

23:17 Blake Madison walks north.

23:17 Blake Madison walks in from the north.

23:17 Hawthorn Dunn says, "From outsider patrols to mind games from space. Wonderful."

23:18 Ryan Thomas says, "Well."

23:18 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Eh!"

23:18 Ryan Thomas says, "Welcome to the unknown."

23:18 Keegan Wantz says, "So, I have a horror story."

23:18 Keegan Wantz says, "One eyed man appears from nowhere."

23:18 Keegan Wantz says, "BOOM."

23:18 Hawthorn Dunn chortles.

23:18 Ryan Thomas says, "Oh dear."

23:18 Ryan Thomas says, "Maybe it's going to fight the person eating cake."

23:18 Ryan Thomas says, "He."

23:18 Ather Jammoa strides in from the north.

23:18 Keegan Wantz asks, "So, how many of you have heard the tale of Meteu Gamrey and the dread pirate Wantz?"

23:19 Ryan Thomas asks, "No?"

23:19 Matteo Hapta says, "Never heard of it."

23:19 Blake Madison says to Ather Jammoa, "Anyone in the control room? I don't like that being empty..."

23:19 Keegan Wantz says, "We have all the sensors back here, Blake."

23:19 Ather Jammoa says, "I intend to go back there."

23:19 Ather Jammoa says, "Jus twanted to do one last check."

23:19 Keegan Wantz nods.

23:19 Ather Jammoa strides north.

23:19 Keegan Wantz presses a button, calling up the starmap, and studies it for a moment.

23:19 Blake Madison presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

23:20 Slack-Jawed Reg Tourist Lily Kaise says, "What."

23:20 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Meteu Gamrey and the Dread Pirate Wantz, Lily!"
Slack-Jawed Reg Tourist Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Wha."

23:20 Keegan Wantz says, "I want to make a movie out of it some day."

23:20 Slack-Jawed Reg Tourist Lily Kaise blinks slowly, her thoughts turning inward.

23:20 Keegan Wantz stands up from a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

23:20 Slack-Jawed Reg Tourist Lily Kaise laughs.

23:21 Hawthorn Dunn says, "I'm so paranoid now."

23:21 Spreading his arms out wide, Keegan moves his right hand through the air. "One day, long ago, there was an innocent League pilot named Meteu Gamrey, who flew his starship around Space."

23:21 Hawthorn settles back and listens, smirking at thetheatrics.

23:22 Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu was, by all accounts, a perfeclty pleasant individual with a few imperfections. You see, he often enjoyed leaving his starships floating in space while he took naps."

23:22 Ryan Thomas says, "Oh dear."

23:22 Keegan Wantz puts a hyperspanner in a navy blue canvas backpack.

23:22 Keegan Wantz puts a copy of "QE Codes: Shorthand for Quantum Entanglement Messages" in a navy blue canvas backpack.

23:22 Keegan Wantz removes a pin badge that declares the wearer to obviously be Mister Kelsey from a leather portfolio.

23:22 Keegan Wantz puts on a pin badge that declares the wearer to obviously be Mister Kelsey.

23:22 Ryan Thomas laughs.

23:22 Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.

23:23 Ryan Thomas says, "I fought Mister Kelsey once, actually."

23:23 Ryan Thomas says, "But anyway."

23:23 Ryan Thomas says, "Keegan's first."

23:23 Clarina Taylor chortles.

23:23 Continuing to wave his right hand through the air, Keegan continues, "One of these times, a lovely Fringe pilot by the name of Keegan decided he would teach Meteu Gamrey a lesson."

23:23 Blake Madison sits down on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch.

23:23 Clarina tilts her head.

23:24 Stilling his hand, Keegan says, "So, one day when our lovely little Meteu stalled his ship in space, Keegan SWOOPED!" he brings his left hand close to his right, before saying, "Oh, I actually..."

23:24 Keegan Wantz removes an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods" from a navy blue canvas backpack.

23:24 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Ah, excellent!"

23:24 "Woo the hero of the story," Hawthorn cheers half heartedly, looking interested.

23:24 Holding an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods" in his right hand, Keegan moves his left hand towards the starship model.

23:24 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "SWOOPED IN!"

23:24 Keegan Wantz says, "Very slowly, mind you, he was using a throw-away flitter."

23:24 Hawthorn leans forward and nods. "mm."

23:25 Keegan Wantz says, "And painfully slowly."

23:25 Moving his hands at a glacial pace, Keegan opens the hatch on an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods".

23:25 Keegan Wantz says, "Cracked open the hatch."

23:25 Clarina Taylor says, "Oh dear."

23:25 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh boy..."

23:25 Keegan Wantz says, "And left Meteu Gamrey on the flitter."

23:26 Keegan Wantz says, "Before undocking, and flying the Heavy Launch Vessel off into space."

23:26 Clarina Taylor says, "I'm sure he was ecstatic."

23:26 Hawthorn Dunn chortles.

23:26 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Now, Meteu Gamrey was rightfully shocked!"

23:26 Keegan Wantz asks, "Who ever would take his precious Heavy Launch Vessel?"

23:27 Keegan Wantz says, "After having him wait for a few hours, Keegan Wantz revealed himself."

23:27 "Heh." Hawthorn Dunn arches an eyebrow. "I would've never said until he saw it flying around."

23:27 Clarina Taylor slumps on a soft azure blue knitted blanket and goes to sleep.

23:27 Ryan Thomas says, "Maybe that's how he revealed himself."

23:27 Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.

23:27 Puffing his chest out, Keegan says, "AH! METEU! It was I, Keegan, who took your starship! Let this be a lesson!"

23:28 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "For if you ever leave it in space again, I will take it for a longer period of time!"

23:28 Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu, chided, returned to his starship."

23:28 Keegan Wantz says, "But this tale is not at an end, for less than a week later, he did it again."

23:28 Ryan Thomas says, "Oh dear."

23:28 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "This time, it was right above Old Earth!"

23:29 Keegan Wantz says, "Keegan Wantz, being the benevolent man that he is, liberated that poor starship from Meteu Gamrey's neglectful hands."

23:29 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "But ho!"

23:29 Keegan points off towards the base block, and says, "A Nissi Valdaire did not approve!"

23:30 Keegan Wantz says, "You see, despite his noble goals, Keegan Wantz was technically commiting piracy."

23:30 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "The League would not stand for it! They wanted that starship returned immediately!"

23:30 Keegan Wantz says, "So Nissi chased, and Keegan ran."

23:30 Keegan Wantz says, "Until Keegan got bored."

23:30 Ryan Thomas asks, "Did keegan run in the heavy launch vessel?"

23:31 Rubbing at his chin lightly as he waves an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods" around in the air, Keegan says, "And he thought, 'Well, I intend to return this starship anyway, so let us make this a fun return!'"

23:31 Keegan Wantz says, "So he stopped for long enough for Nissi and Miah to dock."

23:31 Keegan Wantz says, "And Nissi borded his Confiscated Goods."

23:31 Keegan Wantz says, "Boarded, pardon."

23:32 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "And thus, Keegan and Nissi fought!"

23:32 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "They fought over the controls!"
Clarina Taylor suddenly awakens.

23:32 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "They punched eachother in the face!"

23:32 Ryan Thomas gasps.

23:32 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "Oh dear!"

23:32 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "There were several groin shots!"

23:32 Matteo Hapta blinks heavily and then dozes off.

23:32 Clarina Taylor says, "Sacrelige."

23:32 Keegan Wantz says, "Eventually, Keegan was tired of fighting, and simply said, 'Fine, fine! I'll stop.'"

23:32 Keegan Wantz says, "Nissi punched him anyway."

23:33 Keegan Wantz says, "One last time, for good measure."

23:33 Ryan Thomas chuckles.

23:33 Clarina wags her finger.

23:33 Lily Kaise snickers.

23:33 Keegan Wantz says, "And thus, the starship was returned to Meteu once again."

23:33 Matteo Hapta slumps on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa and goes to sleep.

23:34 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "But this tale is still not at an end!"

23:34 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "For once again, Meteu did the unthinkable!"

23:34 Ryan Thomas exclaims, "Of course he did!"

23:34 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "He left his starship in space!"

23:34 Clarina Taylor exclaims, "That bastard!"

23:34 Clarina Taylor smiles.

23:34 Keegan Wantz says, "And this time, Keegan was not feeling benevolent."

23:34 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "And so he took!"

23:34 Clarina Taylor asks, "What did this Keegan do?"

23:34 Keegan snatches an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods" with both hands, and shoves it into his backpack.

23:34 Keegan Wantz puts an intricate scale model of the LLV-H99 League Heavy Launch Vessel "Confiscated Goods" in a navy blue canvas backpack.

23:34 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "He took the starship!"

23:34 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "And he claimed it for his own!"

23:35 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Dubbing it Confiscated Goods, as Meteu's efforts to protect himself were lacking!"

23:35 Keegan Wantz says, "There was some huff and puff."

23:35 Keegan Wantz says, "But Keegan would not return the starship."

23:35 Clarina Taylor stands up from a soft azure blue knitted blanket.

23:35 Clarina Taylor wanders north.

23:35 Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

23:35 Clarina Taylor sits down on a soft azure blue knitted blanket.

23:35 Keegan Wantz says, "And he utilized it for a long while, making many profitable trade runs."

23:36 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "'PIRATE!' they cried!"

23:36 Keegan Wantz says, "But Keegan did not care."

23:36 Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu had brought this upon himself."

23:36 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "He was warned, warned, and warned again!"

23:36 Keegan Wantz says, "But this tale does end pleasantly for Meteu, in a way."

23:36 Keegan Wantz says, "You see, Keegan had a few friends."

23:37 Keegan Wantz says, "One Stephen Lanburn, at the time, had an idea."

23:37 Lily Kaise asks, "In low places?"

23:37 Lily Kaise grins.

23:37 Keegan Wantz says, "Conquest was starting, and we were originally competing."

23:37 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "So for the Glory of the Civilian Fleet, Keegan Wantz and Stephen Lanburn, as well as one of Keegan's ex ladyfriends attacked!"

23:38 Keegan Wantz says, "The League Navy."

23:38 Clarina Taylor says, "Ex lady friends."

23:38 Clarina Taylor grins.

23:38 Keegan Wantz says, "The poor League Navy."

23:38 Ryan Thomas says, "Oh god."

23:38 Lily Kaise says, "Oh my."

23:38 Keegan Wantz says, "Who were not a part of any of this."

23:38 Keegan Wantz says, "And thus, these pilots were blacklisted from League Space, for a very long time."

23:38 Clarina Taylor applauds sedately.

23:38 Keegan Wantz says, "But cooler heads prevailed."

23:38 Keegan Wantz says, "Eventually, the League and the Fringe reached an agreement."

23:38 Keegan Wantz says, "They would be allies."

23:39 Keegan Wantz says, "But the Fringe would not pirate League starships."

23:39 Keegan Wantz says, "And Keegan Wantz, as per the blacklisting, was forced to return his Confiscated Goods."

23:39 Ryan Thomas laughs.

23:39 Keegan Wantz says, "Meteu Gamrey, after all of that, had his ship once again."

23:39 Keegan Wantz bows.

23:39 Clarina Taylor asks, "Did he fall asleep again?"

23:39 Lily Kaise slumps on a soft cinnamon brown leather couch and goes to sleep.

23:40 Keegan Wantz says, "If he did, I did not take advantage of it."

23:40 Ryan Thomas says, "That was pretty awesome."

23:40 Clarina Taylor says, "We had a sleeper too for a time."

23:40 Clarina Taylor asks, "What was his name? I can't remember. WAs it Jack?"

23:40 Ryan Thomas says, "Might have been."

23:41 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

23:41 Keegan Wantz says, "Sec before you start your story, Ryan, gonna check charge."

23:41 Keegan Wantz says, "That one was a bit lengthy."

23:41 Keegan Wantz strides north.

23:41 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

23:41 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "Oh!"

23:41 Keegan Wantz says, "That was not the final starship that Keegan Wantz stole, however."

23:41 Keegan Wantz removes an intricate scale model of the AH-12 AEU Soothsayer-class Cruiser "Sol Invictus" from a navy blue canvas backpack.

23:41 Keegan Wantz says, "One day, Kaito Zalmont stopped paying attention in Mir."

23:42 Keegan Wantz says, "So Keegan Wantz stole a Soothsayer from Kaito and sold it to the Fringe government."

23:42 Keegan Wantz beams.

23:42 Ryan Thomas says, "Oh damn."

23:42 Clarina Taylor says, "Good lord."

23:42 Keegan Wantz puts an intricate scale model of the AH-12 AEU Soothsayer-class Cruiser "Sol Invictus" in a navy blue canvas backpack.

23:42 Ryan Thomas says, "So my story is not that exciting in the slightest."

23:42 Clarina Taylor stands up from a soft azure blue knitted blanket.

23:42 Clarina Taylor picks up a soft azure blue knitted blanket.

23:42 Clarina Taylor puts a soft azure blue knitted blanket in a large dark blue canvas duffel bag.

23:43 Ryan Thomas says, "But, I think it was Jonathan Gray who menchened pirates in Tesla."

23:43 Clarina Taylor asks, "Weren't there ifs first?"

23:43 Ryan Thomas shrugs.

23:43 Ryan Thomas says, "And he was up there with a shit load of them in a clipper by himself. And the mantice Julian decided it would be ok to give them shows up."

23:44 Ryan Thomas says, "And we get a crew together and go to tesla and start fighting the mantice. And well I just got mine, you see, so I was quite bad. And it was late and I mean it was my first real thing you know? It was more serious than the few fighters or the gunship we'd get. There were a lot."

23:44 Ryan Thomas says, "So I am losing. Badly. My crew was not best crew that day. Not in that fight."

23:44 Ryan Thomas says, "But anyway, we're near tesla so i'm like i'm gonna repair."

23:44 Clarina Taylor laughs.

23:45 Ryan Thomas says, "And I land and do the whole repair thing and go back up. And get hit with....something."

23:45 Ryan Thomas says, "I would have liked to put my starship up against Keegan's flitter in a race at that point, because it did something to the drive."

23:45 Hawthorn Dunn chuckles.

23:45 Keegan Wantz nods.

23:46 Ryan Thomas says, "And it just.....wouldn't move. like I think we could have walked faster to get out of the way. I thought surely we were done. But rather anticlimacticly, they unloaded a few times on us, jumped out and ever since then I'd kinda like a rematch."

23:46 Keegan Wantz says, "Ahahahaha."

23:46 Keegan Wantz says, "Probably a bolt."

23:46 Ryan Thomas says, "And oh man I wanted it bad for a while like, I would go hunt pirates wherever because I wanted another go at the mantice."

23:46 Clarina Taylor laughs at Ryan Thomas.

23:46 Ryan Thomas says, "And then Jonathan's ball came about and I heard Mister Kelsey made the news."

23:47 Clarina Taylor smiles.

23:47 Keegan Wantz says, "I would very much like to destroy that Mantis."

23:47 Clarina Taylor says, "Not the ball."

23:47 Ryan Thomas says, "So I checked and he stole the desert table and gave it to orphens."

23:47 Clarina Taylor asks, "WAs it the ball?"

23:47 Ryan Thomas says, "Dessert, even."

23:47 Ryan Thomas nods to Clarina Taylor.

23:47 Ryan says to Clarina, "I think so."

23:47 Keegan Wantz says, "Yeah, he yoinked the desserts."

23:47 Clarina Taylor says, "It was something fancy. That's where you gave my my ring."

23:47 Keegan Wantz says, "If I recall correctly."

23:47 Ryan Thomas nods.

23:47 Ryan Thomas says, "I'm pretty sure it was the ball."

23:47 Ryan Thomas says, "But anyway. I just, and still can't, bring myself to hate the guy after that."

23:48 Keegan Wantz says, "There's still plenty to dislike."

23:48 Ryan Thomas says, "I have no doubt."

23:48 Ryan Thomas says, "But that one thing. I'll always respect him for that."

23:49 Keegan Wantz nods.

23:49 Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Wait...he stole desserts?"

23:49 Ryan Thomas nods.

23:49 Clarina Taylor says, "Big ass cake."

23:49 Ryan Thomas says, "A whole table of them."

23:49 Keegan Wantz says, "Gave it to orphans."

23:49 Keegan Wantz gestures vaguely.

23:49 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, that's...kinda nice."

23:49 Ryan Thomas nods.

23:49 Keegan Wantz says, "He also routinely attacks and injures our merchants."

23:49 Keegan Wantz shrugs.

23:49 Ryan Thomas nods.

23:49 Hawthorn Dunn says, "That is rude as hell."

23:50 Clarina Taylor says, "It is rude."

23:50 Ryan Thomas says, "And he needs to get his for that, and the mantice."

23:50 Keegan says to Hawthorn, "So! How'd you almost burn down that kitchen?"

23:50 Ryan Thomas says, "But he does things like that. Gives dessert to orphens, helped us fight off IFS and outsiders..."

23:50 Ryan Thomas says, "But yes."

23:50 Hawthorn Dunn says, "So I was fifteen. Mom had to go into town to get supplies for the B and B, and so it was just me and my sisters."

23:51 Blake Madison says to Ryan, "He's a very interesting character. The whole Takana... incident proved that for me."

23:51 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Of course she tells me I'm on cook duty, and my family is known for doing good burgers. I mean I knew how to flip a burger since I was ten, but you know. I've never managed a whole grill of them, by myself when they're not there and it's just my sisters."

23:52 Hawthorn Dunn blinks.

23:52 Hawthorn says to Blake Madison, "Takana incident?"

23:52 Blake Madison says to Hawthorn, "Mm mmm keep going."

23:53 Hawthorn rubs his face with the knuckles of his hand. "Uh, right. So, anyway. My sister usually handled customers and it was my parents and I in the kitchen. I usually washed dishes. But that day, it was just me and as soon as she leaves we get a rush."

23:54 Hawthorn Dunn says, "So, We manage it and everything, and all, and there's so many burgers and a couple of steaks, and I keep having to run aroand look for the rolls cause everyone's real hungry that day."

23:56 Hawthorn Dunn says, "And so finally my sisters are about as frantic as I am, and one of the burgers gets way burnt, and I don't smell it until gets to the point where the grease trap goes up. We had like this old set up, real unsafe, think my parents got a fine or something for it. Had to get a new grill and smoke damage but. Yup it's like a cookout roasting hotdogs, save for it's in a kitchen and its a grill."

23:56 Keegan Wantz exclaims, "FWOOSH!"

23:57 Clarina Taylor says, "Indeed."

23:57 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Yup. Like mini mushroom cloud. Smoke everywhere, like I'm scrambling for the fire extinguisher, my sisters are calling me dipshit. Good times."

23:57 Keegan Wantz chuckles.

23:57 Keegan Wantz says, "Let's see.."

23:57 Keegan Wantz strides north.

23:57 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

23:57 Keegan Wantz says, "Almost done charging."

23:58 Hawthorn Dunn says, "My sisters still call me dipshit, when I do see them, though we don't talk much these days."

23:58 Keegan Wantz grins at Hawthorn Dunn.

23:58 Keegan Wantz strides north.

23:58 Keegan Wantz strides in from the north.

23:58 Clarina Taylor asks, "HOw many do you have?"

23:59 Keegan Wantz asks, "How many sisters?"
