Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

This room leads to the living quarters, and contains some additional amenities,
notably a tiny alcove containing a shower. A small keypad controls access to the
living quarters. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here.
Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a soft cinnamon brown leather couch, an overstuffed aquamarine sofa, a
small purple trash bin, a large crystal ball, a coffee table of highly polished
lunar basalt, and Kiska the humanoid service robot here.
Alko Delovega, Matteo Hapta, Simon Collins, and Tony Cross are sleeping on an

slowly.

The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall
rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.
A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the
starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting
platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash
and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The
scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the
ground.
Lily Kaise exclaims, "Phew make this go away!"
Clarina Taylor wanders in from the north.

The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is
blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you
before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you,
it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.
The viewports are suddenly obscured by billowing white clouds and the starship
trembles slightly as if entering an atmosphere. With a sudden jolt, the starship
splashes down and sinks into a crystal clear blue ocean.
Clarina Taylor smiles.
Lily Kaise says, "Wow what a contrast..."
The thrumming of the engines lessens as the starship's speed decreases.

purple sea fans and colorful fish zig-zagging through them.
Lily Kaise smiles.
The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling
mist.
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by
a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the
words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Hmmm."

[PA] Simon Collins: "Are we going for it?"
The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Yes, but I'm not expecting to need to image it."

we find too many already discovered things."
[PA] Keegan Wantz: "Indeed, but we don't know if it's already discovered or
not."
The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship
has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

The starship has entered a unique area of space.
Stars appear to twinkle as on a clear night on a planet. But this is no
atmospheric effect. The starship's mass sensors reveal a number of large
floating objects here -- asteroids, all rotating at various speeds, some
alternating a light and dark side and producing the twinkling effect.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked
forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of
existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.
The starship shudders briefly as a probe is loaded from the racks into the
launch tube, then deployed.

Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.
A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual
deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every
direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar,
occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.
The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien
landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the
planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.
