-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo ch
00:36:07 ow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

01:13:41 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "My white soldiers are turning into red kitties."

01:40:28 You stand up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:40:30 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:40:30 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:40:30 You exit the ship.
[New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

01:40:32  You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of slim blue stone linen trousers, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side, and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

01:40:32 You are carrying nothing.

01:40:39 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

01:40:39 The scout "AEU Navy Honour Guard Scout Omega-8" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

01:40:40 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]
You see a trash can, a long white plasteel bench, and a sanitation drone here.
Eli Grey is sitting on a long white plasteel bench. Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go east and west.

01:40:41 Lily Kaise waves to Eli Grey.

01:40:44 Lily says to Eli, "Hey."

01:40:47 You salute Eli Grey.

01:40:52 Eli Grey says, "Yes, but ther's no walls and we can keep our voices down."

01:41:01 Eli Grey says, "It'll al be public soon enough."

01:41:05 Eli Grey smiles.

01:41:07 You say to Eli, "[1."

01:41:07 I don't understand that.

01:41:09 Lily Kaise says, "But there are a lot of eager elephant ears."

01:41:12 Lily Kaise laughs.

01:41:21 You say to Eli, "I didn't do it."

01:41:24 Eli Grey asks, "Well, ok. Do you have a better place in mind?"

01:41:27 Lily Kaise points at you.

01:41:30 Eli Grey laughs.

01:41:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods east.

01:41:47 Lily Kaise asks, "Ok then what's going on?"

01:42:03 [New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]

01:42:03 This clean white bridge spans the gap between the spaceport proper to the west and the landing pad to the east. Hundreds of feet below you, the blue waters of Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. The bridge itself is constructed of concrete gracefully shaped into smooth, curving lines, with new silver railings and bushy green potted plants set out at intervals to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the structure. Though pilots and travelers often hurry through the area, many others pause at the railings to enjoy the fine view of their surroundings. A small archway leads to a set of concrete steps leading all the way down to the water.
You see a trash can and a long white plasteel bench here.
Eli Grey is sitting on a long white plasteel bench. Lily Kaise is standing here.
You can go east and west.

01:42:09 Eli Grey says, "I'm going to be doing a broadcast tomorrow night, I was hoping around 23:00 if that's alright. I'd really like it if you guys could be there."

01:42:21 Lily Kaise says, "I can't guarantee that I can be."

01:42:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:42:31 Eli says to Lily, "Would a different time be better?"

01:42:32 You say, "Neither can I, but I'll do my best."

01:42:35 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

01:42:36 Lily Kaise says, "Im generally here after 2300 and sometimes as late as 2330."

01:42:57 Eli Grey asks, "Ah, so maybe midnight would be better?"

01:43:03 Lily Kaise says, "It would."

01:43:07 You nod.

01:43:18 "Consider it doen then." Eli Grey nods. "I haven't purchased the slot yet."

01:43:23 Lily Kaise says, "Oh good."

01:43:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into a small archway leading to a set of concrete steps.

01:43:48 Lily Kaise asks, "So are you going to be solo or do you want AEU pilot guests there?"

01:43:52 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Awwww, I have a feathered felo kitten that is red."

01:43:55 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Eli, did you hear my request to come to Earth and bring Oracle key?"

01:44:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Eva!"

01:44:13 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "Yo."

01:44:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Yes?"

01:44:19 Eli Grey says, "You guys don't have to speak if you don't want to, but I'll be handing out some images that I would like you guys to hold up."

01:44:19 [General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yo Hakeem."

01:44:22 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey."

01:44:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi!"

01:44:26 Lily Kaise says, "Sure."

01:44:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:44:34 Eli Grey says, "Oh, please come. The more of us that are there the better."

01:44:35 A sanitation drone slips a white glove onto a mechanical hand and rubs a finger along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

01:44:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Hey."

01:44:39 Lily Kaise says, "'ok."

01:44:43 You say, "Ok."

01:45:04 Eli Grey says, "It will be a brief broadcast, probably less than thirty minutes, but it should get the point across."

01:45:14 Eli Grey says, "Less than that, depending on how many Iget to come."

01:45:15 You nod. "Ok."

01:45:30 Eli Grey asks, "Can you guys spread the word? Quietly for now, of course?"

01:45:30 Lily Kaise says, "I am glad it's tomorrow but the next day I won't likely be here for awhile."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into a small archway leading to a set of concrete steps.

01:45:43 Eli Grey says, "Ah, then we'll be doing it just in time."

01:45:48 Lily says to Eli, "Might put a note on General?"

01:45:58 Lily Kaise asks, "Or you don't want to go that public?"

01:46:14 Eli Grey says, "I will, but I will wait till tomorrow for that, the less time they have to prepare a responde, the better."

01:46:19 Eli Grey says, "Er.. a response."

01:46:24 Lily Kaise nods.

01:46:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:46:54 Eli Grey says, "I sent the minutes of the meeting and the document to the press, but it didn't get much coverage."

01:47:21 Eli looks relieved, "i'm so glad you guys will be able to make it"

01:47:24 Lily Kaise asks, "Ur meeting with Lambeth?"

01:47:27 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

01:47:27 I don't see that here.

01:47:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into a small archway leading to a set of concrete steps.

01:47:31 You nod and smile.

01:47:32 Eli Grey says, "The meeting we were all at."

01:47:41 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah and nobody even acknowledged our statement."

01:48:00 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise. "It seems as though it's being covered up a bit."

01:48:13 Eli Grey says, "And sadly,  there's no legal action that can be taken, I checked."

01:48:26 Lily Kaise says, "Yes and it sure sheds a bad light on the rest of us because we all believe just the opposite."

01:48:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:48:33 You nod.

01:48:36 You say, "Exactly."

01:48:44 Evangeline Adaire glides in from the east.

01:48:45 Evangeline Adaire glides west.

01:49:07 "Wel, you'll get your chance tomorrow night." Eli Grey nods. "I'd like to avoid using Bests name if posible. If we do that the folks who support him will simply shut the holo off. We need to get through to th em as well."

01:49:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods east.

01:49:56 Lily Kaise says, "I don't mind epressing my thoughts right here. Just as ather shut me out of the other statement about the crimes towards others. I was in support of that statement as well but it gave all of the haters like Aisling and Anfisa something which was totally wrong."

01:50:14 Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.

01:50:38 Eli Grey says, "You won't be shut out on this. This concerns all of us."

01:50:55 Eli Grey says, "I don't intend to be that kind of Voice."

01:51:24 Evangeline Adaire glides in from the west.

01:51:25 Evangeline Adaire glides east.

01:51:37 Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

01:51:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Eva, you be around tomorrow around midnight?"

01:51:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "HWhatcha need?"

01:51:54 Lily Kaise says, "I just didn't want to face the redicule of two individuals who are kim Saunders and Ather Jammoa who didn't express a single word that I should come back into comms until it dawned on them that the AEU wasn't looking very good yet I came back within a day. I wasn't aboard my own ship and I would have had we not been headed to get johann's upgrade on Tom town."

01:52:14 Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

01:52:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Can you come back to the bridge for just a moment, I'll be very brief."

01:52:25 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

01:52:31 Evangeline Adaire glides in from the east.

01:52:32 Evangeline Adaire nods.

01:52:37 Evangeline Adaire sits down on a long white plasteel bench.

01:52:40 You hug Evangeline Adaire.

01:52:45 Evangeline Adaire hugs you.

01:52:49 You smile.

01:52:54 Evangeline Adaire asks, "What do you need?"

01:52:56 Eli says to Lily, "Well that's all in the past now. I don't know too much about all that."

01:52:58 Lily Kaise says, "WEll I'm glad you are representing us. I simply am not at work anymore so I'm gla dyou have the position eli."

01:53:06 You say to Evangeline, "He just needs your soul. Not much."

01:53:07 Lily Kaise nods to Eli Grey.

01:53:10 Evangeline Adaire chuckles.

01:53:12 Evangeline Adaire says, "Alright."

01:53:17 You chuckle.

01:53:18 Evangeline Adaire says, "It's nearly gone anyway."

01:53:30 Lily Kaise grins at Evangeline Adaire.

01:53:43 Eli says to Evangeline, "I'm doing a public broadcast toorrow night. Iw ould like as many Union pilots there as I can get. You don't have to speak if you don't ant to but just being there will show support."

01:53:45 Evangeline smiles and leans back against a long white plasteel bench.

01:53:54 Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Ugh my stupid keyboard."

01:54:14 Evangeline nods her head, smiling. "I'll be there. Thank you Eli." She raises a hand to press it to her hair.

01:54:18 Eli says to Evangeline, "It's concerning the Union pulling out of the Accord. A sort of last ditch effort to reach the people about it."

01:54:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:54:33 Evangeline says to you, "I know. I don't like it."

01:54:35 A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

01:54:57 "I don't like that we are thinking of pulling out at all." Evangeline murmurs with a sideways glance.

01:55:04 Lily Kaise nods to Evangeline Adaire.

01:55:08 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

01:55:09 You nod to Evangeline Adaire.

01:55:18 You say, "We all don't like it."

01:55:24 Lily Kaise asks, "Eva did anyone show you the sttement we sent via Kim to the liaison?"

01:55:28 Evangeline Adaire asks, "And Best just thinks we agree on it?"

01:55:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into a small archway leading to a set of concrete steps.

01:55:36 Eli Grey says, "We've all already tried it through the official channels and it's doen no good. So it's time to make our voices heard."

01:55:47 Lily Kaise says, "Absolutely."

01:55:49 "I agree." Evangeline Adaire nods. "And no, I do not believe anyone showed me."

01:55:51 Eli says to Evangeline, "He knows we don't. He just doesn't care."

01:55:52 Shule nods emphatically.

01:56:14 Evangeline nods her head, frowning slightly. "I see." she says with a soft sigh, tugging at her hair.

01:56:17 Lily Kaise removes a small sparkly light purple portfolio from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:56:25 Evangeline Adaire asks, "What will this mean for the people in which we call our friends?"

01:56:28 Lily Kaise puts a small sparkly light purple portfolio in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:56:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

01:56:31 Lily Kaise removes a small black leather portfolio from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

01:56:35 A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.

01:57:00 Evangeline Adaire asks, "I know the mutuality does not like us, but if we become separated from the accord, waht will happen to us as a whole?"

01:57:10 Eli says to Evangeline, "I honestly do not know. I suppose there's a possiblity of getting rogued, but I highly doubt it. There will be no doubt that we have only the Union's best intentions at heart."

01:57:18 Eli says to Evangeline, "Oh, you mean that."

01:57:22 Lily Kaise removes a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" from a small black leather portfolio.

01:57:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.

01:57:31 Evangeline nods her head. "I do. Yes."

01:57:53 Eli Grey says, "Well, to be honest, that will likely be fine. We'll still be able to do all the things we do now. But pulling out will only weaken the Accord and the AEU, and that's a disaster."

01:57:55 Lily says to Evangeline, "Ok this is my only copy but here read this."

01:58:01 Lily Kaise gives a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" to Evangeline Adaire.

01:58:14 Evangeline nods her head and takes the paper, reading it over before she responds to anything else.

01:58:27 Eli says to Evangeline, "You'll still be able to buy upgrades and fly with other pilots. No worries about that."

01:59:04 Lily Kaise says, "'yep we'll just lose points and be frowned on by the government but we must do what is right."

01:59:11 Shaking her head, braid tinkling, Evangeline nods distracted to a thin gray filtration mask as she reads, commenting, "My biggest concern is what will happen to us as a whole."

01:59:19 Lily Kaise nods.

01:59:23 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

01:59:27 Evangeline Adaire asks, "Lose points? Truly?"

01:59:30 Lily Kaise says, "Yep."

01:59:34 Evangeline shakes her head and purses her lips.

01:59:42 Lily Kaise says, "Roguing does take away a bit of status."

01:59:48 Eli Grey says, "I doubt we will lose points. But I won't completely discredit that possiblity."

02:00:03 Evangeline chuckles. "I do not think it will come to rogue."

02:00:14 Lily Kaise says, "Well others have in the past I guess it depends upon the severety of their punishment of us."

02:00:15 Eli Grey says, "Best will not be happy, but rogueing us will only add weight to our words."

02:00:22 Lily Kaise says, "Sure will."

02:00:27 Eli Grey nods.

02:00:38 You nod.

02:01:08 Eli Grey says, "This is why I don't want to make it about him either. This neds to only be about the Union pulling out of the Accord, nothing else. My speech doesn't mention Best one time."

02:01:19 Evangeline nods her head as she hands a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" back to Lily. "There you are. I'll be there if time permits. It will be at midnight, you say?"

02:01:25 Evangeline Adaire gives a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" to Lily Kaise.

02:01:28 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

02:01:30 Eli Grey smiles.

02:01:31 Lily Kaise says, "It's all right. I stand by my commitment to do what is right and truly right by our citizens."

02:01:33 Evangeline nods to a thin gray filtration mask.

02:01:44 Evangeline Adaire says, "Alright."

02:01:49 Lily Kaise puts a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" in a small black leather portfolio.

02:01:50 Eli Grey says, "I wil not hold it against any of you if decide to back out."

02:02:04 Lily Kaise says, "Heh I sure won't."

02:02:06 Eli Grey smiles at Lily Kaise.

02:02:10 Lily Kaise puts a small black leather portfolio in a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:02:12 You say, "I won't."

02:02:19 Evangeline nods her head. "Thank you for bringing this to my attention."

02:02:27 Eli says to Evangeline, "Absolutely."

02:02:33 Evangeline Adaire stands up from a long white plasteel bench.

02:02:39 Evangeline Adaire asks, "Who all do you think will be there?"

02:02:56 Eli Grey says, "Hopefully,  everyone. I still need to talk to Constatine, and Vernos."

02:03:07 Evangeline nods her head. "Fair enough. Thank you."

02:03:10 Eli Grey says, "Ather will likely not be able to make it."

02:03:14 Eli Grey shrugs.

02:03:18 Eli Grey says, "He's done enough already."

02:03:21 Lily Kaise says, "Wow that is unfortunate."

02:03:25 "He never is able to make it." Evangeline murmurs. "As long as we have his support."

02:03:35 Eli Grey grins at Evangeline Adaire.

02:03:41 Evangeline smiles.

02:03:44 Eli Grey says, "Well, he did draft that document, so that helps."

02:03:49 You nod.

02:04:08 Lily Kaise says, "That's true so I know it doesn't mean he isn't behind this."

02:04:12 Evangeline nods her head. "This is true. If Best goes through with it anyway, then we should say that he is not looking at the union's interest as a whole."

02:04:30 Eli Grey says, "Try to be there at least half an hour earlier if you can, even just a few minutes. So that we can get our ducks in a row, as they say."

02:04:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:04:31 Evangeline Adaire says, "If you will excuse me, however, I have some work to do."

02:04:37 Evangeline Adaire nods.

02:04:38 Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.

02:04:42 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah will do my best."

02:04:45 Eli says to Evangeline, "Thanks for your time."

02:04:46 Lily Kaise says, "Ugh."

02:04:49 Evangeline Adaire says, "I will most likely not speak, as I am not good with public speaking as a whole."

02:04:59 Lily Kaise says, "I will make the utmost effort to be there."

02:05:07 You say, "As will I."

02:05:08 Eli Grey gives Lily Kaise a thumbs up!

02:05:13 Lily Kaise says, "I don't even want to use a certain word anymore."

02:05:22 Eli Grey grins at Lily Kaise.

02:05:26 Lily Kaise grins at Eli Grey.

02:05:30 A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:05:31 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into a small archway leading to a set of concrete steps.

02:05:43 Eli Grey says, "Fantastic. Looking forward to seeing you folks there."

02:05:52 You wave to Eli Grey.

02:05:57 Turning to walk down the bridge, the older woman pushes her hair back over her shoulder and moves to the landing pad, a frown creasing her face. Evangeline's fingers remain in her hair as she walks.

02:06:02 Evangeline Adaire glides east.

02:06:04 Lily Kaise says, "I'm looking forward to our making a statement."

02:06:30 Lily Kaise glances around at her surroundings.

02:06:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.

02:06:46 Eli Grey says, "Damn.. I think we were overheard."

02:06:49 Eli Grey sighs.

02:06:52 Eli Grey says, "This was my fault."

02:07:01 Lily Kaise asks, "Wait how?"

02:07:30 A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.

02:07:37 Lily Kaise says, "I mean Kim was still in office a few days into your trip and she had little to say."

02:07:51 Lily Kaise says, "I was very frustrated."

02:08:26 Eli Grey says, "I'm not sure she knew what to do."

02:08:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

02:08:56 Lily Kaise says, "Well she oculd have discussed it with us and I even sent her at least one letter urging her to do something."

02:09:26 You wave to Eli Grey. "I will do my best to be there tomorrow."

02:09:30 Eli Grey nods to you.

02:09:32 Lily Kaise nods.

02:09:37 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

02:09:37 The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 689" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

02:09:38 You can't go that way.

02:09:38 You can't go that way.

02:09:39 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]

02:09:39 You can go up.

02:09:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

02:09:42 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

02:09:42 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

02:09:43 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator, a hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

02:09:45 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:10:11 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:10:13 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

02:10:21 Lily Kaise sits down on your lap.

02:10:28 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

02:10:31 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:10:31 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

02:10:39 Lily Kaise says, "I'm afraid Love."

02:10:47 You sigh. "Me too."

02:11:57 Lily Kaise says, "Still, I feel that I must face it all and not hesitate to express my opposition to this action."

02:12:11 You nod. "We still need to make sure our voice is heard."

02:12:21 Lily Kaise says, "Yes no matter the risk."

02:12:32 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

02:12:33 You nod.

02:13:12 Lily Kaise says, "If this is all that I can do in my career as a pilot, I must because this is so important for the welfare of every AEU citizen."

02:13:23 Shule nods in agreement.

02:15:17 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 373,768.00 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Home Beacon Gamma 001.

02:21:01 Say to whom?

02:22:31 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a string of light purple plastic kelp.

02:30:30 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

02:38:40 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic flower with red petals.

02:38:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

02:54:31 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

02:55:24 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Erm.. this is a silly question, but what is the date of today? As of midnight?"

02:55:49 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wait.. I have a chronometer. duh."

02:57:22 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Can you come to Earth?"

02:57:37 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "I do like felo."

02:57:40 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sure, give me just a minute."

02:57:59 [General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You'd love little blue. Make sure you pet him if you see him."

02:58:30 A large thickly-shelled creature with a red shell and four small claws beats its claws together.

03:00:02 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Just so I don't make a silly mistake here. It's July 20th right now, but at midnight tomorrow it ill be the 21st."

03:00:11 [General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Yep."

03:00:20 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ok."

03:00:22 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Unless it's the 23rd instead."

03:00:30 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Or maybe the 24th."

03:00:50 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "We're skipping the 22nd, due to lack of interest."

03:00:58 [General Communication] Johann Schraft chuckles.

03:04:30 A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

03:08:30 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles propels itself through the tank, stirring up tiny particles.

03:10:31 A long red soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

03:12:31 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

03:16:30 [General Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Hi."

03:16:44 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:16:49 Lily Kaise kisses you.

03:16:52 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

03:16:52 I don't see "lily o lips" here.

03:16:59 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

03:17:27 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

03:18:31 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:24:31 A short amethyst soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

03:26:15 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Anyone know if it was Outsiders that destroyed the Telex spaceport? Or was it from the terrorists?"

03:26:30 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That was before my time, that's why I'm asking."

03:26:46 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:26:53 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

03:38:01 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Nope, they say they don't carry green drink."

03:38:31 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior pulsates gently.

03:38:35 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Well too bad. You'll have to wait til that excited guy comes back on ssn."

03:38:40 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Think I'm going to go for some irish whiskey."

03:39:02 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't always drink, so not always sure what I'll like. It's fun to try new things though."

03:39:20 [General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Whiskey is disgusting."

03:39:34 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "All depends on what you mix it with and in what proportions."

03:39:51 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think all they serve here is shots."

03:47:11 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Someone."

03:47:30 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hmm.. they make pretty good bourbon in this Kentucky place, wherever that is."

03:47:53 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "But that would shock and overload my innocent eyes and mind."

03:47:55 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The man on SSN said they're incredible Shule, isn't that endorsement enough?"

03:47:57 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "He gets enough burboun in him he might go for it."

04:13:48 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

04:13:54 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pretty purple halterneck top with a ruffled neckline, a pair of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the back left pocket, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold rin
04:13:54 g inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, back, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

04:14:16 Lily Kaise says, "I thought I did buy one one time but I honestly haven't found it yet."

04:14:16 You ask, "Hmmm, what?"

04:14:24 You say, "Oh."

04:14:27 Lily Kaise grins.

04:14:32 You grin.

04:14:34 You say, "Hmm."

04:14:41 You say, "No idea where you put it."

04:14:44 You grin.

04:14:58 Lily Kaise says, "I haven't worn a lot of things because you have always been so conservative about how I thought you felt I should dress."

04:15:03 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:15:31 You say, "Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to be coservative..."

04:15:38 Lily Kaise exclaims, "I had these nice halter tops but yes I am wearing one this morning!"

04:15:42 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:15:57 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:17:02 You say to Lily, "I like you in this kind of top."

04:17:08 Lily Kaise says, "Oh."

04:17:51 Lily Kaise says, "I guess I have felt a bit uncertain since you didn't like for me to drssin anything more revealing when I went to the NQ party that time."

04:18:15 You say, "Oh, that was because of where we were in our relationship. I don't mind now."

04:20:32 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:21:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Heres the thing with that statement."

04:21:08 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok you maniacs I'm going to catch some sleep."

04:21:59 Lily Kaise says, "You know I would never wear revealing clothing to attract anyone but you my Love."

04:22:03 Lily Kaise grins.

04:22:06 You grin.

04:22:19 You say, "I know."

04:22:26 You say, "That's why I don't mind."

04:22:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "There has to be a balance."

04:22:32 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it's kind of sad we didn't make it. I hope that for the next one, we'll be able to attend."

04:23:17 You nod and smile at Lily Kaise. "And if we do, I want to take off of you as much as I can."

04:23:30 Lily Kaise giggles at you.

04:24:10 You say, "I'd strip you completelyif I could."

04:24:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'll use my theory as an example, if Aisling recieved stolen parts to help her family then its less about the property that was stolen and more that someone has to answer for the value of the property."

04:24:14 You say, "Completely."

04:24:16 You grin.

04:24:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Sure it helped human life for them but a theft is a theft."

04:25:31 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah I don't really think what Aisling was about was totally up and up. I know nothing about the details but yeah there is something very ugly about that woman and we already know how conniving and selfish she is."

04:25:39 You nod.

04:25:41 You say, "I know."

04:25:50 Lily Kaise says, "Which is one reason I'm glad we weren't involved."

04:25:54 You nod.

04:26:22 You say to Lily, "Will you let me strip you ext year at the Q party if we can make it?"

04:26:40 Lily Kaise says, "You know I love every opportunity to travel out into the unknown but the fact that it was with unregged and not just an unreg pilot."

04:26:54 "Of course!" Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:26:55 [General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Damn fucking straight."

04:27:29 You nod and grin at Lily Kaise.

04:27:47 Lily Kaise asks, "But I wonder what Vernos is really going on about. Was there or has there been accusations of theft on her part?"

04:27:59 You say, "I have no idea."

04:29:00 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:29:20 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:31:27 [MTTS] Ulias: Pilot's rest on Telex should totaly be added to the lounge list for communicators, in my humble opinion.

04:32:51 [MTTS] Squidmind: Done.

04:33:31 [MTTS] Squidmind: Feel free to suggest other lounges to be added to the pilot locator via the support ticket system! We're more than happy to add ones that we've missed.

04:34:11 [MTTS] lunarfang: Is brights bar on tandem station there? Or does that not really count?

04:34:14 You say to Lily, "Seriously though, dress as sexy as you want."

04:34:31 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and an orange glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a shark.

04:34:31 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:34:42 You say, "I love seeing look sexy."

04:34:56 You say, "I love seeing you look sexy."

04:35:07 Lily Kaise says, "Well I am not one who will think that i'm going to dress one way all of the time except yes I do tend to want to dress comfortably."

04:35:12 Lily Kaise grins at you.

04:35:12 [MTTS] Squidmind: It was in the first lineup of locations to be added.

04:35:34 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:36:05 You say, "I think we're both secure enough in our relatioship that we're not worried about things like that."

04:36:10 You say, "Relationship."

04:37:02 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah Love and you know, when you smile at another woman, yes I am more secure in what we have to know that you are truly being friendly and not flirty."

04:37:09 You grin.

04:37:10 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:37:15 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:38:04 [MTTS] Ulias: Awesome thanks.

04:38:13 Your communicator reports that...

04:38:13

At least one recently active pilot is relaxing at Telex-Providence Spaceport; Pilot's Rest.

04:38:33 Lily Kaise grins.

04:38:56 You say, "And I know if you flash or whatever, it's for my benefit."

04:38:59 You smile.

04:41:02 [MTTS] Ulias: This is an underused spot, I'm glad it got added. There's a few more but I won't be able to think of them until i'm back in them heheh.

04:41:09 Lily Kaise pulls up a pretty purple halterneck top with a ruffled neckline, pulls down a dark purple satin demi bra slightly, and exposes her slightly larger than average naturally shaped breasts tipped with prominent rosy nipples for a moment.

04:41:19 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

04:41:24 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

04:41:26 You cheer.

04:41:42 You pull up a soft red heather cotton polo and expose your wide bare chest and small dark nipples for a moment.

04:43:29 Lily Kaise whistles at you.

04:44:27 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:44:34 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:47:22 You say, "Obviously, if there's a lot of touching involved, then I'd start to get worried, but I know you know that."

04:47:56 Lily Kaise exclaims, "Yeah and you know my thoughts on all but one of the pilots in this universe!"

04:48:00 Lily Kaise giggles at you.

04:48:03 You grin.

04:48:15 Lily Kaise says, "Call me a snob."

04:48:19 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:49:35 Lily Kaise says, "I was just brought up to cherish values and ethical behavior. It's not that we didn't allow liberties as you know I loved to swim naked in the ocean but I wouldn't have done so from a public beach."

04:49:49 You nod and smile.

04:50:30 Lily Kaise says, "I wish I could take you to visit my family and that we could swim together in the ocean with nothing on and I wish we could make love in the ocean."

04:50:39 Lily Kaise beams at you.

04:50:40 You grin at Lily Kaise.

04:50:44 You exclaim, "That'd be fun!"

04:50:50 Lily Kaise exclaims, "It would be wonderful!"

04:51:58 You say, "My philosophy has always been, if youwouldn't like the other person to do it, then don't do it yourself. So, if you wouldn'tlike your partner being touched by others in certain places, then don't do it yourself."

04:54:54 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Cogadh is being played in Earth lounge for those wishing to play or observe traditional game of my people."

04:55:19 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

04:55:23 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

04:55:35 Lily says to you, "I love you so so so much."

04:55:46 You say to Lily, "I love youso so so much too!"

04:55:49 You say, "You."

04:56:23 Lily Kaise says, "Too bad we can't go over on New Phoenix beach and swim naked in the ocean. Sad but we would be arrested and thrown in prison."

04:56:29 You say, "I know."

04:56:33 You say, "Tooo bad."

04:56:52 You say, "Well, you could wear a string bikini. It's shows a lot."

04:57:22 You say, "It's probably as close to naked as they'll allow you."

04:59:22 You ask, "When did you want to go up to NQ next?"

05:00:31 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a yellow glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

05:02:07 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

05:02:20 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

05:02:41 You ask, "So, when did you want to go to NQ?"

05:02:45 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, sorry I'm missing out. Remember, the trick is to go for Morris."

05:02:49 Lily Kaise says, "Hmm."

05:03:35 Lily Kaise says, "I probably could this weekend. I need to look in the Range office and be certain there's nothing which needs our attention and if we can take care of it beforehand we'd do that."

05:04:03 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:04:07 You nod.

05:04:09 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:04:26 Lily Kaise says, "Would that work for you."

05:04:33 You say, "Yeah."

05:04:36 You say, "It will."

05:05:14 Lily Kaise says, "I'd sure love to get in a beacon or two this conquest but it may just not happen with the Broadcast tomorrow."

05:05:36 Lily Kaise says, "Oh won't heh."

05:05:37 You say, "Yeah, we should do a couple at least."

05:05:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:05:57 You nod.

05:06:43 Lily Kaise asks, "Wow I would like to get Old Frontier cleared tomorrow too so I suppose if it doesn't go on too late, would you be up for cleansing it?"

05:06:54 You say, "Sure."

05:07:00 I don't understand that.

05:07:03 The AEU reached the first tier performance goal only.

05:07:03 Top Performers: Constantine Stone, Vernos Bailey, and Jathom Stishim.
The current Conquest period began 3 days, 3 hours, 6 minutes, and 47 seconds ago. The period will end in 20 hours, 52 minutes, and 57 seconds.

05:07:16 Lily Kaise says, "Ok we'll do that. It's not a lot of pay but the ground isn't terrible."

05:07:23 You nod.

05:07:40 Lily Kaise says, "I probably should go back to paying for participation."

05:08:03 Lily Kaise says, "Still, I'd rather people came to assist because they wanted to."

05:08:08 You nod.

05:08:40 You say, "Let's go lie down babe."

05:09:03 Lily Kaise says, "Ok Love. I should find Asteria and feed her if she is awake so I may be a few."

05:09:08 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:09:09 You say, "Ok."

05:09:11 You kiss Lily Kaise.

05:09:11 Lily Kaise stands up from your lap.

05:34:21 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:34:25 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

05:34:47 Lily says to you, "You know I do love our intamacy and I think we've discussed this before. I am rather traditional and I, knowing that certain openings of the human anatomy aren't suited for certain penetration, will never ask you to engage in anal sex."

05:34:56 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:35:08 You smile at Lily Kaise. "That's fine. I'm prefectly happy with our intimacy."

05:36:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "So much for not embarrassing the AEU, eh Vernos?"

05:36:38 Lily Kaise says, "Well I hope so. I suppose if you really said that it would be important to you, I would try most anything though. It's that you know I come from a line of medical professionals and otherwise and there are certain health risks, even in this day and age of everything can likely be cured, that I just don't prefer to go there."

05:36:50 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

05:36:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Don't start with me over a theory discussed between two folks."

05:36:54 I don't see "lilyon lips" here.

05:36:58 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

05:37:13 You say, "I'm happy with what we do."

05:37:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "You'll get a quick bite me and a fuck you if you do."

05:37:28 You say, "As long as you feel satisfied, I'm happy."

05:37:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I very much doubt it's a theory. It's weird. First you claimed not to have sent a letter, and now you're saying that it's just a theory?"

05:38:12 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:38:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What's going on here? Vernos you keep making all of these random statements."

05:38:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But, if you want to resort to childish behavior instead of doing the right thing, well, that's all o nyou. You'll just go down into the embarrassment files like the slavers."

05:38:38 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:38:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "How true."

05:38:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh please."

05:38:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Oh please what? Are the slavers just a theory now too?"

05:39:15 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:39:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "They truly are not. They are documented."

05:39:56 You smile at Lily Kaise.

05:40:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I sent a letter about a theory I had, that I had discussed with another pilot because the timing looked suspecious. I refuse to be beat on by pilots on that trip until it is determined I am incorrect."

05:40:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sounds to me like you're just throwing a tantrum cause youw eren't invited."

05:41:16 Lily Kaise grins at you.

05:41:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh please, I didnt really give a fuck and spent the time salvaging and meeting personal goals. Did you get that line from Cheri."

05:41:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "She already tried that one."

05:41:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "No actually I haven't seen Cheri today. I guess it's obvious though to anyone capable of human thought."

05:42:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Now, for the promised part."

05:42:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Fuck you."

05:42:44 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:42:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Wow that took a lot of exceptional inteulect to make that statement."

05:42:52 Lily Kaise kisses you.

05:42:59 Lily Kaise says, "Wow he is a nut case."

05:43:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well, I guess I will just congratulate you for being the new village idiot. Hope it's a good throne to be on for now. Enjoy!"

05:43:13 You say to Lily, "I'll never do activites you are uncomfortable with. And yes, he is."

05:43:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Know what I think. I think I'm onto something and a lot of really vetern pilots are getting nervious."

05:43:21 You say, "Activities."

05:43:34 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:43:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "No just annoyed with your prattal."

05:43:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Really now."

05:43:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I wonder what you knew if I am indeed correct."

05:44:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "If those parts were stolen, I wonder if you knew it and went along anyways."

05:44:27 You kiss Lily Kaise softly on the stomach.

05:44:31 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:44:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Just note it and move on tr 1 Do you truly think Ather would have any control over that and truly give a flying fuck?"

05:44:38 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:44:42 You laugh.

05:45:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Personally, I doubt you folks would be so defensive if there was nothing to it."

05:45:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You're acting like the president you ended up not voting for. Since you too don't seem to care about the things Frolov said to Best regarding human life."

05:45:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Calling names, going around and saying stupid and village idiot."

05:45:43 You say, "Seriously Vernos, stop while you're ahead."

05:46:30 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:46:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh I have nothing to be defensive over. I'm just annoyed with your random bullshit and the fact that you did something rather obtuse and very questionable really clearly indicates that you yourself has more to defend."

05:46:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Human life is valuable, but theft is theft and if it is true then laws hold value too."

05:46:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Eli Grey transmits, "Pilots, please. We don't need this right now."

05:47:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh fuck that Eli."

05:47:02 You say, "Ather, just go strand his ass somwhere."

05:47:06 You say, "Sorry."

05:47:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Since when did you start caring about upholding League law?"

05:47:19 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:47:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes Ather get this shithead out of here for awhile."

05:47:23 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:47:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm pretty sure theft is against the law in any alliance."

05:47:52 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:47:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So is aligning yourself with pirates."

05:48:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If theft was committed to take those parts, they were not stolen from the AEU. Therefore, no crime was committed against the AEU. Which means that you're only pursuing something like this out of pure spite."

05:48:32 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:48:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Precisely."

05:48:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I persued it because I think my theory holds weight regardless of alliance."

05:49:00 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

05:49:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Whoah."

05:49:12 Lily Kaise says, "Man he is just um."

05:49:17 You say, "Wow."

05:49:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I think there is something there and I think all of you on that trip are trying to hide something."

05:50:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Eli Grey transmits, "Arlight, You've both said your piece, now that's enough."

05:50:05 You say, "I'm not one for strading pilots, but he's annoying me enough that it's temptingme."

05:50:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Which would make you a lot more like the slavers than I."

05:50:10 You say, "Stranding."

05:50:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay I'm done Eli, hes not worth my time."

05:50:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, it wouldn't make me like the slavers. I actually helped arrange the means to help a group of people survived. They traded them into situations where they would've most likely died."

05:51:24 Lily says to you, "Yeah and if you need help, bring me and i'll let Magellan have a party on him."

05:52:17 You grin at Lily Kaise.

05:52:19 Lily Kaise says, "In fact, I think we should call him out and take him somewhere."

05:52:45 Lily Kaise says, "I bet nobody would pick him up either."

05:52:48 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:52:53 You say, "Oh, Eve might."

05:52:58 Lily Kaise asks, "Who?"

05:53:04 You say, "She that much against stranding. Evenia."

05:53:31 Lily Kaise says, "Well we oculd let her know that we had business to take care of. I am too but we have to manage our own sometimes."

05:53:40 You nod.

05:54:14 Lily Kaise says, "Where's that pancakes place? I should know because heh I was stranded there one time and I need to fetch a ship I put over ther too and sell that thing."

05:54:19 Lily Kaise laughs.

05:54:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Eli Grey transmits, "The League has been informed of it, it's being handled by them, as it should be. Now,  no more about this on this channel. If you two want to go duke it out in a field somewhere that's your peroggative, but I don't want to hear anymore about this on public channels."

05:58:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "As long as Vernos stops trying his "oh my gosh I accidentally sent that letter" and actually owns up to his idiocy I'm generally good."

05:59:10 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:00:31 You say to Lily, "The most important thing to me is that you are happy and comfortable and enjoy our intimacy."

06:03:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The more you all act this way about it, the more I grow even more confident that I am onto something. We will get along fine, just stay out of my way and if I am wrong at the end of everything then I will eat the crow and bite the bullet."

06:04:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Tell your little Aisling that too please."

06:06:40 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

06:07:21 Lily says to you, "I so do. I just wish I could manage more time for it and I promise you I will work on that Love. I so want to please you and especially in a manner that you enjoy."

06:08:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh and I'll add this before I quit since Eli asked nicely. If my theory had no weight at all, you guys would just go about your business and not be all ruffled as if trying to hide it."

06:09:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs.

06:09:26 Lily Kaise says, "Heh who has anything to hide but Vernos. I am still very concerned and baffled over that incident in 777 yesterday."

06:09:49 You say, "Me too."

06:10:31 You kiss Lily Kaise.

06:10:55 You say to Lily, "But please, don't feel obligated to. That's not what I want."

06:13:36 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:14:04 Lily says to you, "You should know me better than that! I'm not one who accepts obligations unless I take ownership of them."

06:14:09 Lily Kaise grins at you.

06:14:12 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:31:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "But this truly is enough to make me wanna go upstairs in Old Frontier and toss back a few of those sweet drinks and I don't drink a lot of hard stuff but yeah it's enough to want some sort of mind-numbing substance!"

06:31:42 Lily Kaise laughs.

06:31:47 You laugh.

06:31:54 You say to Lily, "I should get some sleep."

06:33:21 Lily says to you, "Rest well and sweet dreams."

06:34:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I think all that jazz would probably make my headache even worse. It's not bad sometimes, but yeah."

06:34:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Pilot's rest would be better. They have bunk beds."

06:35:21 You say to Lily, "Rest well and sweet dreams. I love you so so much."

06:36:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh well I enjoy it contrary to Ather. I do enjoy other music as well. I just wouldn't generally equate classical music in a lounge type setting but in a fine dining establishment true. Still, it's music and we don't get to enjoy very much music as pilots. Anyway good day Eli. Hope your headache improves."

06:36:13 Lily Kaise kisses you.

06:36:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, yeah I do like it most of the time. Just probably not at the moment."

08:39:33 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, so time may be running out on it sooner then? Damn that sucks. Well, I can't imagine why they wouldn't renew it."

08:39:42 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I remember seeing somewhere in very old news that people couldn't use the skims for a while or something, we're just going back to what we had before then I think."

08:40:06 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I don't believe I've heard anything bad between the Fringe and the Mutuality."

08:40:20 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It said it was renewed, that's the point, read the headline again."

08:40:33 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "More importantly the AEU wasn't mentioned."

08:40:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder if we'll lose the use of the skims."

08:40:58 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You might well lose everything."

08:42:02 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah,  I see it does say that, I read it wrong.."

08:42:14 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "What do you mean we may lose everything, ted?"

08:42:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Well, if you're not in Accord any more, what will your relationship end up being with any of us?"

08:43:10 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Really good acquaintances."

08:43:21 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What does Best want, what will other governments agree to?"

08:43:25 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Mutuality isn't in the Accord either and that doesn't seem to to be an issue."

08:43:29 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "With an incredible variety of women's underwear for sale on our home planets."

08:43:31 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've heard."

08:43:36 [General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.

08:44:15 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "And before anybody says anything, I am in favour of relations between us all being as close as they can be."

08:44:23 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Outccord isn't just bad for the AEU, it's bad for everybody. If the AEU pulls it's funding, who do you think is going to have to pick up the slack."

08:44:57 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Agreed, question is, what can be done to stop it?"

08:46:17 [General Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So far, not much it seems. But we'll see."

08:48:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Indeed, I think serious consideration needs to be given to the impact of any potential decisions that Best might make, hoe they impact all of us potentially, and what the responses should be, and I'm sure that must be happening at government level."

08:48:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Constatine, are you busy? I'd like to have a brief word with you if you can."

08:49:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Of course."

08:49:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hmm, I'm out at 777 but I was going to head in soon. How long will you be around?"

08:57:14 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "For AEU, all of this is simply one's act, one's profit. Drink deep of your poisonous bounty, and rest your weary eyes."

08:57:33 [General Communication] Ted Warburton chortles.

08:57:40 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There you have it."

08:57:46 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's, diplomatic."

08:58:04 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "You all got exactly what you wished."

08:58:45 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Ah, I wouldn't go that far, I haven't said what I actually wish for, in full, I've only hinted, and that's how I'll leave it for now."

08:59:01 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "You are not AEU."

08:59:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You did say all."

08:59:52 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I am not unhappy about this latest headline though, from my own perspective, it's very welcome."

09:00:38 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Ted, she is talking about me. I sent a letter about a theory I had and Best decided to twist it use it to say I had said the Mutuality cooperates with pirates."

09:00:52 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh, that's how that came about."

09:01:01 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "This is broader than that."

09:01:14 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "If you are so narrow, you do not deserve to work in a field so broad."

09:01:42 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Well just so you know Anfisa, he did twist my words outside of that no clue what you speak of."

09:02:57 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "!ow:don't be sa'ing anything juicy whi$e I'm sk<mming."

09:03:05 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "Certainly. Of course. You have no idea. You kick your foot with other foot in innocence. Tch."

09:03:37 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "You are only upset that you got caught attempting to sow discord."

09:03:42 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "That is all."

09:05:04 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Basically, Best is Worst, or something like that."

09:05:27 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No I got caugh persuing a theory that I am still sure in. Time will tell and if I am wrong I will eat crow and be humble in my incorrectness."

09:06:39 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "You are attempting to sow discord."

09:07:25 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "If you do not acknowledge this truth, you are simply lying about intent."

09:08:36 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I have a question!"

09:08:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm done with her, I explained my side."

09:08:58 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Is it a REAL theory? Or are you just putting out a hypothesis that you don't actually have any supporting evidence for?"

09:09:56 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "A theory is a theory because you are searching for the evidence that supports it. It becomes fact when you have that evidence."

09:10:26 [General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I have never called my theory anything close to fact."

09:10:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think maybe tensions are running high."

09:11:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Don't pay her any mind."

09:11:01 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I'm pretty sure that's not actually a theory!"

09:11:20 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Asteris yelled at me a lot about that word."

09:11:21 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz sighs.

09:11:54 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Who's Asteris?"

09:12:17 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "It is true. Is simply searching for ways to manipulate data into proving you right."

09:12:39 [General Communication] Xenolinguist Keegan Wantz transmits, "My fellow pseudo-Xenolinguist who retired a long time ago after doing some crazy shit."

09:13:18 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Long story short, never let a rift entity partially subsume you."

09:13:32 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Even if it's Euclid."

09:13:47 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh."

09:15:41 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "What did I just miss in that skim?"

09:15:46 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "You could have caused some serious damage with faulty science."

09:15:52 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nothing good."

09:17:48 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I thought I heard Keegan say something about subsuming."

09:18:17 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh y$ah, that was good."

09:18:22 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "A guy got subsumed by Euclid."

09:18:28 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, partially."

09:18:55 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I'm sure it was still wholly unpleasant."

09:19:11 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh, he wasn't talking about trying to get rid of Worst then."

09:21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, I gue%s&Eli went to bed."

09:24:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "In reality I think he wanted to talk to you about me speaking to you on my theory."

09:24:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Who knows."

09:26:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "O;$%I d<n't know."

09:27:46 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Which is the bad part."

09:28:00 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Don't Get Subsumed By Rift Entities."

09:28:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Personally I think only the guilty get so defensive but they do have a right to be mad about the part that Best twisted."

09:28:57 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "The last rift entity I saw hated everything, fortunately it didn't do anything hostile, it just hated whatever we were talking about."

09:29:51 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "'&didn't e.>n know t#ere were entities out =here."

09:30:02 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "Yes, of course."

09:30:11 [General Communication] Anfisa the Wanderer, Combat Diplomat transmits, "The Rift Drive would not exist without one."

09:30:16 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hopef.lly I don't get subsu+e]."

09:31:06 [General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Maybe we need to get worst in the rift somehow, poor rift."

09:31:17 [General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe he is a rift entity."

09:37:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh.. I'm sorry Constatine, I ran into a problem. I didn't mean to ignore you if you ever responded."

09:37:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Did you ever respond?"

09:37:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I did, and no worries, I'm headed back to home space and I'll be around in about 5 or so minutes."

09:37:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Meet you at your office?"

09:38:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, I hope you weren't soming back just because I asked to meet you for a moment. It can wait, or I can just call you or something if you have a phone."

09:38:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, I wanted to head in anyway."

09:38:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I do need to get around to buying a phone."

09:39:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or a plan, I guess. I have a phone, but it's just decorative."

09:41:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you can afford all the stuff you want on it, it's extra nice, because you can get rid of some of the other excess stuff you have."

09:41:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh can you you get news and the message board on them?"

09:41:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I was glad to not have to wear a news reader, message board, temp tation reference ETc anymore."

09:42:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's kinda expensive though, my plan is like 65 million a month or something like that."

09:42:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, when I tried to sign up a long time ago I remember thinking it was a lot."

09:42:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, I'm pulling in, but I'm going to stop by the cantina before I head up."
