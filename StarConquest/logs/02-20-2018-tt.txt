-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with
a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and
filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of
lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and
amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a pair of
tan suede clogs here.
You can go out.

Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! A new Salvage Processor has just
been deployed East of Steel Phoenix Command. This utilizes the Ultimate Salvage
Processor which will yield better results. Early tomorrow morning, a new BAS
will be deployed utilizing the Advanced Multi-function Battle Scanner. For
Beacon drops. The BAS will be located just West of Steel Phoenix Command. Thanks
to Starseekers help with these along with SEAS. Tomorrow a more advanced
Xenology Scanner which utilizes the Quantum Xenology Scanner will be deployed
East of Steel Phoenix Command. To access these stations, simply Jump to Steel
phoenix Command and move to the eastern edge of the sector. Then, enter the next
Sector East for the Salvage Processor and the Xenology Scanner. To access the
BAS, simply move to the Western edge of the steel phoenix Command Sector and to
the next Sector West. Please utilize these stations as we may not continue to
sponsor them if in a month or two we determine that no AEU pilots are utilizing
these Stations. [18:01 19 February 2318 GST]

Subject: NOUVEAU QUEBEC GREATEST FAT MARDI OF 2318
Author: Pierre-Louis Tremblay-du-Lys
Posted: 23:52 19 February 2318 GST
--
Allo to all pilotes and other people able to read this!
It is once again time for glorious Mardi Gras of the Fat Mardi at Nouveau
Quebec! Some might say it is rather soon after Newest Year super party, but it
is important to maintain dominance as bestest party station of space.
Now, glorious celebration will start on the Saturday of the 24th febuary at
2369, or 2359 if you subscribe to inferior units of time.
You want to come? Very exciting! Perhaps you could take space bus at Foxtrot
Station around The Arm? It has fair chance of arriving on time and it even has
toilet now. You could always use own ship, or go with somenone else. There might
even be accelerators around the area to get there faster.
Either way, just bring your boobies and credits: we shall supply the beads. It
is a BYOB, if you will.
Not interested in sexiness of party? Why, I had secret dispatch from the
Ministre Des Cartes Stellaires that a starchart might or might not be available
for the buying!  It might or might not be limited time offer, so be sure to take
pause from mining and gathering mold to visit.
Call me if you new more of the information, I am in the directory.

[Starship "Starfish"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.
