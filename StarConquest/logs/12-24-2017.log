04:44 Lily Kaise just entered the ship.

04:44 You kiss Lily Kaise.

04:44 Lily Kaise says to you, "Did you also deny it?"

04:44 You nod.

04:44 You say, "I did."

04:44 Lily Kaise says, "Oh interesting that we all had to to clear it."

04:44 Lily Kaise sits down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:44 You say, "But you already denied it before I got a chance."

04:44 Lily Kaise says, "Oh oops."

04:44 You say, "Heh."

04:44 You say, "It's ok."

04:44 Lily Kaise says, "Oh I thought we all had to."

04:44 You say, "Nope, just one of us."

04:44 You're already sitting.

04:45 Lily Kaise says, "Oh well at least it was done."

04:45 You nod.

04:45 Lily Kaise says, "It was to Morris haha."

04:45 Lily Kaise laughs.

04:45 Lily Kaise grasps a large lever on the control board and pushes it slowly away from her.

04:45 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

04:45 Lily Kaise uses the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

04:45 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "William Dove, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

04:45 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

04:45 You say, "Yeah, I saw that."

04:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

04:45 Lily Kaise says, "Heh you're generally much quicker to respond than me."

04:45 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the FTL flight control board.

04:45 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

04:45 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

04:45 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

04:45 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

04:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

04:45 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

04:45 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."

04:46 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

04:46 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, William Dove! Welcome to The Torus!"

04:46 Lily Kaise presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

04:46 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

04:46 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

04:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

04:46 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

04:47 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, William Dove. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

04:47 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

04:47 You say to Lily, "Let's go lie down when we land?"

04:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

04:47 The computer informs you that you have mail waiting, which may be picked up at New Earth; Spaceport Mail Room.

04:47 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

04:47 Lily Kaise pulls a large lever towards her.

04:47 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

04:47 Lily Kaise says, "Ok Love."

04:47 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

04:47 You smile at Lily Kaise.

Merry Annual Festive Holiday-Related Gift-Transferring Celebratory Event!

This year, like last year, we hosts are busy in all sorts of ways! However, we're going to try to make things go a little smoother this time so we can make sure everyone gets a gift!

First of all, please make your holiday wish at Icy's station at any time within the next few days. We will aim for having a proper Icy visitation and celebration a little closer to the holiday!

Please try to make your holiday wishes modest ones. We would appreciate wishes for things which are relatively easy to make, like variations on things that already exist in some form. Examples: clothing, jewelry, felo games, action figures, temporary tattoos, actual tattoos, custom hair styles, small "plastic surgery" type tweaks, custom communicators, dispensers with a sensibly modest selection, or perhaps you'd just like a nice cactus. Please have all the details for your holiday wish prepared. If you think your first wish might be too much, please include a more modest second choice. Use the WISH command repeatedly to add additional lines of text!

Thank you!
