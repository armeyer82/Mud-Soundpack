Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Kalina!
Welcome to The Torus!"
The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship,
Kalina. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully

[Starship "Tornado"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Starship "Kalina"; Docking Bay.

He'll either cut corners and we'll end up with shitty warships. Or He'll do as
promised and we'll end up with a whole fleet of powerful warships that will
still be useless if the Outsiders come and we have to face them alone."

impression that the outsiders, if they really cared to, could destroy us all

holding them back,  is simple ignorance on certain issues."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's the

ship that can really withstand a shot from it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay, I've
read about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, a
dreadful weapon that can destroy world's. This was the main point I addressed on
the broadcast."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This is also
why it's ridiculous that Best is claiming Grenwold was never a planet that got
destroyed. The destruction of Grenwold was what allowed the aliens to find the
location of resistance headquarters, resulting in the death of Benjamin
Masterson mere moments later."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's a well
documented part of human history."

keep a copy?"

copies of important letters you send. Unless you want there to be no proof
later."

really want, Vernos, but I would suggest against it. I think you're remembering
it in a too forgiving light. It's not a good look for you."

to request a copy if possible from the AEU to go along with the one you
produce."

mind bringing your EAOS? I don't want to get us all blown up, so I'd prefer to
have an AEU repairing."

heavly inspect our mail as we send it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The AEU does that?"
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I thought somebody else was
gonna take an AEU. RATS would replace EAOS, not AEU."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, okay."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whichever you like then.
I'll bring my AEU."

[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Hey, news flash! No wait, it
would be wasted breath to try to explain this to you."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there still a spot in
the camp?"
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Sure."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "What do you want Cheri. I
worded a letter extremely badly. Made it sound like the mutuality actively works
with pirates and that I was threatening the League....I did it, I have to live
with it and accept it. Outside of that I am trying to work on moving forward and
working on actions instead of jjust throwing words around."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Were you coming Constantine?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm also not expecting instant
grafication or forgiveness."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I'm almost there,
sorry."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "No worries. Just wasn't sure if
you were coming in the first place."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "Stop throwing words around."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "The solution was already given to
you."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I will say thank you to Nissi
for providing the copy."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Yeah, turns out I wasn't
lying after all, huh. Who'd have guessed?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Never said you were."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Now this will be the
only joke I ever make regarding the matter."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "And this folks is
why Ather writes the letters and not me."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Just heavily implied."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "You should be investigated."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay what would you like me
investigated for, writing a terribly worded letter?"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There's a difference between
badly worded and heavily veiled threats."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No threat was intended."
[General Communication] Aisling transmits, "Actively conspiring to tamper with
Mutuality and League relations."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "It was pretty clearly a
threat. How ya didn't mean it as such is beyond me."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You were already given a means by
which you can fix things, take it or leave it."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "For sanity's sake. I
am so tired of all this. I could scream. Vernos. Just do whatever it is they
have asked of you to fix things. And accept that people are going to be mad for
a good long time. And you won't be forgiven in a hurry. I am not trying to be
harsh here. But there are way. Bigger things that the AEU needs to be worried
about than this. Like the accord situation. I have said my piece. And I am now
staying out of this."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So Vernos, what do you think
of pilots aiding unregs?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "As I admitted to morris, if my
family was in trouble I would have gone to help them myself."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Ah, your family are unregs?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No but if they were I would
help them."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "If they were, you'd not be an AEU
pilot.."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Your words are meaningless."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Only meaningless if you sit
there and nitpick at everyone one of them."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I questioned them in the context
of a complete sentence that you came up with."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "So how do you feel about AEU
pilots aiding unregs?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "No you tried to invalidate my
words."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm done with you. Straight
answers are not forthcoming. Hide the truth behind diversion all you like."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Cheri, the law is a stupid law
but is a law if that makes sense."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "How do you feel about it?"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I don't agree with the law but
it exists. I cant say its not a law or be unreasonably expected not to ahere to
it."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "That being said."
[General Communication] Cheri Lindbergh transmits, "I didn't ask about the law,
I asked how you feel about the act of aiding unregs."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Unregistered people
are human, and human lives are important. The act in itself in AEU space is
illegal but in that being said. I personally agree with aiding unregs since they
are in fact humanity."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Unregistered people are human,
and human lives are important. The act in itself in AEU space is illegal but in
that being said. I personally agree with aiding unregs since they are in fact
humanity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Miscomm but yeah."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Thank you for your honesty."
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Full statement to come
regarding the Accord and AEU departure forthcoming."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Vernos, I get
what you're trying to do, but I really don't think you should be talking about
this stuff in public."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Constantine maybe
not but whats done is done."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Right but you
could quit while you're ahead. We were just talking about information we want
from the liaison office."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How are we going
to get it if you get canned?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Wait what?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Sorry I juuuust came back into work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "We are in a pickle."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Evangeline."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hm."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Evangeline,
you going to be around for a bit?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Yes. What do you need?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Just wante
dto send you something in the mail. If you're busy you can check it later, it's
not important."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "I'm not busy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Hahah, a bobble head. Thanks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "No prob."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can take him
with you next time you take the fight to the outsiders!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Nice, he's good luck!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Awww Thank you Eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, don't
mention it. Looks like the lovely lady is getting all the gifts today."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
"Yeah I even got letters from hakeem."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's not the
best situation, but on the off chance that something does happen to Vernos, we
can still right Lambeth firectly. Still better to have a Voice, but just to ease
folks concerns, we won't be completely screwed."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Directly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "True."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nissi I will be writing
something to you, I'd like to deliver it to you personally and leave without
incident please."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "To all the civilian
pilot liaisons out there.. You stamp those reports, you stamp em real good."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I picked a good time not to
stand, didn't I."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident
transmits, "Eli, shoot me your number, or call me. I'm on the directory."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Okay. I guess."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I switch hands just to keep
muscular balance."
[General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Stamp stamp stamp."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Joel, you just said you don't
do politics though."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's a good call
Joel. You don't want one regular arm and one freakishly huge stamping arm."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Oh, wait, maybe it's the
banging, er, I mean, stamping, you like."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Oh no I
think it's the constant stemulation he likes."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh my."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I don't. Stamping reports is a
far cry from politics. I'm a bureaucrat."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton chortles.
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I'm just in the Manhattan
lounge. Nobody's looking to do anything to you. Nobody here anyway."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Actually, Whip and GSL are
good fun."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "GSL sure is."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I don't get anyone telling me
not to blow up."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle snickers.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I love whip, and
really enjoyed voice. Joel...no comments from the peanut gallery."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Alko's a good enough GSL, but
I fancy getting my hands on it again at some point."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Hey constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Knock on power after
you deliver that?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's so much
easier not to stare over the phone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli whistles innocently
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.

[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes. I
spoke with him today."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "...
No."

to be the only one left in communications range."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I will be here too.

office."

[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Who wants to put up the
beacon chain next week?"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Count those hands."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "I don't have a key to
the ship. Or headings. But I'd do it. If I can get a hand."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Glad to know
saying things like that doesn't make you uncomfortable Evangeline."
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I would help someone else
do it."
[General Communication] Evangeline breathes into the communicator.
[General Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'd be happy to help you."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "270 1."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
"Oh no."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "You'll never hear me
say no to building stations, I adore it."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Eve, get someone to go
along with you. I'll set the first station up because it's the weirdest."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "You go
Mel."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I might be able to help."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If people need to put it up
a day early, that's fine too. It'll take a bit to get done."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "What
does that beacon go to again?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sure thing Mel. Just
send me a key. And maybe a letter. Since I haven't done the chain myself before.
And it'll get done."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "When do you all take off?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Seriously, somebody
better bring me back a T-shirt or something. I've also recently learned that
they have a fine selection of toothbrushes."

eyelashes, I want eyelashes."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "False

goddess."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Awww."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Sanity no. Just no no

allow you to get black, then."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hot pink Eve. It's...different

[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident giggles. "Oooh."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Seriously, if someone
could get me some...I'd pay you back. I've always wanted them."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Don't
think they cost that much."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "You'll probably end up with 10
sets now."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I don't
think. I'm not sure."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Well if they do...I

you'll pay Tael for?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach laughs.
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Would
you like a toothbrush? Perhaps some cushions to sit on?"
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oo yes, yes I would."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I want some pillows."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I think we need space for a

sure."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "How would you like to maintain
the Bubble stations while I'm gone?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "My constructor is not
fully upgraded though. Shouldn't be a problem to do so if anyone needs me to."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "I'll give you a key to my mod
transport too. You'll have options."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Sure, I can probably
handle that. When does the next one go down, do you know?"

[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Eli. I can lend a
hand if you like. And Joel doesn't have an issue. I've built those before."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I can probalby handle
it, the Constructor makes things a breeze, but I'll still probably take you up
on it. It's been a while since I've maintained any stations."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "If you are gonna use a
constructor, you're gonna need to move parts. It's probably best to do it before
tomorrow so you'll have everything you need."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Do I need to give you a
key to mine? Or can I just do what I've seen others do and launch the mod
transport and jettison them, then salvage them up?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Ah, alright Mel."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Just in case you are
missing something, we can be able to sort it."

parts go on which stations."

goddess, No."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Better than the latest news."
[General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Don't do that. When people get
back then you'd need like 16 pilots for approval."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident snorts. "Oh don't
even go there."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'd prefer the news, thanks.
There will also be a transmitter at 270."
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Right. Beacons?"
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "I can in a few minutes, but
i"m not sure how many a few is at this point."

short crew, starboard side only."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Damn,
that sucks."
[General Communication] Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I would
beacon, but I have found I'm hella lazy."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Wut?"

[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "A few was a lot less than I
expected, if you got more I'm int."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "He said, right, beacons, so I
said he'd have to short crew, starboard only."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "So all that volunteered was
me and general apathy?"
[Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Yup. Not enough interest it
seems."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "I am busy, cannot do
beacons."
[General Communication] Joel Kringle transmits, "Same."
[Tactical Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "Ok then I'm back to going and
dying in my own special way."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I am going to bed."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Oh shit, here she
goes."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels laughs.

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Mel, can you buy me uh...10
high power accelerators, 10 weather tops, 10 battlecruiser class inserters,
uh...a bucnh of xeno lab scanners uh..."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Sure."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now I just gotta figure out
where I'm gonna put 'em all."

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Space Market.
You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a
bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I haven't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay. They're
not too bad, one or two torpedoes should do the trick. Do you have an ammunition
box in your fighter full of torpedoes?"

scout! It's great for that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are a
couple things that make exploration much easier though, the most important being
an autovector unit."

get that at 300 industry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That's a long ways to
go. Whats it do?"

have to move to the edge of a sector, switch to manual control, move across the
boundary, switch back, etc."

patrol always needs people to salvage bari corpses."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's a really
good source of points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "All the
activities we can do as pilots give you some kind of balance between money and
points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Salvaging gives
you the most points."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you're going
to salvage, always transfer your salvage at the processor in The Belt of Orion."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Why there?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I've been coming to
new earth to transfer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There are some
stations out in space that are maintained by pilots. You typically get more
money for transferring to them, due to tax breaks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "You can also do
ground work for industry points on Teslaworld."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It doesn't give
as many as salvaging, but if you're getting tired of salvaging it can be a nice
change of pace."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hauling
asteroids is another activity that still gives a decent amount of points, though
it's more skewed towards money."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Lots of options. Its
hard to pick."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but it's a
good thing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Try to try a
bunch of different things, you might find something you really like."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The space vermin
salving missions are probably the easiest points for now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Got six cores saved
up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Salvaging,
sorry."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice! Those are
worth points too."

Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If you ever find
yourself poking around the bookstore, there's this one book, Moose's Big Book of
Industry, that explains a lot about everything we can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I already have a copy
of that book!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "It's been a big help."

that a lot."

pretty new myself."

where exactly."

the active writers currently."

the The Calm, but I don't love it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Took two book
cases."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, wow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "I am thinking of
upgrading some of the salvaging gear on my hauler."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It's a good idea
to keep that stuff upgraded."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "In my opinion,
the most important piece is the scanner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Being able to
see more chunks at once is huge, especially when you're looking for specific
things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Like in the SVPC
missions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Other than that,
strength is good to have on your grapple."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The stronger the
grapple, the faster chunks break apart."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Well, my ships should
be a bit more comfortable now..without falling down."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's always
good."

coming to meet me? I want to pick your brain about defense strategy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "What kind of ice
cream?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Strawberry!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There's a truck
that goes around here."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "That is.. acceptable.
But bubblegum is the best."

a grade zero comet."

You're on comms at the same time a fair amount."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "We usually find one of us
wakes up and the other is about to sleep."
[General Communication] "Yeah." Evenia an Eachtrannach chuckles. "That's
honestly usually how it is. Or we're around at the same time for like...maybe 2
hours."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Well, it's an option
sometimes."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I just go when I can.
Sometimes I got two hours, sometimes more."

that either one of us is doing something else, or the timing is bad."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "That's how it is. Even for
folks with blue."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's easier at some times of
day than others too, and I tend to be around at the quiet time, in fact, lately,
it's been so quiet that I've woken up and gone straight back to sleep again.
Even Ali and I don't match on timings any more."
[General Communication] Evenia an Eachtrannach transmits, "Night. Pilots.
Critters. Robots. And half-robot ace pilots."

[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Rogue and I want to go too,
but we've not matched on timings either."

money to GMG with you. That'll fix the timing issues."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Dead serious."
[General Communication] Caleb Davenport transmits, "Hey wait money?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Now the question comes of how
much."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Nobody else pays for GMG."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Sure they do."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I pay half the toll every time
I do."

just about right."

[General Communication] Morris Corlew laughs at Erik Goodwin.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Fuck that."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton laughs.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "This is why I bought most of
Jacob's bench when he was selling too though, certainly helped me for a good
while."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Question. Does anyone know if
there's any difference in functioning between an arachnoid security bot and a
normal humanoid security bot?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I think the stun is stronger
on the arachnoid...and the humanoid I think can't craft or caretake or
anything."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Oh...wow shame."

I can be awake for the setting off. Night everyone."

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the

What do you do and why?
2. Consider the above question again, but now assume that the overwhelming
hostile force is threatening a civilian location. What do you do and why?
3. Would you rather be short one gunner or short an engineer? Why?
4. Your ship has one failsafe left and enemy reinforcements will be arriving
soon. What actions do you take?
5. You are part of a large combat force attacking an Outsider patrol. You easily
overwhelm them, but before you can take out the stragglers, a Magistrate-class
regional mothership appears. What do you and your allies do and why?
6. In the event of a large-scale invasion of human space by hostile forces, what
would be your priority and why?
7. In an emergency, you and your ship are placed at the disposal of a naval wing
commander. How do you feel you would handle this situation?
8. What are your starship combat experiences that do not include Accord-issues
missions, organised decoy beacons, or simulators?
9. What would you say is your greatest weakness as a combat pilot?
10. How long do you expect this ship to remain undamaged?
11. How would you predict this ship will be destroyed?
12. What do you plan to name this ship, should you acquire one?

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole
drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.

You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

The ship is already moving.

The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant
572" has jumped out of the sector.
What was once a feature of interstellar geography is now the name of an
alliance, and the heart of Fringe space can be found past this gateway. The tiny
station of Nuevo Laredo stands guard here.
The planet of Chetumal floats before you here, the richest planet among the
Fringe Worlds, although that isn't saying a lot.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to Chetumal in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order
is entered."
Via general sector communication, Chetumal transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm!
Welcome to Chetumal Orbit!"

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a long row of cinder blocks, and a trash
can here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and down.
Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

Subject: Temporary Absence - Going to Feng wo and Various
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 16:37 26 July 2317 GST
--
Hello Everyone,
I am leaving for Feng Wo this evening at around 20:00. for perhaps
a week or more.
Therefore, this will be a good opportunity for you to get some
practice in Temporary Space Station Building. I will be describing
stations which are maintained in the next Messages so please work
with the organizations indicated or as specified, if you are
unable to find their parts as designated. If you aren't available
to build a station such as the Asteroid Processor in Alpha 285, at
least just after it goes offline, please reach out for help but
not at the last hour or it will likely cause a considerable delay.
LIBS is a good organization to reach out to or Starseekers for the
Asteroid Processor in Alpha 285. As for the Artifact Alpha 777
project, then reach out and coordinate with LIBS as you see that
there is a day or two remainig on the life span of a related
Temporary Space Station. Please check the Range Office at least
every other day and be certain to check for those Temporary Space
Stations which are within 24 hours of their life span.
To contribute or obtain Modules from SEAS, if Johann or Evenia
requests a Module from SEAS, then meet them on Accord at the Module
Requisition shop and purchase the Module and have it loaded aboard
whichever Module Transporter is specified. SEAS has Member
Megacredits specified for this purpose.

Subject: Temporary Space Station Building Tips
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 16:41 26 July 2317 GST
--
Hello Everyone,
,
Regarding Temporary Space Station building, please take the time to
go over to Accord and then up to the next level ramp from Doc 4.
If you go to the left and then straight ahead, you will see the
Modules Requisition shop. Please learn about the categories -
Core, Power Plant, Top and Side Modules. I know that this will
initially appear to be a bit complex. However, over time, you will
become more familiar with the various Temporary Space Station
Modules and their respective functionality.
Special notes --
If you do not possess keys to starships indicated in the breakdown
of a Temporary Space Station, then ask shule or myself to provide
you with or to loan you a key. If you are assigned to maintain a
given Temporary Space Station or stations, then you won't have to
return keys.
Now for tips on Temporary Space Station Building --
- you will find Modules scattered about on different Module
Transporters. This is because it isn't convenient for
organizations to report to Accord per each instance that a Module
or Modules are required. Therefore, we try to maintain extra
Modules for our respective contributions. for SEAS, I am currently
storing them aboard my own Module Transporter, 'Building Capital'
and will be purchasing SEAS own Module Transporter if not at this
posting or at sometime in the future.
- Transferring Modules to other Starships such as to 'Herding
cats' - simply board the Module Transporter where the desired
Module is and proceed to the Bay. Attach a lifter to the module
desired or Lifters to Modules. Then proceed up to the control
Room, power up, launch and then press the 'BAY' button which will
open the Module bay Door. Next be certain to wear a full spacesuit
and proceed to the Module Bay. Next push each Lifter out which
has an attached Module. Go out of the Module Bay and detach each
lifter and push each empty Lifter out to the bay door. Finally,
reenter the Module bay, go up and into the Control Room. Press
the 'BAY' button to close the Bay door and land on Doc 4. Repeat
this process by going to all desired Module Transporters to obtain
desired Modules. After you have pushed all of the necessary
Modules out into the sector that are required to build a Temporary
Space Station, then enter 'Herding Cats', launch and salvage the
modules from the sector. Be certain to check the Module Bay to
verify that you have obtained all of the desired modules you need.
- Building a Temporary Space Station - This is a bit tedious
particulary if there are a number of other Modules already stored
on the Constructor 'Herding Cats'. I try to discourage others from
putting too many Cores, Tops and things on there but it's likely
not going to happen. These extra modules will likely be eventually
moved out though to facilitate easier assembly.
- now, consult the list of Module for a given Temporary Space
Station. Go to the Bay and pull one each, a hose and a power cord
from their respective reels.
Note where the Core is that you want to attach to. Unless a
Temporary Space Station is already built in the Constructor, the
last core should be the last Core out of all available Cores. Be
very careful that the Core is for the correct organization.
Next, note the other Modules you will need to construct a given
Temporary Space Station. Although there is no particular order in
which to connect up their air and power, it's good practice to
observe order for completeness. You might want to start with the
power plant, then Side Modules and then the Top but random
attaching is prone to cause one to miss necessary Modules.
To attach a Module, attach one end of a hose to the desired Module
and then the other end to the desired Core. Repeat this process
with the Power Cord. Next, pull one each a Hose and a Power Cord
from their respective reels and repeat this process until all
desired Modules are attached to the desired Core.
- Temporary Space Station Construction --
go back to the Control room. Power up, Launch and press the 'BAY'
button to open the Bay door. Return to the Module Bay with your
spacesuit on and COMBINE each Module except the Core to be included
in the desired Temporary Space Station.
Finally, once all desired Modules but Core are assembled, then
Combine the Core which will produce a fully assembled Temporary
Space Station.
The last step is to travel to the point of deployment. open the
Bay Door and enter the Module Bay fully spacesuited. Press the
'USE' lever on the core of the desired Temporary Space Station and
wait for its deployment. If the Temporary Space Station has an AEU
core, you will hear an announcement over the AEU Sector Status
Channel. Otherwise, a message will be received via the
organization's notification service that it has contributed to the
specified Temporary Space Station.
If you need any clarifications, please ask anyone in SEAS who has
experience with Temporary Space Station Building.

"Preferably so as not to waste resources but if you can't be available, it's ok
to do so a few hours ahead of time just always try to meet that approximate
time. It's just the scooping station that is more finicky because you cannot put
up another scoop until the current one expires."

Outsiders."

Minor Change:
Whether people are jostled in crowded control rooms now has more to do with who
has actually recently been near the controls, though larger groups of people
will continue to be an inconvenience regardless, depending on the size of the
ship. Also, more commands will potentially result in jostling.
This means that, for example, a fighter cockpit becomes crowded very easily.
However, a handful of people in the control room of a large ship will not cause
issues unless multiple people are actually reaching for the controls around the
same time.
[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Wait."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not yet."

possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thin, hooked white claws

A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new
post in AEU/Common Knowledge.
[MTTS] Ulias: Heh, he already did Lunarfang, several times I believe.
[MTTS] lunarfang: Oh god. I need to play catchup then. Absolutely incredible!
[MTTS] Ulias: Are thre things in our pilot contracts that preventing us from
aligning with any particular politcal party?
[MTTS] lunarfang: And what's the best version of cofefe?
[MTTS] me: Oh god I nearly died.
[MTTS] me: There should so be a vergion.
[MTTS] me: Version, holy god.
[MTTS] Ulias: Way to make me almost spit RC out of my nose.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Eli."
[MTTS] Butchulla: Thank you. I just laughed so hard I spat coffee everywhere.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah?"
[MTTS] lunarfang: Oh god hey no spitting cofefe now.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "How was grenwold?"
[MTTS] Squidmind: There is nothing in the pilot contract that prevents a pilot
from supporting a political party, though giving donations would come under the
regulations relating to credits being transfered to the general economy and thus
wouldn't be particularly feasable.
[MTTS] Ulias: Ah cool. And yeah, that makes sense about the credits.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Were any of the
asteroids, bari free?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's still
exploded."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And there's
no bari on those chunks, not that I know of anyways. The ones that were there
before were there because pilots put them there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You know you
can just go land on them yourself right?"
[MTTS] atherj: Not possible to just put a cap on those donations, for the
interested parties?
[MTTS] atherj: I seem to recall something similar introduced a while back where
a person can't give a cadet more than a set amount of credits. I don't know if
that's still the case.
[MTTS] Ulias: I definitely see one in thre my character would want to be a part
of, though it's one of the small weaker ones.
[MTTS] Squidmind: It's a combination of the regulations about how pilot economy
interacts with general economy and the laws relating to how donations can be
given to political parties, which has its own foibles.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Give me a quick hand
on the one rock there?"
[MTTS] atherj: Gocha.
[MTTS] Squidmind: So a civilian pilot might be able to give the heady sum of
10,000 credits... but that seems somewhat unhelpful from the pilot's
perspective.
[MTTS] Ulias: Oh, that's still nice to know though. So a donation can be made
just not a normal civilian pilot amount of insane credits like we toss around.
[MTTS] Ulias: More liketran 1 give you a hand?
[MTTS] Ulias: Ignore that please.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Give you
ahand?"
[MTTS] atherj: I am curious about one thing, though. You have cruisers, which
cost about a half a bllion credits for example, right? But supposedly, that's
not actually the full cost; only 5% of it. Does that mean that the cruiser
really costs like 10 billion credits in actuality and the aliance funds that?
[MTTS] Ulias: It's more like 500 billion a week.
[MTTS] Squidmind: The exact figures are ill-defined but basically yes, atherj. 
Starships are ridiculously expensive.
[MTTS] atherj: Gocha.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I have been
searching a bit more into that item you had me looking for since you said that

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Need to make
