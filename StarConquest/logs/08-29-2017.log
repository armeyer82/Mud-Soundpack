A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

02:05:29 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:05:30 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.

03:16:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Who? Rogue Robot Ace pilot Ather Jammoa? He's a stand-up guy."

03:16:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Okay, glad that you understand then. I'm used to people picking at it's meaning on the general comms."

04:21:42 Dear Mr. Elemmire,

Recently, you applied to Telex Defense Incorporated's Special Orders Department seeking permission to purchase and operate a T6-09 Telex Defense Inc. Pincer-Class Forward Assault Frigate. Your application was analyzed by our finest psychologists, and we also reviewed all records of your service as a pilot.

Unfortunately, at the conclusion of this process, we reached the decision that we could not accept your application at this time.

You are welcome to re-apply at the beginning of the next six week civilian liaison term. If you choose to do so, we will take your new application responses into account along with any new additions to your pilot record that have occurred in the intervening time.

Until then, please accept our condolences and find enclosed one coupon for a free small Rickety Rick's Spacey Cheesey Fries.

Sincerely,
Telex Defense Incorporated's Special Orders Department

05:38:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, he knows about the ship for sure. He was talking to me about it earlier."

05:39:10 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I wont lie that im curious about what kind of ship it is."

05:39:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "He didn't claim it, because he was pretty mad at what they were implying."

05:39:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I would be too."

05:39:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's apparently a fighter called,  of course, the Patriot."

05:40:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That's.. kind of amusing. I'd be even more amused if it was only for those deigned to be patriots."

05:42:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Apparently they are pushing Lambeth out, I have no idea who his replacement is supposed to be yet."

05:43:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They are shifting the blame for tensions with the Mutuality for Lambeth and the QSA thing. They claim the flotilla has nothing to do with it."

06:01:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hm, okay, actually I was thinking that we three patriots should be the ones to retrieve the proposal results."

06:01:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys can witness it."

06:01:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just so that they don't suspect tampering."

06:01:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "By 'unpatriotic' elements."

06:01:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If you guys are amenable to that idea."

06:01:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I'm cool with that."

06:01:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Tough I'd like to do it later today."

06:01:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though."

06:02:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone coughs.

06:02:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, great."

06:02:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It needs to be up for 24 hours anyways, I think."

06:02:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "You might want to check the terminal for tampering though."

06:02:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."

06:02:35 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Since if there was headline about things on your terminal.."

06:02:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, there's no tampering there. I'm afraid they just used some statements I made to serve their own ends, in this case."

06:02:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Though which ones, I'm not entirely sure."

06:02:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're very good at that."

06:02:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't think I've ever discussed unregs on the terminal."

06:03:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd be glad to be there if I'm available."

06:03:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well you discussed Mutuality and they're unregs."

06:03:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They're a recognized alliance, but they're also still considered unregs."

06:04:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, but I didn't really connect them to Lambeth."

06:04:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess I did say the meeting he presided over didn't provide any satisfactory results."

06:04:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And the meeting was about unregs."

06:04:33 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So I guess in a sense."

06:04:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Dots could be connected."

06:04:47 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That wasn't his fault either though."

06:04:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I know."

06:05:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh I meant our meeting discussing it with him, not the actual meeting."

06:05:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I believe it, I once saw the news twist someone praising the navy into them saying we could do without them."

06:06:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They said somethin glike "We could not have done it without the navy, and the news just took out certain words so that it said "We could do without the navy""

06:06:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

06:06:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "They'll take what they want to get their message out, I guess."

06:09:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess there's probably no harm in checking out that fighter, since it's already in the news anyways."

06:09:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You're call though, bud."

06:09:39 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I'll take a look at it in a bit."

06:43:05 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.

06:46:58 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He's a pretty nice guy."

06:47:19 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "If he is kind to unregistered people I would assume so."

06:47:23 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "So who was it?"

06:47:31 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Our former liaison."

06:48:15 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I suppose it was only a matter of time for him based on what I was told."

06:48:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:50:13 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders in from the north.

06:51:03 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Congrats constantine."

06:51:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey laughs.

06:51:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The news headline I mean."

06:51:31 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "We're all Patriots, now."

06:51:42 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You talking about Bailey?"

06:51:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Nah, I'm just bests Main according to him."

06:52:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks Vernos."

06:52:24 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "No, like the government Liaison."

06:52:28 [General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Andrew Lambeth."

06:52:40 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Huh, nice guy."

06:53:08 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Well, just proof that if you are friendly to unregistered people in the AEU, you get punished."

06:53:13 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "As if there was any questions."

06:53:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'd love to see it some time or did you blow it up to spit in his face?"

06:53:25 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "He was also quite responsive during the slave trading business, so he's obviously a decent guy."

06:53:38 [General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Be proud, glorious patriots of the AEU. Be proud."

06:53:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't blown it up, I haven't looked at it yet either."

06:53:43 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Which goes to show what sort of people his opposition is."

06:53:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll find you next time I see you on comms and you can have a look."

06:54:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Alright."

06:54:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Be sure to put a plaque on it, displaying how you truly feel for Best and then continue to turn away merchants and picket in it. Or just blow it up. Or do whatever."

06:55:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'll give you one credit for it's debris after you blow it up."

06:55:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Emily."

06:55:58 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yes, that would be me."

06:56:05 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Really? Fancy that."

06:56:14 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I know, it's hard to believe."

06:56:17 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Emily!"

06:56:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.

06:56:23 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Who's that?"

06:56:41 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Something you may have had a nightmare about once."

06:56:56 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Oh it's you."

06:56:59 [General Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Somebody once taught me, an appropriate response for this is "No, really?"."

06:57:04 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Or twice, or a bunch of times. Really, I feel bad for you. All those horrible dreams with me in them."

06:57:11 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Where on earth have you been hiding?"

06:57:30 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Holy shit you're alive."

06:57:38 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I was going to ask you kindly. If you could put a BAS on joyride for me. I thought there might be one on cats spare parts. But alas. No stupid rush. But the BAS goes down in like a day or so."

06:57:42 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Sounds like a person who disappears for months at a time and leaves ships full of felo to die, stinking up the old Earth garage in the process."

06:57:57 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I oh hell. Oh, just oh hell. Well, I've pretty much convinced myself that I may never have another creature again except maybe fish, maybe, because I've been traumatized by them dying one too many times."

06:58:13 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

06:58:14 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

06:58:50 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Are we supposed to be buying all these modules? Mel said she'd fixed up most of the stuff."

06:59:27 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "She might have just totally forgot to get the bas. I guarantee you she'll be fine with it. Cats always provides the...well, BAS for the bas. But I don't see one anywhere."

06:59:51 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "So I wound up leaving because I convinced myself that I was too irresponsible to be good for anything, went in to this really horrible self destructive spiral that I'll spare you the details of, wound up in counseling because I went to turn in my license and I think I put somethign really embarrassing as the reason why, and... though I'm not necessarily convinced I'm all right, I've been convinced to try living again. And living, for me, had involved flying for years."

06:59:52 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "No worries, I'll be heading over that way in a little while and will put one on there."

07:00:01 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "As in, cats and vassals."

07:01:16 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Hurrah, Madame Song the Swift or some such."

07:01:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

07:02:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "So constantine, how goes having best twist your every word?"

07:02:50 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "The erratic? Unpredictable? Erm..."

07:04:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly out.

07:07:46 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Nicolette believe me. I've beat myself up about everything for over a year. I tried to walk off a cliff at some point over New Year's. I'm pretty sure someone who does that as a reaction to their own irresponsibility knows how bad they are, or can be. Though I'm not asking for any sympathy over that believe me, it was pretty ridiculous, now I'm just trying to figure out where I fit and what I can be trusted to do again and hopefully, something good will come of it."

07:08:45 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Though, I'm in no position to do anything like that again, thankfully."

07:09:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm...Ur, not quite sure of the history here. But I'm going to guess you starved a bunch of beautiful animals to death?"

07:09:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I also don't know you. Just, going on the current topic of conversation."

07:10:08 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Let's be honest, half of everyone's forgotten to feed felo at some point."

07:10:35 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Forgetting to feed felo doesn't include just walking away from them for months."

07:10:47 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "On multiple occasions."

07:11:15 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Knowing full well what would happen to them."

07:11:59 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Totally forgetting and then fixing the situation as soon as you can is one thing Keegan, but...walking away from them? that's starvation, last I checked."

07:12:07 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Sounds like you're holding onto some bitterness, which is just fine, but she's been gone for awhile and immediately jumping on shit that happened probably close to a year ago at this point doesn't help anyone."

07:12:37 [General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "She's been gone for a while, and the felo that died due to it are still dead. Sounds to me like they're still holding on to it too."

07:12:48 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm not jumping on anyone for the record. I'm simply trying to understand."

07:12:57 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Sounds like a missed opportunity for some lovely Felo Meat Hamburgers."

07:12:58 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "A tragedy."

07:13:13 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "You're terrible, Keegan."

07:13:21 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Keegan, that's fucked up."

07:13:30 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I say as I pet my psychic felo."

07:13:45 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Don't worry Scherzo, I do not intend to cook you. You have a name."

07:13:50 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:14:43 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There's the BAS module aboard."

07:14:59 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Thanks Emily. I promise if Mel didn't intend us to have a BAS and I turn out being wrong about the module, I will offer myself up for the slaughter."

07:15:27 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Great, I'll sharpen the knives in preparation."

07:15:33 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:15:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'm sure she just forgot though, so it'll be fine."

07:15:59 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It also gives me an excuse to sign up for my salvage missions while I'm here, it's not bad motivation really."

07:16:22 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Mmm. Salvage."

07:16:45 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Quick. Cover your ears Keegan. Turn down the communicator. We said salvage."

07:17:09 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Only two loads a day, any more is just decadence."

07:17:18 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Ceylan."

07:17:21 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "You monsters."

07:17:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Says the guy who just talked about making felo meat hamburgers."

07:17:41 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah laughs.

07:17:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Are we allowing merchants again?"

07:18:01 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "That don't sound appetizin'."

07:19:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "The beacons are still up, and the merchants don't have to listen to what we say. It was never a matter of allowing them or not."

07:19:52 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Spider meat pies?"

07:19:54 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Spiders weave webs of intrigue."

07:21:20 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "He's clearly doing it for effect, and it worked."

07:21:30 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yup."

07:21:30 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yes, hi."

07:21:43 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Emily's got the right idea."

07:21:45 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz chuckles.

07:21:56 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Oh no doubt. But if one of us didn't let him think it was working, he wouldn't stop."

07:22:03 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I have become predictable in my old age."

07:22:07 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz sighs.

07:22:18 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "That's okay Keegan, we still love you."

07:22:21 [General Communication] Emily Ford coughs.

07:22:36 [General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I'll help scrape the rust from your hair sometime."

07:22:57 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I use the word love in the most generic and loosest possible way."

07:23:04 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz chortles.

07:23:38 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "So much so that it's hard to tell if it had any real meaning or significance in that sentence at all."

07:23:52 [General Communication] Emily Ford giggles.

07:24:31 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I like this job as communications clerk, I get to sit on my rear end with a slice of toast and a cup of tea, waiting for messages to finish coming in."

07:24:49 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "So far, hi ra."

07:25:01 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Rayne."

07:25:15 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "They're saying hi to Rayne. I guess I can leave now."

07:25:22 [General Communication] Sean Sloan transmits, "What sort of tea do you like?"

07:25:58 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I drink the good old British stuff from the lounge, though this tea from the Accord galley is pretty good. It's strong enough that you just know it's tea."

07:26:14 Shine the big white glowing felo bats at a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker.

07:26:24 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Unintentionally. I had things set up so they'd be fed while I was gone for a week or so. I don't know what happened while I was gone, either I miscalculated what would be needed, or I gave a robot commands that inadvertently canceled its task, or the people I asked didn't have keys I thought I'd gave them. The latter I could have asked about, but when I started finding them dead I don't... something just emotionally broke, I left the spaceport and wlaked blindly in the same direction until I couldn't anymore. And after that, the rest is just too embarrassing to recount. Though I've been though enough tests for people to be sure I'm not going to do something crazy reckless and endanger me and others indirectly because of emotional residue."

07:27:13 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There's a message coming in for you Rayne."

07:27:33 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I ah... not to sound melodramatic or anything but didn't figure anyone would want to say hi to me."

07:27:50 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "My guess is, Mel's sending it."

07:27:54 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I don't know you. But hi."

07:28:00 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I love Mel."

07:28:33 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Oh, and I like the orange spiced tea from the coffee shop."

07:28:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, sorry, I was dozing a bit."

07:28:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would say on balance."

07:28:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Having him twist my words is..."

07:29:05 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Fairly to moderately bad."

07:29:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I do feel bad for Mr. Lambeth."

07:30:17 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I don't think I know you either, but hi to you too."

07:30:37 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I'm Rogue."

07:30:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But, what I try to remember is that they're going to do what they want regardless, and just find whatever justification they can wherever they can find it."

07:30:54 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I'm the notorious and much hated but also loved by some so it's confusing Rayne."

07:30:56 [General Communication] Rayne Song chuckles.

07:31:35 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Oh okay, hello Rayne. Pretty name."

07:31:59 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Thanks."

07:32:25 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Emily, I would bring you tea but first I'd have to know where you are."

07:33:45 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'm in the entanglement chamber on Accord."

07:34:15 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

07:37:27 [General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "I don't like starving felo either, but don't take em too serious Rayne. There's actually two people guilty of mass felo starvation in that conversation, but it's just one of em we're supposed to forget about apparently."

07:38:52 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "I don't think I could take care of another creature for a while, I'd be so anxious the whole time. I think I'm reacting more to being reminded of that anxiety than the thing doing the reminding, honestly."

07:38:55 [General Communication] A robotic voice says, "Incoming QE message from Ceylan to AFW Command: HI RAYNE FRM MM <END>"

07:39:13 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Awww, Mel."

07:42:00 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Stare in to my... OK, as wary as I am, I'm curious."

07:42:15 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's a trap."

07:42:57 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Did you want a message sending back?"

07:43:17 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Sure, but I'm not sure what to say in it."

07:43:28 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Have a think, there's no rush."

07:45:25 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "It's not a trap."

07:45:39 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Unless you don't want a felo to stare into your soul."

07:45:41 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "All traps are outlined as not being such."

07:45:53 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Save your soul."

07:46:09 [General Communication] Creator of Disunity Rayne Song transmits, "Maybe if a felo stares in to my soul, he'll decide whether to eat it or let me be and then I'll know."

07:46:42 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Woo, five hundred industry now."

07:47:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Nice."

07:48:04 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Anyway, that aside, I am curious, where are you?"

07:49:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Aw I forgot about the bari vent cleaning."

07:49:48 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, hmm, I guess that would be covered by the strike."

07:49:55 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I haven't even thought about it because mining is anyway."

07:51:00 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'd argue it's defense of home space against the bari."

07:51:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it does seem cruel and unusual to let the station sit like that."

07:51:33 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Chetumal."

07:51:38 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "No guarantee that he'll do it though."

07:51:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You may be able to put a crew together. I probably did three or four with no other AEU help when everyone was gone on expeditions."

07:51:57 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 386,537.65 credits from a xenology submission.

07:53:08 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I would do it, but breaking the strike rules now is what I don't need."

07:53:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Its fine."

07:53:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "I just wanted to buy that silver liscence for mining sites."

08:09:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh hey, it's rayne song! I think I like know her or something."

08:09:16 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Possibly."

08:09:20 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Probably from a bad dream. I feel for you."

08:09:30 [General Communication] Rayne Song chuckles.

08:09:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And Emily, I remember you! You were that mean girl scares me in the lounge."

08:11:32 [General Communication] Rayne Song transmits, "Wasnot originally a pig, does not count wait, who are you on about?"

08:11:41 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Woo."

08:11:47 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "I feel ignored."

08:22:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If ou can still here me, You can get hose licenses and still mine at Glittering belt."

08:23:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Can you? I thought those belts were explicitly for asteroid management."

08:23:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Or maybe driftingg cluster."

08:25:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You can definitely mine at the glittering belt."

08:25:41 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The management stuff is all done on a separate station."

08:25:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Doing it there would make it so the alliance gets the tax money, but the EAOS gets the metal, from my understanding."

08:26:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Drifting cluster that is, not glittering glittering is a Union mine that will recieve taxes and metals from it."

08:27:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "That's not explicitly true. The AEU will gain conquest progress from just about anything that a Civ Corps pilot does."

08:28:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I'll let you know if I see it come up in a report."

08:29:07 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You rferring to the comment about mining?"

08:29:25 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I also think I should mention that just because you don't get paid for something doesn't mean the AEU doesn't gain from it. Belt management, for example. You're paying out the money, but the conquest definitely benefits from it."

08:29:45 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Tara Flores transmits, "Yeah. Sorry. I sorta dozed for a bit."

08:30:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The conquest benefits from it when you turn in your points, not when you just pay your workers."

08:45:45 [General Communication] Rogue Romano sighs.

08:46:31 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Rayne must fallen asleep and left her gemini powered on chetumal's pad."

08:47:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hmm.. I remember you yelling over general comms about a rautine stealing something and then Evenia questioning if you were on haze."

15:00:44 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

15:00:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.

16:19:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Definitely something to avoid, yeah, especially in ships not meant for combat."

16:19:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

16:19:44 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "And yes, if you see ships like that, please say something over the alliance channel or the tactical channel."

16:35:59 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

16:36:04 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

16:36:04 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:36:22 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:36:22 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:36:23 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:36:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:36:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:36:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

16:36:28 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

16:36:33 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

16:36:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone chuckles.

16:36:51 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:36:52 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Not terrible, but was, and still am in need of a good holiday which is why you rarely see me."

16:36:56 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:36:57 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

16:36:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Starseekers must just be you and Evangeline now, Kim."

16:37:06 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:37:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

16:37:07 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.

17:06:38 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

17:10:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

17:22:55 You glance at your communicator's screen.

17:22:56 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, please join me in welcoming Jacob Shields to the corps. We look forward to working with you, Jacob. [15:06 29 August 2317 GST]

17:35:36 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Morning, AEU."

17:36:01 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Good afternoon."

17:36:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh wow. It is already the afternoon.."

17:38:38 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "It is, and, I do not believe we have spoken before. My name is Kim."

17:39:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "A pleasure. My name is Dakhal, although it seems most people call me Dak."

17:40:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Pleased to get to know you, Dakhal."

18:08:26 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Welcome to the corps Jacob!"

18:08:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Afternoon, Eli."

18:08:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And welcoem back Kim! Welcoem back to the madhouse!"

18:08:50 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Thank you kindly."

18:09:27 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oooh. You a Telexan man Jacob?"

18:10:25 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

18:10:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "What exactly do you mean by that?"

18:11:51 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, I didn't mean anything bad. The way you said kindly after you said thank you just reminded me of the way some of the folks on the planet Telex talk."

18:12:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Hyperion Rules."

18:12:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Ah, I understand. Well, as a matter of fact, since you put it that way, I was born there."

18:13:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, Hyperion does rule Dakhal. But when you've stayed up way too late drinking Hyperion ale, a good cup of Telexan coffee is a good way to shake the hangover."

18:14:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

18:14:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Day two of my binge shopping begins now."

18:15:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Hi Eli!who vernos."

18:15:17 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Uh, I just meant, hi Eli."

18:15:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Coffee is awesome. I need to get a mug soon."

18:15:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I think I may need coffee too."

18:15:54 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "But then again, I think making money is a bit more important at present. I still have that loan to pay off."

18:17:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I guess ou had a lot of headlines to catch up on,  eh Kim?"

18:17:52 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.

18:18:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I still do have quite a bit of catching up to do, yes."

18:20:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "Once I get my license I'll look at getting a little more stuff. That's gonna be fun."

18:21:02 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Oh yeah. Best part is getting out of that regulation shipsuit."

18:22:32 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, at the risk of sounding like a woman here, shopping actualy is quite fun."

18:23:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Actually, I enjoy it more now than I did before I was a pilot. Something about only being allowed in certain places gives shopping for things a sort of scavenger hunt type quality."

18:24:30 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm gonna find that damn mudslilde one of these days."

18:24:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er mudslide."

18:24:42 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Miscom."

18:24:58 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You heard nothing."

18:26:14 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Finally getting the hang of this scooping I think."

18:27:38 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Scooping is pretty fantastic."

18:28:09 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "When people talk of scooping, I get immensely sad."

18:28:30 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You can really get a sense for the speed when you are down in an atmosphere like that."

18:28:46 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "We'll get you a scoop soon Dakhal."

18:28:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "One of my favorite activities that I won't be able to do for likely a very long time."

18:28:57 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "It's not bad, just takes forever to fill up the hold. It's at least abreak from asteroid hauling."

18:29:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jacob Shields transmits, "I'm just over here salvaging."

18:29:19 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well if you've done it before, doesn't that mean you already have a scoop?"

18:29:51 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I probably batter this thing more than it needs to be, I go down as far as I can."

18:29:56 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It was on my old cargo hauler and it was a really ineffective scoop. It got sold when I turned the ship in."

18:30:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's what she said."

18:30:14 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne chuckles.

18:30:25 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "I just realized that before you said it."

18:31:24 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Considering the best Ican filter is 1.44% and my overall load is 1.39 percent so far..."

18:32:14 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Damn, that sucks Dakhal. Maybe once folks realize what poor choices Best has amde, they'll press for a proper delegation to be sent. Instead of leaving it up to us civilians."

18:32:57 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Not that we can't pull something like that off, but it's kinda hard when what they really want is assurance from our government, not us."

18:33:53 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Indeed. Mutuality is really pissed with the government though, so short of the AEU selling themselves completely short, which won't happen with Best in charge, I just don't see it happening."

18:34:22 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Also were you aware that the Hermes Star Liner has a docking bay?"

18:34:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Nah, that's just it, all the Mutuality really wants is an assurance that we won't attack. They shouldn't have to offer much to make it happen."

18:35:21 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "And no, I was not aware of that, how big is the bay?"

18:35:59 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Ash was just saying the other day what they wanted was something material. Of course, they want assurances that the AEU won't attack, but they want more than just that."

18:36:15 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "It's a 15 sizer. So it can fit a couple fighters."

18:36:37 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, but Ash was wrong about that from the first meeting as well."

18:37:20 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Could put three of those awesome Hyperion fighters in the liner."

18:37:28 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "She said they would want technology, and yet the council specifically told the delegation that they didn't want technology, they just want us not to attack them."

18:38:16 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The problem is that even with civilian pilots sayinng they won't attack, we don't speak for the whole government or the military, so they wouldn't accept those reassurances."

18:42:18 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Anyways, we'll figure it out soon enough."

18:42:39 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Eli, you ever find your coat yet?"

18:43:07 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles. "Yes, it was mysteriously returned to me."

18:43:48 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "The coat-thief must have had a change of heart."

18:45:03 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "Well, that's good."

18:46:08 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yes, thanks for asking. It's my special coat that fills the wearer with all the powers of a coat."

18:46:26 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "So warmth and comfort then. Got it."

18:46:34 [General Communication] Joel Kringle snickers.

18:46:44 [General Communication] Tobias Hawthorne transmits, "But eh, figured I'd ask, you sounded worried about it, and i've never seen a coat like that before."

18:47:07 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "It's a fine contrast to the blue."

18:47:18 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

18:47:18 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green leather captain's chair here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a dark green leather captain's chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

18:47:24 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Hello AEU."

18:47:27 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

18:47:27 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

18:47:30 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

18:47:35 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

18:47:35 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

18:47:39 There are no other ships in the sector.

18:47:42 The ship is already moving.

18:47:43 The ship is already moving.

18:47:45 The ship is already moving.

18:47:45 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

18:48:24 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:48:24 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

18:48:28 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

18:48:29 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:48:39 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:48:39 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:52:28 Via general sector communication, Luna transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to Lunar Orbit!"

18:52:38 AutoStar detects 2 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

18:52:38 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Luna.

18:52:41 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:52:43 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "If it doesn't have a docking bay, then the Hermes is mis-advertising."

18:52:45 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 248" has landed on the planet Luna.

18:53:04 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Industrial Whip Dakhal Araegin transmits, "When I checked their information, it stated it had a size 15 docking bay."

18:53:11 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:53:11 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

18:53:13 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "It probably is, because I just looked at Lily's and mine and neither of them have a dockingbay."

18:53:16 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

18:53:17 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

18:53:23 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's certainly possible, it is a light cruiser."

18:53:26 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

18:53:32 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

18:53:35 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:53:36 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:53:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah but how old are yours and Lily's? This could be a more recent addition."

18:54:06 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh wait."

18:54:13 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

18:54:13 You can go out and enter into the ship.

19:39:24 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:39:24 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
