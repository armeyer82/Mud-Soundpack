[Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a dark violet fabric armchair, a black plastic paper dispenser, a wormhole drive tracer, an overstuffed black sofa, an Accord long-range sensor technician, and a black plastic box labeled 'Photos' here.
Ather Jammoa is standing here.
You can go south and out.

00:49 You peer south...

[Starship "Vibrato Vivace"; Observation Deck]
This room leads to the living quarters, and contains some additional amenities, notably a tiny alcove containing a shower. A small keypad controls access to the living quarters. A standalone starmap viewer appears to be installed here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.

She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval, lightly-freckled, and lovely, with a button nose and dimpled chin. Her lips are faintly upturned and rose-pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and almond-shaped. Her ear-length, curly hair is auburn and in a chic and stylish pixie cut. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
A slender silver ring engraved with a row of tiny chainguns pierces her left earlobe and a slender silver ring engraved with a row of tiny chainguns pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a thin red knitted turtleneck, a wristwatch with a slim black leather band, a slim silver ID bracelet with C.T. engraved on the front in a flowing script, a pair of black low rise denim jeans, and a pair of supple black flight boots. She is also wearing an elegant gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a black silk handbag embroidered with brightly hued dragons, a silver touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, and a compact metallic purple camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a flower strap. Her head, face, both eyes, both hands, and waist are left uncovered.

00:59 Hawthorn gags slightly with each bite, but does just that.

01:00 Hawthorn Dunn takes a bite of a serving of hot chicken noodle soup in a white bowl.

01:00 The stage lights flicker briefly.

01:00 Hawthorn Dunn says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "I suggest tesla starting out with industry personally, until you can get a light transport. Then it's smoother sailing."

01:01 Hawthorn Dunn says, "Crap. That's what I was going to do. Get a scoop for my light transport."

01:01 Clarina Taylor takes a bite of a serving of hot spicy red beans and rice in a shallow bowl.

01:01 Hawthorn Dunn says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Salvage always was too slow for me. I can't do more than 2 loads a day."

01:05 Clarina Taylor sits down on an overstuffed aquamarine sofa.

01:05 Hawthorn says to Clarina Taylor, "So tell me what is was like in Candelaria?"

01:06 Clarina Taylor takes a bite of a serving of hot ramen with vegetables in a small bowl, quickly slurping up the longer noodles.

01:06 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:06 Clarina Taylor presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:06 Blake Madison's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Where we headed from here?"

01:06 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Second."

01:06 Clarina Taylor switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.

01:06 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:07 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:07 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

01:07 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Message board says 213 69."

01:07 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:08 [Tactical Communication] Hank Marvelstine transmits, "Ok cat when your ready we're at chetumal."

01:08 I don't understand that.

01:10 Hawthorn Dunn presses a button, calling up the coordinate rundown, and studies it for a moment.

01:10 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

01:10 Clarina Taylor says into the PA microphone, "Aye 213 69 and he wanted to recharge there."

01:10 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

01:10 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

01:10 The computer beeps in an imperative manner and informs you that the starship's sensors have detected a new location of interest in the riftflow.

01:10 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

01:10 Ather Jammoa's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Oh, fine."

01:10 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

02:32 Lily Kaise says into the PA microphone, "Time to turn off the Morris show."

02:33 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out from its perch on Lily Kaise's shoulder.

03:02 The shore is an expanse of ice, with many tormented bodies trapped within.

03:02 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

03:03 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

03:09 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

03:22 Lily Kaise says to you, "Guess we could go get some sleep Love?"

03:23 You smile at Lily Kaise.

03:28 The ship feels darker than usual, every light source subdued and seemingly unable to cast more than a dull glow on its surroundings. The dim light casts shadows on the myriad objects lining the ship, from black and white photographs of dour looking men and women to tiny jars and porcelain figures that seem strangely out of focus. The walls and floor are covered with elaborate geometric designs, and every surface appears to have an ornate piece of cloth draped over it. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

07:10 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

07:40 A conductor asks you for your ticket. You search your pockets, and when you finally look up to confess you've lost it, he is gone.

07:42 The train blows its whistle and steam billows as it slows.

07:52 The sound of the train echoes as it passes into a tunnel. A few moments later, it emerges again and all is back to normal.

08:10 Steam billows from the train's engine, obscuring your vision, turning the scene to formless mist.

08:11 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

09:11 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

09:15 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/Announcements.

09:33 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

10:00 The wind falls, the ocean growing noticeably flatter.

10:10 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

10:13 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

10:13 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

10:13 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

10:27 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

10:41 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Rift storms generally damage the drive more than normal travel, but they also have much higher flow when you are inside of one."

10:41 You hear a card being slapped down. A moment later, the ship takes an abrupt shortcut to another square.

10:41 The ship lands on a square marked, "Lose Next Turn."

10:41 Dice roll, and the ship is advanced around a corner of the board.

11:03 You hear cards being shuffled rapidly.

11:12 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:13 A strange-looking starship approaches from behind, being lifted and placed by a giant hand one square at a time. It advances a few spaces beyond your ship and stops.

11:15 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

11:18 The room grows a bit warmer.

11:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

11:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:57 Lily Kaise puts down a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

11:58 Lily Kaise lies back on a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

11:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

12:06 Goosebumps suddenly rise on your skin.

12:14 The room grows a bit warmer.

12:16 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

12:42 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

12:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

12:52 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

13:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:03 A bolt of lightning strikes a nearby blackened tree, setting it on fire.

13:11 The eruptions from the volcano become more sporadic, and the platform slows.

13:11 Agonized screams are heard within the ruptured earth as fire belches from the open orifices. The heat from the flames propel the platform into the air!

13:12 The fires from the chasms dissipate, and the platform levels off.

13:15 The fires from the chasms dissipate, and the platform levels off.

13:17 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:18 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

13:18 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

13:19 Demons menace the ship from the shore, and the oarsman increases his pace.

13:20 The oarsman relaxes briefly with a deep sigh.

14:19 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

14:20 The mist swirls as drops of water begin to fall from above. A moment later, the ceiling opens and a deluge of water pours into the room, filling it to the brim.

14:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

17:28 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "No worries, just clarifying for you so you'll know what you might expect to find in the future for new discovereies."

17:29 The humming of the engines intensifies as the starship glides faster through the water.

17:37 You hear a hiss of steam venting from the engine as the pressure builds.

18:10 The ship surfaces abruptly with a spray of water that transforms into swirling mist.

18:10 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

18:12 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

18:24 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

18:39 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

18:49 A lush forest comes into view, and the chunk of land dips down, just above the canopy, before lifting back up into the sky.

19:11 A tailwind catches the floating island, pushing it forward at increasing speeds.

19:12 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision.

19:12 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

19:13 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Night Gonzales!"

19:13 Clarina Taylor's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sleep well."

19:13 With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.

19:14 Simon Collins's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Beware of puke green fish."

19:16 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Gross!"

19:17 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We don't really need someone in the control room unless we're doing approaches, for the record."

19:42 A metallic scratching sound echoes through the hull as it catches on something hidden inside the endless webbing.

19:52 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Coming back, Clari?"

19:52 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

20:03 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

20:13 A single tendril of silk wafts over you, glistening with beads of moisture.

20:13 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

20:13 A door appears in the mist and flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

20:43 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

20:54 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

21:04 You step into another room and notice a door left open to the dark night. Vaguely unsettled, you hurry to close it.

21:14 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

21:16 With a sudden feeling of impending doom, you turn around. The scene abruptly fades to formless mist.

21:16 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

21:24 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Bit of a headache, so just hanging out in the control room."

21:40 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

21:46 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/Announcements.

21:50 A section of web outside the ship snaps and flails in the air before sticking to a viewport.

22:10 A cluster of eyes suddenly opens inside the webbing. They stare hungrily through the window before disappearing.

22:18 The intricate webbing gradually loses cohesion, eventually falling apart into quickly evaporating smoke and shifting mists.

22:18 Listen. You need to be careful.

22:23 Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Well we're out of known space at least."

22:24 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Yep, more valuable stuff out here, still local though."

22:24 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "We probably won't hit unknown space."

22:24 Keegan Wantz's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "That's mostly outside the NDB range."

22:25 It's not always about where you're going.

22:25 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

22:26 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Vibrato Vivace/General.

22:26 It's the journey, not the destination, that matters.

22:27 I don't understand that.
