Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Subject: Striking
Author: Constantine Stone
Posted: 17:40 23 September 2317 GST
--
Allies, the strike has been wearing on for over a month, and it seems (at least
to me) that it hasn't been very successful. Up until this point, most of us
haven't pressured newer pilots into striking, but lately I've been wondering if
all we're doing by not clamoring for 100% strike participation is postponing the
inevitable.
 
I've mentioned this a few times on comms, but all we're proving with less than
100% participation is that we have no bargaining power. We can gnash our teeth
and sit on our hands all we want, but the government knows that work will get
done no matter what. As it stands now, I don't think we're making any positive
progress.
 
What I want is for us to double down. Give me three straight conquests with not
a lick of work done, and we'll see what the government has to say about it and
go from there. Forget about what you have or haven't done up to this point;
let's all stand together across the line and show them that we mean business.
For those who are working, I understand that you became a pilot to work, but
even working a little bit might be dragging this whole mess out unnecessarily.
If you're getting bored, take to home space and turn transports around. I can
take you guys out and we can work on rift navigation, or I'm sure Shule (or I,
or several others) would be happy to fly practice dogfights in the simulator. I
know this situation sucks, but right now it sucks and we're not even in control.
Let's try to take control.
 
I notice that this conquest has already been tainted by work, but I think that's
okay -- it gives us an opportunity to have a dialogue about this, which is what
I want. What do you guys think? If you think we should consider another course
of action, or if you have any ideas about things we can do to keep ourselves
occupied, by all means post them here and we'll talk about them. I want to
stress that I don't mean to demand anything by this post, just to lay out a
suggestion. What I would like to see is us all agree to a plan by the end of the
conquest.

if Ather says no that's her excuse."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, Ather has
one very specific grievance. I think it might be possible to change his mind."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I just think
giving up on this is going to make all our lives much harder in the long run."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Nope he has always gone out of his way to belittle me. You see Ather is a very
jealous man and obviously very bitter about his current circumstances."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Heh see now you know org channels aren't
private."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
'yep
You return your metallic gold touch einrophone to the main screen.
'yep
You say, "Yep."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a
news application.
'Yeah, I figured.
You say, "Yeah, I figured."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident returns her metallic gold touch einrophone to the
main screen.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Damn."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know, I
think it could still be done. If you stopped setting up the scoop, and maybe
organized a protest or something, at an appropriate time, of course."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Then maybe sent
him a letter asking if he might lift his ban on us. I don't know, I think it
could work if you wanted to try."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I
don't htink it's up to me to organize protests I didn't start the strike."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But I get that
you might not want to do that."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "No, it
shouldn't be up to you, I agree. I don't think you did anything wrong by setting
up that station in 777, I'm just saying, I think this is a way we could get out
of this mess."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we
can reach our performance goals if we try!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Did
you even hear me Constantine? I already said I wouldn't put the next scoop up
for a week but I know it won't make any difference but hurt the org."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I heard
you."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "But as I said,
letting it go down for a week is not going to influence anyone. I would just
forget about it and put it up immediately in that case. I'm saying that if you
want to try to fix this, you should leave it down indefinitely. That's why I
brought it up again."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Constantine, destroying a few ships should negate the work that was already
done this conquest cycle. We should probably worry more about staging an
emergency protest or something though in light of the latest headline."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"That means forever and so I might as well disband the org."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with medium-length dangling tendrils
and an amethyst glowing interior pulsates gently.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I didn't
even see it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Okay, I'm ready
to protest when you are."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Yeah.
Looks like Rebane hated losing the election so much that now she basically wants
to get into Best's back pocket. I always knew she was a fraud, but this cements
it rather nicely."
They're just using you.
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, I'm not
saying you need to commit to leaving it down indefinitely. I'm just saying that
the outward appearance of us leaving it down during the strike will help your
case."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't pay
close attention to their stances on the Accord before I was a pilot, but a few
people led me to believe that while Rebane wanted to renegotiate a deal, she
didn't want to outright leave."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you think
she'd try to make a legitimate effort to come to an agreement?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Well,
according to that headline, it looks like she's changing her tune."

are correct Constantine and Rebane is more conservative but I'd concede to her
if she hasn't changed her view point to now support leaving Accord."

disappointing."

a new notice.

Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, I didn't see the recent headline

focus on protesting, instead. [18:21 23 September 2317 GST]

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
Tall yellowed grass surrounds you, dotted by sweetly scented, strange wild
flowers. The warm, alien plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, and the
planet's sun is beginning to set on the horizon. Two moons loom in the lavender
sky. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through
the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a black plastic
tray of spider chow, an insulated black cooler, Purr the humanoid service robot,
and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.

out what that corporation was, did we?"

was Best."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well... If it

Best's corporations, hell no."

it was a joke I believe as nobody has ever seen the Magnitor."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Nah, it's just
the description in the shop totally sounds like Best's rhetoric."

never get to fly a Magnetar now..."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
eli if we were privatized, we wouldn't also be able to perform our work as well
as our resources would be additionally limited there would be lots of budget
issues."

there's any reason to believe that."

hate the idea of privitization, which is fine, but we really don't know anything
about it."

holariously naive."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If we were
privatized.. I'd bet many pilots would leave and go to another alliance."

certainly would."

the company, I might."

about you? You relaly need to wake up and join the real galaxy."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
we don't have the option to go to another alliance but guess there is another
way to pilot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "What's the
difference, and why is it worth crying about?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not really."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "No,
but at least we don't work for a bunch of credit mongres. We work for our
alliance. There is a difference between working for our alliance, and working
for a bunch of idiots in a suit who don't give a shit about anything except your
levels of production."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Are we living in
the real galaxy right now? Because piloting life currently blows."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't see that
Best cares about our levels of production at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or anything we
do."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Best
is not the alliance."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I'm not sure
folks would migrate, but we'd probably see some folks retire."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But he does
control us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Ather. I am
pretty sure they care more about the profit margins then they would about the
pilots that fill those margins."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm pretty sure
this is already out reality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Our."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes
slowly.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right now,
they don't seem to care about either."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "The people we
work for certainly don't care about us individually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "He
doesn't control us. Otherwise he'd have stopped those of us who are on the
actual strike. He'd have imposed harsher punishments on those of us who have
blown up ships. If you work for a company, they will probably make you pay the
full cost of that ship if you blow it up. Good luck with that one!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep
they will care even less if we work for a private firm as well."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I guess we can
speculate, but I don't see how any one we work for could care less about us than
our current employers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's all I'm
saying."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident strokes a Tardick lizard named Asteria's warm
scaly skin.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "Fuck
that. I urge the rest of you not to share this mentality!"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Right now,
Best has to work within the rules. That's the biggest part of trying to get out
of the Accord, is so he'll have even less of them."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Ok
we'll probably go out of the tolerable of communications clarity before long so
see you later Constantine as we're just out exploring for awhile. No idea where
wer're going nor when we're coming back!"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, have a
good trip."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I'd
certainly love for them to show me that I'm wrong."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly south.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Probably more
than anyone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We
all would but we're expendable as when we're gone, they can recruit more."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "That's one
thing Ithink we all agree on about Best, no matter our reasons. He has to be
stopped before he takes all our freedoms away, one by one, until he has complete
control."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If not
stopped, then at least reigned in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Eli, if he tried
to take those freedoms away, there would be war."
A large semi-transparent spherical creature with long dangling tendrils and a

war war against whom?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Civil war."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It's gradual.
Like the Ministry of Facts deciding what knowledge we are allowed to know, or
putting pilots in battlesuits to fighten people into compliance."
Mischief the large black felo jumps into Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's lap and
settles in, purring.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
there would have been more going on i'd say if the average citizen cared
enough."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know,
people are dead. I think it's definitely heading that way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "It sounds
like civil war is already on the horizon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I concure with
eli."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And it might
spell the end of the Union."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "At least in its
current form."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"That's true and it will likely become a number of factions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Or, at least the
End of the Unions Civilian Pilots."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL
communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well
there already are but more defined."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Or get subsumed
by other alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well..
there's two star systems, so I'm not sure how many factions there would actually
be, but you could be right."

from the Liaison: There have been several patrols completed since their

activity in order to prevent future tragedies like the bombings and murders that
the people of Hyperion see on a daily basis. Would you not agree?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits,
"Battlesuits provide the intimidation factor. It's generally a sufficient
deterrent. Don't forget, we're still coming off of a war. The Outsiders haven't
even been pulled back for ten years."

The COMPLETE command is now an alias to talk to a mission-assigning NPC, if
there's one around. It'll still work the same with a normal mission assignment

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead
indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
fic-h8g9pXSZMe,Tms2(p$?/D+01\XO5zhwx18sa
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons

Category: Game Systems

Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added
ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance
government. These serve for one term lasting six weeks, and then the positions
are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same
basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance
government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the
alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view
information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in
progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress
toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This
person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the
civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular civilian pilot, you should
generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice.
But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as
Voice, you wish to communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write
a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are
other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded
mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed appropriately with your Voice or a
government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding
resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the
voting machine in your liaison office's conference room. All active pilots are
free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate
the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take
any action that it does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots
support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has
performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him
or her from office before the term has ended. Most properly, more than one pilot
should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an
appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be
communicated to the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the
government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will
be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against their Voice, if the
situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either
through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to
resign. Usually such a resignation will be accepted within a day or two, leaving
the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players
should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the
middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and
must be filled. The Voice should allow at least 24 hours to take nominations and
should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of
the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position
will be filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position;
an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone
else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from
other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations.
A Voice should communicate openly with his or her government and their own pilot
corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the
corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution
must occur to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government
approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to
sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be justified by good
roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often
want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless
their alliances have a lengthy history of good relations, the governments are
unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current
plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players are
seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot
corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each
other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There should be a good reason to
consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather
strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new
proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results
of a proposal. The date and time of any important meeting should be communicated
to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by
their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in
controversy.

Star Conquest Help: Rerolling
--
Category: Background
--
Rerolling is the process of deleting your character and creating a new one. The
term derives from tabletop roleplaying games, where a character's stats had to
be determined from dice rolls, and thus to "reroll" was to start over with your
character. In character in Star Conquest, this process is usually called
"retiring" your character.
There are many reasons that people choose to reroll. The best reason to reroll
is that you feel your current character's story has been told and you'd like to
try something new. If this is your reason, and your character has been
well-roleplayed and your account is in good standing, please use the SUPPORT
command to speak to a host about your thoughts for ending your current character
and transitioning to a new one. We can help you finish your character's story
and often even arrange for some of your character's progress (usually just
points) to be gradually transferred to the new character. If your character has
NOT usually been well-roleplayed, we are less likely to do these things. Please
read Policy 14: Minievents for more information.
You should not invent your own wild retirement stories, nor have your next
character or your out-of-game friends try to invent things about your old
character. In the past, we've had rerolled characters supposedly die in horrible
accidents, be drafted into the navy, become an advisor to the president, and
somehow turn into a giant Bari, all of which were incompatible with the game's
theme. If you want a story for the end of your character besides quiet
retirement, you MUST speak to a host.
We have stated the best reason to reroll. There are also many poor reasons to
reroll, which are unfortunately more common than good ones. Here are some that
we see regularly:
* You did something silly, such as attacking an alliance-mate, and you don't
care for the consequences.
* You are unhappy with your organization, but talking to people is hard and
rerolling is easy.
* You are unhappy with your boyfriend/girlfriend, but breaking up is frightening
and rerolling is easy.
* You did something wrong out-of-character, such as scripting combat, and got a
penalty.
There are two things that every good roleplayer learns to deal with:
consequences and interpersonal conflict. You cannot expect your character to be
happy all of the time. Sometimes, you will do things that your character will
just have to live with. Sometimes, you will have to have hard, even unpleasant
conversations with other characters. These things are all part of a character's
story, not a reason to end it. It's the human experience.
Remember that bad things tend to pass. In roleplaying games, memories are short.
If you did something bad, you can probably be turning over a new leaf by next
month. If you're in the midst of a bad breakup, you'll probably both have moved
on in two weeks. Think twice before destroying a long-term character over
short-term issues. It's always better to weave something new into your
character's tapestry than to rip the whole thing up and start over.
Playing through a bad situation makes both you and your character stronger.
Rerolling is simply a passive-aggressive easy out. We will always encourage
players to stick with their characters in situations like these.
If you are committed to rerolling, there is one more important "don't": this is
not the time to take parting shots at your former friends, your alliance, your
organization, etc., nor is it time to suddenly launch your finest warship with
guns blazing to see how much damage you can do. Doing these things with the
knowledge that your character won't last the hour is out-of-character and
essentially metagaming. If you are going to have it out with other characters,
make it part of the ongoing story. The alternative may be satisfying for you,
but it's frustrating for everyone else.
If you rerolled purely to avoid consequences or for other essentially
out-of-character reasons, your character may be given a "reroll" tag on the WHO
list to denote this.
The process to reroll your character is to log out of Star Conquest, log back
in, and choose the "Delete Character" option. Follow the prompts, then create a
new character at the main menu.
There are three reasons why a character has been deleted:
1) You have violated policy repeatedly or proven yourself unable to play the
game without being a detriment to other players or the game itself.
2) You have not played the game in over six months AND had less than 1000
aggregate points.
3) You deleted the character yourself manually, for a reason mentioned above.
With none of the above being true, your character WILL exist in some fashion.
If 1) is true, your character will not be restored under any circumstances. 
Depending on the situation your account may also have been banned, in which case
you will no longer be eligible to play the game.
If 2) is true, then creating a new character with your old account and opening a
SUPPORT ticket in order to speak to us is the correct course of action if you
wish for your character to be restored.  However, if your previous character had
not left cadethood or had less than 100 points, we strongly suggested that you
simply use the newer character.  You may still request a restoration, though we
will explain why it is not a good idea.  If you have been actively playing the
game with your new character prior to the restoration request then it will be
denied.
If 3) is true, there is a 48 hour 'Deleter's Remorse' grace period where you may
create a new character and open a SUPPORT ticket in order to have the deleted
character restored.  Beyond this point, we will NOT restore a manually deleted
character.  If you create a new character and actively play the game with the
new character, the grace period is rendered void. 
Be aware that the nature of the deletion will also play a part in whether the
character is restored - accidentally choosing 'Delete Character' and somehow
confirming twice is one thing.  Screaming over the comm that you hate everyone
and are going to go help the Outsiders exterminate humanity before deleting is
another.
To play a character different to your current one, you MUST delete your current
character.  Multiple accounts are against policy as stated in Policy 9, and
there is no need to create a new account if a CHARACTER has been deleted. 
Accounts do NOT get deleted.
Occasionally you may TEMPORARILY be unable to delete your character - this will
always be for a specific reason: You are in a liaison role, you are active in
the middle of an ongoing plotline, you are not in a location that makes sense
for a character to 'retire' from, or you have specifically requested that we
make you unable to delete your character.
What will be restored along with your character?
When a character is restored, all points they had at the point of deletion will
also be restored, as will any credits they had on them at that point.
However, items are usually unrecoverable and cannot be returned to you - the
character will most likely be naked and have no containers.  Any clothing,
books, workbenches, etc that they had are gone.  Any robots or other items will
likewise be gone, as will apartments.
Starships are not immediately purged upon their destruction or the deletion of a
character but ARE removed from the game world and are placed in a temporary
'limbo'. After a grace period any starship in this location will be deleted.  If
the restoration of the character occurs before the next starship recycling,
there is a POSSIBILITY that any ships previously owned by that player can be
restored.  If it is after the starship recycling period, the character's ships
will be gone forever.
This is why an idle-purged character that was relatively new will often not be
restored, as without ships or items it becomes very difficult for a 'new'
character to play the game.
