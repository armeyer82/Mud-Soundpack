00:09 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

00:16 [Newbie Help] Aya Navarro transmits, "Is there a quick way to check a ship's cargo hold?"

00:16 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Type cargo."

00:16 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Cargo or storage. Can be shortened to stor."

00:16 [Newbie Help] Aya Navarro transmits, "Thank you!"

00:20 A sudden light flares in the darkness behind the clouds.

00:25 The rainbow pathway sparkles as the clouds rush away, leaving behind shimmering blackness and finally regular space.

00:25 The mist turns to black smoke that soon drifts away, and you find that the ship is on a conveyor belt, moving rapidly through a factory.

00:28 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

00:29 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Hmm, how do I recover this disabled rats probe."

00:29 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Salvage it."

00:29 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Salvage it."

00:30 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Should it show up on my debris scanner when I type debris?"

00:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. That only shows chunks."

00:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It'll show on your rundown as other I believe."

00:30 [Newbie Help] Evenia Callseah transmits, "No. It'll be an other object, if I remember right."

00:35 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Try looking for an equal sign on the starmap."

00:35 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "And you probably have to go a sector or two outside the beacon sector."

00:35 [Newbie Help] Justin Fox transmits, "Figured that out today and recovered my first probe."

00:35 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, I finally figured that out too, I had to read the briefing again. It shows up as other object on rundown like they said too."

00:55 A gigantic hand suddenly picks up the ship, turns it from one side to the other, then places it back on the conveyor belt.

01:05 Steam billows and gears rattle loudly as the conveyor belt picks up speed.

01:13 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

01:15 Various ships of fantastical design are dropped onto the conveyor belt along with yours.

01:25 Your vision is obscured by a sudden burst of black smoke, which gradually fades to mist.

01:25 A door flies open in front of you, and you step through into a cramped, heavily decorated Victorian-era room. Something about this place isn't right.

01:26 You venture through a side door.

01:26 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

01:55 Something flashes past a window, too quickly to make out.

01:55 The feeling of dread suddenly abates, and your steps slow.

01:56 You venture through a side door.

01:56 You feel increasingly uneasy. You find yourself stepping more quickly.

01:56 You venture through a side door.

01:56 The starship has entered a unique area of space.

01:56 A large disc is suddenly before the ship, looking startingly like a single unfathomably large solid object. But the starship's sensors reveal that the mass is actually trillions of bits of matter of various sizes, all slowly orbiting a glowing ball of gas in the center of the disc. A solar system is being created here.
A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

01:56 Lily Kaise stands up from an insulated red sleeping bag.

01:56 Lily Kaise removes a small suitcase from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:09 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "This should be good enough."

02:10 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Nice debris."

02:10 The blast chamber shuts down, as the ship is moving.

02:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:10 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Meh."

02:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:11 The blast chamber begins warming up.

02:12 The blast chamber shuts down, having burned all of its fuel.

02:22 You hear a solid thunk sound as something is expelled from the storage room.

02:26 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure good choice!"

02:26 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker as she laughs.

02:29 Lily Kaise glides in from the west.

02:44 [Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Is there a help file that lists ship classes and crew required for each?"

02:44 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "No. Your alliance's ships book would help though."

02:44 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Sort of, that book chase is messing with is the leaue version of that."

02:44 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Check the bookstore on your capital planet or the space market."

02:44 [Newbie Help] Elaine Moreau transmits, "Thanks."

02:44 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Chase's wouldn't be the same alliance."

02:45 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Yeah, league version of that. I can't spell sorry."

02:45 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The League one wouldn't help her is what I'm saying."

03:10 The blast chamber shuts down, having burned all of its fuel.

03:10 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

03:11 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

03:11 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

03:11 The starship has left a unique area of space.

03:11 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

03:11 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

03:12 The endless noise of the carriage's wheels quiet slightly as it slows.

03:12 The road takes a turn, and the horses toss their heads as they follow it.

03:13 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

03:15 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Why won't this horrible peeople game work now? I'm sposed to type horrible aren't I?"

03:15 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "To start it, yes. But you have to be in a room that supports it."

03:15 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Oh."

03:15 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Lounges, basically."

03:15 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Understood."

03:23 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

03:41 A single bison studies your passing carriage from the side of the road.

03:51 A small stand of trees passes by on the left of the carriage.

04:01 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

04:05 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

04:13 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision.

04:13 The mist clears, and the ship is drifting along a placid black river, steered by a large haggard oarsman. It sails slowly through a gate inscribed with the words, "Lasciate ogne speranza, voi ch'intrate."

04:30 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How do you communicate over the radio on these atmo scoops? Com doesn't say anything when I type com message."

04:30 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Radio."

04:30 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "That says it's for my space suit radio, wear a complete space suit to use it."

04:31 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Hmm. I thought that was it. Try Channel."

04:32 [Newbie Help] Tamra Swenson transmits, "How do you use the radio."

04:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Try channel Tamra."

04:32 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Kert, when you typed radio, did you type a message too? Or just radio alone?"

04:32 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "I typed radio hi there."

04:33 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Tamra has said a couple of things to me."

04:33 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Did channel not work either?"

04:33 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Nope."

04:33 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "When I type com message it's completely silent no text on my end."

04:34 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How are you doing that I hear it but can't figure out how to say that I hear it, heh."

04:34 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's not a comm...Hmm. I thought it was radio. I guess not. Channel works for some things. Umm...if she's getting it to work...then Tamra, just tell him what you're doing here."

04:35 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Ok it's com it just doesn't echo back to the sender."

04:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It's possible it's like the squad communication and she's just talking."

04:35 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Oh ok."

04:36 [Newbie Help] "I feel like an idiot now." Morris Corlew laughs. "I looked at the help file and didn't see it. It just wasn't where I thought it was. But yeah, for future reference, it's in the list of commands in the help file, right above the part about scoop maintenance, and the command is comm."

04:37 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Crap. I didn't think to check the help file. I'm used to the help files not being that helpful here need in character books and such."

04:38 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "The help files are quite helpful. And a lot of times, things from the books are a combination of what's in the help files and personal experience of the writer."

04:43 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

04:52 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

05:02 The ship drifts through an area littered with flaming tombs, each with a soul screaming within.

05:06 [Starship "Concertoed Effort"; Living Quarters Three]

05:06 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, an insulated red sleeping bag, a small red insulated cooler, and a small purple trash bin here.
You can go out.
(You are lying on an insulated red sleeping bag.)

05:12 Disembodied souls drift back and forth overhead, buffeted by high winds.

05:14 The oarsman sighs and his pace relaxes.

05:14 The oarsman pushes at the water, steering the ship in a new direction.

05:14 The oarsman growls and increases the pace of the ship.

05:14 The river ends at the trapped, tormented form of Lucifer himself. A waterfall rains down toward his feet, and the ship plummets downward into swirling mist.

05:15 You mentally sigh in relief as you return to the starship.

05:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

05:25 The room grows a bit more chill.

05:27 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

05:30 Lily Kaise says, "Melinda just stopped to chart. Thought the drive broke but it hadn't."

05:35 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

05:35 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.

05:35 A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

05:36 A massive cloud billows through the ship, and when it passes, the ship has been replaced with a small island of grassy land, inexplicably soaring through the clouds. Far below, peaceful towns and farmlands checker the surface of the world.

05:37 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

05:41 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "How did chase do this description in the room about how he's laying on his back with a book on his chest? When I look in there it shows that."

05:41 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew 

05:42 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Err."

05:42 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, ""Pose.""

05:42 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Cool thanks."

05:42 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "You can type pose and the way you want it to look, or choose from a list by just typing pose by itself."

05:43 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Cool thanks, and go me I checked the help file this time too once I knew what I was lookingn for."

05:43 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Woo."

05:45 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Can't reference objects with the pose directly? Pose lying on ~couch with one arm over his eyes actually put ~couch."

05:46 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "Nope. Unfortunately you have to type it manually."

05:46 [Newbie Help] Kert On'Marr transmits, "Well, it's doable."

05:46 [Newbie Help] Morris Corlew transmits, "It is. Just a bit of extra work."

05:53 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

06:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:05 The grassy outcrop flies close to a snow-capped mountain range. Gentle flurries swirl around momentarily before the chunk veers away to warmer air.

06:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

06:16 A large, white bird with long, multicolored tail feathers soars over to one of the trees. It perches for a few moments before taking off into the sky.

06:26 The island seems to follow the snaking trail of a scenic river below.

06:35 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:36 The island ascends into a dense cloud, obscuring all vision. Just when you think it is about to emerge, the cloud dissipates and you are back in the starship.

06:36 You hear a steady, rhythmic sound. The mist clears, and you gaze out through the window at the passing landscape as the train chugs along.

06:47 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

06:56 The train is suddenly diverted onto another track.

09:06 Mist swirls through the air, coalescing into intricate silken webs that coat every surface.

09:06 With a sound like scraping stone, the ship changes direction.

09:06 The ship shudders and slows as the webs begin to catch on the hull.

09:07 The starship lurches as it falls through one part of the webbing into another.
