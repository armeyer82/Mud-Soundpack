-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two
narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
You can go out.

-lily  I love you.
You say to Lily, "I love you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was doing some estimates on what it will require sEAS to maintain what we currently have. It costs 7.3 billion per year to support a cruiser. so if we start to drift
below 10 billion, then I would ask you to start to contribute something towards the support of your cruiser. This would have been more critical if we were not added back to at least some of the
income-producing stations."

smile lily
You smile at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is why it's such a pain when people like Erik Goodwin is so short-sighted as to why an organization needs the benefit of participation if they want to help
others.. We can't convert credits to megacredits until we've achieved 2000 Command so when we start running low on Megacredits without any resources, then our Scoop would be our only source which would
still enable us to put up some stations independently. We'd only need to buy the main processor via the org and a core because the other modules can be bought by individuals. so we'd manage ok in spite of
things."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But he seems to have this attitude that it's all for just me and it's not."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have a list of individuals who I won't pay any attention to and currently they are Emily Ford, Erik Goodwin, Morris and a couple others."
grin
You grin.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'm surprised that Ali is letting him get away with tis though. I didn't think Ali had any issues with me or SEAS."
'Yeah, I didn't think so either.
You say, "Yeah, I didn't think so either."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I say though, I imagine that Erik will burnout on that particular project as it does requireeffort to trek out there to renew the stations. I sure wouldn't want
that job. However, if Melinda asked us to do it, we would."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have been considering a little excursion to GMG."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Since my carrier can accomodate a module scout plus 5 Geminis, we could invite Tara and Constantine so that we can get their colors for them plus 3 more geminis."
'well, we need to figure out how to get to the other side of the skim first.
You say, "Well, we need to figure out how to get to the other side of the skim first."

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on behalf of Space Explorers Amidst The Stars: Greetings Everyone! Here's an update on our Temporary Space Station participation. So far, we've been included on
both the Salvage processing station in Belt of Orion and in Artifact Alpha 777. Just Please note that Evenia has put Fringe Cores on those stations in Artifact Alpha 777. So you will only earn fringe
Credits when you transfer salvage on the Salvage Processor in Artifact alpha 777. You will also need Fringe Credits to pay for any necessary repairs which you obtain from the Watchtower in Artifact alpha
777. I haven't been able to determine the remaining power on the Asteroid processor in 285 but I am hopeful that once the current Asteroid processor goes offline, that we will be included in the next
build. The Deep Space Operations station in Belt of Orion, which is utilized for Salvage Operations, goes offline in about 15 hours as of this posting. That type of station isn't deployed on a continuous
basis but I would imagine that SEAS will be included on any future builds. The Xenology station in Belt of Orion still has about 8 days of power remaining. This means that anything researched there at
this time will provide no benefit to SEAS. If you are in need of your Credits and Points, then it's ok to Research your artifacts on the current station. However, if you can wait until the next deployment
of the Xenology Station, this means income for SEAS as well as we typically do earn Command Points from Xenology Scanners. Anytime you are able to Research Artifacts when SEAS is a contributor to a
Xenology Station, it will be very beneficial to SEAS. Additionally, SEAS is not being included on the Temporary Space Stations deployed in 287, the Radio bubble area. This is of no consequence as we don't
earn any income even when we do contribute. We like to contribute because we're at least giving something back to support another vital income-producing area. We are not going to be added to the out of
Comms Asteroid Cluster. This is thanks to Erik Goodwin who as you all know has a rather ugly attitude in general. This Asteroid Cluster yields very nice income and a little extra in points as well as
Asteroid hauling provides Command points to SEAS. However, it isn't utilized by many pilots because one has to travel to 287 and then to 288 to reach this area. Most don't want to take the extra time as
well as one must qualify for the Comms Override Upgrade from the Torus Xenology Center to be able to navigate back to the Asteroid Processor from another sector. Not many follow through to maintain the
288 Asteroid Cluster so one can hope that a change in management in the future will yield more friendly results for SEAS. Last, we are not being included on the Temporary Space Stations which support
travel to and from GMG. There is a Toll station which requires a 20,000,000 Credits Toll and this yielded about a million in income to SEAS. This is nice income but it is not a heavily utilized area so
we'll not be losing anything significant for not being included on the Temporary Stations which access GMG. This is because of Damien Goss who, as you know has a similar perspective as Goodwin's. As I
said in the message I posted, we've at least made some progress on being able to earn income for our organization again and for that I am deeply grateful. [18:01  1 October 2317 GST]

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great
view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around
with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table
to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
