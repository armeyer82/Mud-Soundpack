00:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

00:08 The yelling of soldiers and gunfire permeate the air.

00:10 Explosions begin to ring out all around. An officer begins to shout to take cover just as a bomb bursts nearby. A burning wave of fire and blinding light instantly consumes everything, and all you can see is smoke and swirling mist.

00:10 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

00:12 Lily Kaise dangles a day old hot personal vegetable pizza in front of a Tardick lizard named Asteria. The lizard's tongue flicks out once, then its head lunges forward, snapping up the food in a sudden blur and immediately swallowing it whole.

00:12 Lily Kaise says, "Ow."

00:12 You kiss Lily Kaise.

00:28 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
A dusty, earthy smell permeates the hot and dry air. The ship seems to be constantly shaking, bumping along its path. From the front of the ship you hear a faint animal grunt, like the whinnying of horses. The flooring seems wooden and the walls are soft like fabric, almost warm to the touch. Outside the windows, the ship appears to be progressing down a cobbled road. Grass stretches away before fading to mist. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a personal hoverpallet, Purr the humanoid service robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug here.
Lily Kaise is lying on a narrow bunks.
You can go out.

00:30 Lily says to you, "I love you too Babe."

00:30 I don't understand that.

00:30 I don't understand that.

00:31 You smile at Lily Kaise.

00:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

00:37 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

00:39 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

00:52 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

00:57 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

01:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

01:03 The carriage shakes slightly as the horses pick up their pace.

01:12 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

01:12 The mist transforms slowly into a smoky haze of warm colors. They begin to throb slowly in a strangely pleasurable way.

01:20 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

01:29 I don't understand that.

01:29 You can't wear a glossy purple ceramic felo chow bowl.

01:31 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

01:32 You can't go that way.

01:34 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:01 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

02:02 Pleasure pulses through your body in time with the throbbing of the colors.

02:03 The throbbing of the colors increases in pace, and with it, the pleasure of experiencing them.

02:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

02:13 You kiss Lily Kaise.

02:13 The throbbing of the warm colors intensifies, peaks with a sudden brightening, and then subsides entirely. The colors fade, replaced by swirling mist.

02:13 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

02:19 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:29 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

02:32 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

02:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:43 The ship's hull creaks as it travels through space, but it sounds like the creaking of wooden planks rather than of metal hull plates.

02:49 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Hey Jim? You round?"

02:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

02:51 The ship suddenly rises up a steep wave and then crashes back down as the wind rises.

03:02 A sudden splashing sound draws your attention to a tailfin just now disappearing beneath the ocean waves.

03:03 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:07 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

03:12 A briefly alarming screech turns out to be the cry of a seagull as it circles overhead.

03:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:16 The smell of salt and the sounds of the waves slowly begin to fade, until once more nothing but a formless void surrounds the ship.

03:16 The swirling mist parts to reveal a gaping mouth! Before you can react, the ship has plunged into it and into a fleshy pink tunnel.

03:23 I don't understand that.

03:23 I don't understand that.

03:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:38 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

03:46 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

03:46 I don't understand that.

03:48 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

03:57 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

03:59 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:13 The ship pushes through an endless pink fleshy tunnel.

04:17 The pink tunnel enclosing the ship seems to shrink, slowing its progress.

04:18 The ship shudders and creaks as powerful muscles squeeze it, then it is suddenly ejected into swirling mist.

04:18 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

04:21 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:31 The snow comes down more thickly by the second.

04:31 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

04:43 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

04:45 The snow grows deeper and progress toward the city slows.

04:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

04:56 The group slowly struggles closer to the city.

05:01 The snow grows deeper and progress toward the city slows.

05:04 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

05:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria settles down, curling its limbs inward. Its eyes close slowly and it appears to sleep.

05:11 The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.

05:18 The snow grows deeper and progress toward the city slows.

05:19 The group arrives at the outskirts of the city. It is frozen and windswept, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. Some of the group cry out in dismay, dropping to their knees in despair as the snow flies more thickly, obscuring your vision.

05:19 The mist clears and reveals that the ship is parked on an expanse of brightly-colored squares. The square directly underneath seems to be marked, "GO!"

Subject: Thank you

I know everyone has a lot of questions, and believe me, my team is doing its best to draw what conclusions we can from the data we gathered. While it might be tempting to believe we left in defeat, we did complete our primary objectives. We confirmed the accuracy of the Outsider databanks. We discovered who and what the Fwoof-Foom are. And we made contact... of a sort. In addition, we got the first up close and personal look at an Outsider blockade station, as well as the first kill of one, a feat that will stun the team back home. I will ensure both crews receive due credit for that accomplishment.

If you feel we left in haste, I apologize. I have scouted many, many unexplored planets, and lost friends and colleagues in the process. One of my primary instructions to you all was, "Don't get greedy." We suffered a casualty almost immediately upon making contact with this species. With our primary objectives fulfilled, my gut told me it would be too risky to try for a bonus round. While I've been nothing but impressed with the way these crews have conducted themselves, it's also the case that none of you are trained in first contact or survival on alien worlds. I didn't want to be responsible for any casualties among you, especially when a couple of you began talking like you wanted to follow in Georg
05:38 ie's footsteps.

I am told that Georgie is stable for now. He has been kept sedated and we aren't sure how he'll progress. We don't know what affect the alien spores may have on him. We hope the answer is "none," but given that we witnessed an Outsider with one of those head stalks, I'm not willing to just assume that he'll be fine.

Whatever happens, we will be back. This was only the first step. Even if the Fwoof-Foom will never be our allies, every world and every species has something to teach us. When we come back, we'll be prepared. Forewarned is forearmed. We will keep trying to achieve rational discourse with this species, and all of you will have a place in that process, if you want it.

And once again, thank you. All of you.

I fully support your decision to leave and thanks for clarifying a little more. Safety of the crew is of the utmost importance.

I for one, will be happy to go on any mission that there is a spot for me on.

We were told to expect the unexpected and, boy we got that. Again, thank you for working with us.

06:21 Suddenly, you hear a cry of rage. Giant hands appear out of nowhere and flip the entire game board! Cards, dice, and the ship all go spinning into swirling mist.

06:21 Listen. You need to be careful.

06:27 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

06:51 Do you know what they want?

06:55 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

07:00 You have to want to go somewhere, don't you?

07:11 Terrible things. They want to do terrible things.

07:21 They're just using you.

07:23 Remember what I said.

07:23 The viewports are briefly obscured by dark shadows, and you feel the ship bumping up and down as if hitting atmospheric turbulence. When the shadows pass, sunlight streams in from outside and you can see the ship is being carried along a forest floor by a procession of black ants.

07:45 Several obstacles in the path cause the ant procession to slowly zig-zag around them.

07:55 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:06 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:06 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

08:16 The ship bumps along the forest floor, passing by several mossy rocks.

08:23 A formless mist suddenly swirls outside the viewports, then is rapidly sucked forward into a bright wormhole in front of the ship. The wormhole blinks out of existence, and the ship is suddenly in normal space.

08:38 Something deep inside the starship roars to life as the lights dim sharply.

08:38 A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear almost immediately.

08:38 The mists part, the curtains open, and countless faceless humanoids stare at you from their seats.

08:40 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Zéro Des Cartes/General.

08:54 Ali Candan's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'll be around for many hours Mel. Most likely 16."

08:58 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

09:06 A Tardick lizard named Asteria shifts and then wakes, opening its yellow eyes slowly.

09:07 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

09:08 The crowd emits a low, keening drone at you.

09:15 Blockade Smasher Hawthorn Dunn's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I'm awake."

09:18 A member of the audience's lack of face suddenly twists into itself, forming countless mouths, gasping for relief.

09:18 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:28 You cough out a small globule of thick, viscuous sludge.

09:32 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

09:38 The curtains close, to no applause. The stage grows dark, then the darkness gives way to swirling mist.

09:38 The formless mists suddenly resolve into a dust-laden wind. After a moment the dust settles, and one of the horses in front of you lets out a quiet whicker as the carriage's wheels creak ceaselessly below.

09:42 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

09:54 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

10:08 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

10:11 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

10:19 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

10:23 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

10:30 A white bird flashes by over the plain.

10:34 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

10:40 A sudden cloud of dust is kicked up, obscuring your vision, turning all to swirling mist.

10:40 A fiery cloud of pyroclastic ash emerges from the mist and roars through the starship, burning the walls away. When it passes, the ship is a drifting platform hovering through a barren hellscape covered in ash. A volcano spews ash and fire into the blackened sky as glowing lava flows down its sides. The scorched remains of trees, animals, and humans caught in the blast litter the ground.

10:40 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

10:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

10:57 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:08 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

11:10 Several impish creatures circle the platform, flapping bat-like wings while snarling and chattering at each other. They lose interest and fly off.

11:13 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

11:22 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

11:24 Bolts of lightning crackle through the dense cloud looming over the volcanic crater.

11:34 You hear tormented cries and wailing off in the distance, but cannot determine where they are coming from.

11:36 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

11:40 The ground below shakes violently as the eruptions from the volcano intensify. The platform speeds up to avoid the falling, fiery debris.

11:43 The ground trembles as the volcano erupts violently. The entire mountain is blown apart in the distance. You see the pyroclastic blast rushing toward you before you even hear the sound of the eruption, and the moment it reaches you, it disappears into a swirling mist and the starship is once more whole.

11:43 The mist swirls quickly, then suddenly evaporates, leaving you in an alien landscape. Tall grassed plains stretch on as far as the eye can see, as the planet's sun is slowly setting on the horizon.

11:50 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:00 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

12:07 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

12:15 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:17 A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by peacefully.

12:27 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

12:28 A gentle breeze rustles through the grass, causing ripple-like waves.

12:33 The wind gusts more forcefully, stirring the grass sharply.

12:36 Lily Kaise removes a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

12:36 Lily Kaise gives you a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizard named Asteria.

12:38 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

12:39 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

12:44 A herd of large, six-legged creatures with thick, slate blue skin wander by peacefully.

12:45 A heavy wind suddenly rushes over the plains as a large cloud of mist rolls in, obscuring your vision.

12:45 The mist transitions into thick swirling snowflakes. The ship is strapped to the back of a traveler clothed in thick layers, part of a group struggling through deep snow towards a distant, snow-swept city.

12:51 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.

13:02 Lily Kaise blinks heavily and then dozes off.

13:02 Lily Kaise lies back on a narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it and goes to sleep.

13:02 A Tardick lizard named Asteria's spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.

13:04 The swirling snowflakes thin out a little.

13:14 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:15 The city slowly grows nearer... too slowly.

13:25 One of the group falls down into the snow. Others struggle past, too exhausted to help.

13:25 A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

13:31 A Tardick lizard named Zeus trundles slowly into the area.

13:32 A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tail.

13:35 A baby wails, its cries muffled by a thick swaddling of blankets.

13:40 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

13:46 A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tail.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

18:25 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Living Quarters Four]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a personal hoverpallet here.

I entirely echo what Mel says and will be honoured to work with the team again should the chance arise. Thanks to everybody involved.

I am in complete agreement with how we left and why.
It was an honor to work with you and your team, and I will be more than happy to step up for another mission, should you have need of me.
Thank you for giving me the chance to be a part of something like this.

It has been so eexciting to be a part of this process Mister Gruffudd. To learn the process see the inner workings of how a team like this operates, and to figure out that the race we were studying were so much different than what anyone could've expected. It was an honor. I am so glad it's something I can give as a story to my friends, colleagues, all of that sort of thing.

What I do hope is that you and your loved ones, and friends can weather this time well, and that you and the doctors can help Georgy. My thoughts are with you.

I really, really hope Georgie gets better. He was so excited and loving his space adventure. Let's hope he can recover fully and go on many more adventures.

I do hope Georgie will recover fully. I also look forward to revisiting in future. While admittedly slightly disappointed with the short duration of our stay, I fully understand that safety takes precedent. You can count on me to volunteer for any future missions of this nature.

I so appreciate having had the opportunity to participate with this mission. Although we always remain optimistic concerning expected results, we certainly cannot predict outcomes based upon unknown factors. I am very impressed with how EAOS and crew have managed throughout this operation. I hope for the best recovery for Georgie and my thoughts are with him as he recovers. Thank you for the invitation to participate. If I am available for future work on this project, I will be honored to be involved.

Subject: Dropped out, Georgie is awake and symptomatic
Author: Morris Corlew

At 11.78LTC traveled, we received a request from the Zéro Des Cartes crew that we drop out of the rift. Once we had, we were told that Georgie was in their control room. He now has an orange stalk coming from his head. We attempted to reach Jim with no success. The sedation apparently is not working as well as it was. He is requesting to return to Hwoom-Hoom. I asked that the crew there let him know that our window for making it with charge is over and his request was denied. We resumed course once we were informed that Mike had been able to get him back into their dome and he was not violent. I also informed the other crew that we will have a mandatory stop later today due to needing to charge. Any additional information will be provided by the other crew in reply to this post.

Mike also informed us that the stalk was not contageous, yet.

As Morris stated, he was nonviolent, I was able to bring him back to the dome peacefully.

It is my strongest recommendation that we send Georgie, and several members of the FCI team home in a pod to A, limit exposure if it does become contageous, and B, to prevent him or any future infected person from hindering our return to alliance space. As pods have a few preprogrammed destination, their getting home is assured.

Morris is account is true. I'll just give an acount of what happened on my end.
I was just hanging out in the Observation deck when Georgie asked us over the PA system if we could help him in the control room. At first I went up there to meet him, and Tobias and Goss came shortly after. But then I worried for a moment and took Goss and Tobias into my group and insisted we put our suits on just in case. So I put on my suit and we went back into the control room to Georgie. He said he was trying to turn us around, but couldn't figure out how the controlboard worked. He thinks we should go back. I told him to go back to sleep, back to his dome, and we'd discuss going back once Jim or Ellen was around. I hope we're not going back though. I was just trying to soothe him, and convince him to go back to his dome. That stock growing out of his head was disturbing. Johann took him to the docking bay where the dome was, and when we got there, Mike and Johann and Georgie was there. After some attempts at soothing him from Johann and I, Georgie didn't seem to be resistent, and Mike was able to take him back to the dome.

I'd wait and see what jim and the team suggest. If I am correct they have a biologist, an isolated dome and methods of locking it. I'm concerned that by sending the Eaos crew off and separating them from us we're not only limiting our resources, but also hurting Georgy's chance of survival.

Thought I would post this as an update for those who weren't alert. Jim has informed us that Georgie is under heavier sedation and is also now physically restrained. He's also stated that the other dome is much better equipped to take care of him where they are than in an escape pod.

18:30 Logged out of FTL Message Board Net.

18:30 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

18:31 You say to Lily, "I just read the posts."

18:31 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap and a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI patch on the shoulder. She is also wearing a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly containing a Tardick lizar
18:31 d named Asteria. Her face, both eyes, both wrists, both hands, and both feet are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

18:31 Lily Kaise nods.

18:32 Lily Kaise says, "So yeah let's hope it's still contained."

18:32 You nod to Lily Kaise.

18:33 Lily Kaise says, "Morris kept saying send them back in a Pod and Jim said no and so on so there was a bit of going back and forth on that one. At any rate, it seems to be sorted but be prepared to go to Quarantine when we get back."

18:33 You nod to Lily Kaise. "YEah, that's what I gathered."

18:34 Lily Kaise says, "I doubt we'll be sending stuff across to the other ship or going over there as we really don't know if when Georgie came out if he exposed the others."

18:34 You say, "Yeah, I'd rather not go over there."

18:34 Lily Kaise nods.

18:34 Lily Kaise says, "Me either."

18:35 You squeeze Lily Kaise affectionately.

I know everyone has a lot of questions, and believe me, my team is doing its best to draw what conclusions we can from the data we gathered. While it might be tempting to believe we left in defeat, we did complete our primary objectives. We confirmed the accuracy of the Outsider databanks. We discovered who and what the Fwoof-Foom are. And we made contact... of a sort. In addition, we got the first up close and personal look at an Outsider blockade station, as well as the first kill of one, a feat that will stun the team back home. I will ensure both crews receive due credit for that accomplishment.

If you feel we left in haste, I apologize. I have scouted many, many unexplored planets, and lost friends and colleagues in the process. One of my primary instructions to you all was, "Don't get greedy." We suffered a casualty almost immediately upon making contact with this species. With our primary objectives fulfilled, my gut told me it would be too risky to try for a bonus round. While I've been nothing but impressed with the way these crews have conducted themselves, it's also the case that none of you are trained in first contact or survival on alien worlds. I didn't want to be responsible for any casualties among you, especially when a couple of you began talking like you wanted to follow in Georg
18:38 ie's footsteps.

I am told that Georgie is stable for now. He has been kept sedated and we aren't sure how he'll progress. We don't know what affect the alien spores may have on him. We hope the answer is "none," but given that we witnessed an Outsider with one of those head stalks, I'm not willing to just assume that he'll be fine.

Whatever happens, we will be back. This was only the first step. Even if the Fwoof-Foom will never be our allies, every world and every species has something to teach us. When we come back, we'll be prepared. Forewarned is forearmed. We will keep trying to achieve rational discourse with this species, and all of you will have a place in that process, if you want it.

And once again, thank you. All of you.

18:52 "No kidding!" You nod to Lily Kaise.

18:52 The formless shifting void gradually acquires a regular crest and fall until, after several moments, you suddenly realize you are on a wide expanse of ocean. Tall wooden masts creak above you, and white canvas sails snap in the breeze.

You see a long plasteel counter, a pair of narrow bunks with a large purple bed pillow on it, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, Kiska the humanoid service robot, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, a large periwinkle bed pillow, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, and a personal hoverpallet here.
You can go out.

20:12 You sniff at yourself. You smell the fresh fragrance of a sun-warmed grassy meadow.

20:12 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Mid]

20:12 You can go north, east, south, and west.

20:12 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Crew Quarters; Fore]
You can go north, east, south, west, and up.

20:12 [Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Forward Observation]

20:12 You see an oval navy blue area rug, a mahogany coffee table, a tall mahogany bookcase, a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it, a small black trash can, a round light gray glazed ceramic pot containing a bamboo plant, a silver projector, a very soft quilted light blue sleeping mat, a large silky sapphire quilt embroidered with pink and light purple butterflies, Tegan the small circular sanitation bot, a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a tropical beach chair, a nylon relaxation hammock, a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe, a sparkly ouija board, a medium-sized crystal ball, and a silver plastic box labeled 'Movies!' here.
Constantine Stone is standing here. Ryan Thomas and Ali Candan are sitting on a charcoal gray velvet sofa.
You can go east, south, and west.

20:12 You can't go that way.

20:12 You sit down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:12 I see no "lily" here.

20:13 The damage control systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

20:13 Lily Kaise walks in from the south.

20:13 Constantine Stone waves.

20:13 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:13 You wave to Constantine Stone.

20:13 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Morris, can you post? I didn't get the distance. Also, add a total distance estimate too please?"

20:13 Lily Kaise waves to Constantine Stone.

20:13 Morris Corlew's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "I can. And sure."

20:13 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

20:13 Morris Corlew shuffles in from the south.

20:13 Constantine Stone says nothing.

20:14 Morris Corlew says, "Hey."

20:14 Constantine Stone asks, "So what's this, Best recalled the rogue navy?"

20:14 Morris Corlew begins sitting cross-legged on an oval navy blue area rug.

20:14 Constantine says to Morris, "Hey."

20:14 Morris Corlew nods to Constantine Stone.

20:14 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

20:14 Morris says to Constantine, "Welcomed 'em...and investigatin Janus. My guess is it's a monkey court."

20:14 Constantine Stone says, "When was that incident, where they launched the beacon in Mutuality space."

20:14 Morris Corlew asks, "2309?"

20:14 Constantine Stone gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:14 Lily says to Constantine, "Hey, you need to speak with Ather. It would probably be best if you met in person but since we're not suggesting anyone board the other ship at this time, just keep it in mind that you will likely want to speak with Ather at some point."

20:15 Constantine Stone asks, "Yeah, you're probably right. Are you guys going to give evidence against Janus?"

20:15 Constantine Stone asks, "Were you pilots back then?"

20:15 Constantine Stone says, "I guess Ather probably was."

20:15 Morris Corlew says, "I wasn't, no."

20:15 Morris Corlew says, "Nissi was, Keegan was I believe."

20:15 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:15 Constantine Stone says, "Oh, I meant Lily and Shule."

20:15 Morris Corlew says, "Anfisa."

20:15 Lily Kaise says, "No as I have none however, we're likely going to do more drastic."

20:15 Morris Corlew says, "Oh."

20:16 Constantine Stone says, "I mean in an ideal world they would listen to the testimony of anyone who took part in the battle."

20:16 Constantine Stone says, "But I don't see that happening."

20:16 Lily says to Constantine, "Anyway, this really isn't the place I'm just being Ather's messenger."
Morris Corlew says, "Not sure if they'll even take testimony."

20:16 The voice of Tobias Hawthorne comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying, "0.n7L until our battery is full, shovelling complete."

20:16 Morris Corlew says, "It's an investigation...not a hearin."

20:16 Constantine Stone asks, "Why isn't this the place?"

20:16 Constantine Stone asks, "For what?"

20:17 Lily says to Constantine, "To discuss my personal decisions or Shules or AEU affairs."

20:17 Constantine Stone says, "Okay."

20:17 Morris Corlew navigates his metallic silver touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

20:17 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in Local Ship Message Board/Blackwing Yalobusha/General.

20:17 Morris Corlew switches a metallic silver touch einrophone off.

20:18 Morris Corlew says into the PA microphone, "That work, Mel?"

20:18 Melinda Michaels's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Sure."

20:19 Ryan Thomas stands up from a charcoal gray velvet sofa with a dusky blue cotton fleece blanket, a navy blue velvet throw pillow, and a chocolate brown velvet throw pillow on it.

20:19 Ryan Thomas roams south.

20:19 Ryan Thomas roams in from the south.

20:19 Morris Corlew says, "We could uh...give y'all some privacy if you'd like."

20:19 Ryan Thomas says, "Or they could go to their quarters."

20:20 Constantine Stone says, "I don't really see what the big deal is, but I can always find out later."

20:20 Ryan Thomas says, "Or....wait."

20:20 Lily Kaise glances at Constantine Stone.

20:22 Lily Kaise stands up from a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:22 Lily says to Constantine, "Please come with me."

20:23 Constantine Stone says, "We don't have to do it now. I just meant, I don't get why we're worried about secrecy."

20:23 Lily Kaise shrugs helplessly.

20:23 Constantine Stone says, "We already know they don't care what we say or do."

20:23 Constantine Stone chuckles.

20:23 Lily Kaise says, "It's personal Constantine can't you at least respect me."

20:23 Constantine Stone says, "Of course."

20:23 Morris Corlew says, "Some things are...considered...alliance-only. I imagine there's somethin League and Fringe ain't meant to know."

20:23 Constantine Stone joins Lily Kaise's group.

20:23 Lily Kaise says, "But I may not have time to talk with you later so either come with me now or you may never know."

20:24 Lily Kaise's group walks south.

20:24 Ryan Thomas says, "Woow."

20:24 Ryan Thomas says, "I never have understood the AEU."

20:24 Morris Corlew gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.

20:24 Ryan Thomas says, "Weird as fuck people."
Morris Corlew looks at Ryan Thomas and shrugs.

20:25 Morris Corlew says, "I get it. There's a reason our conference doors have locks only we can open and why we have our own encrypted alliance channels. The respect me thing though...was a bit bafflin. Figure she just meant respect the situation though."

20:26 Morris Corlew says, "I mean...not like renouncin citizenship actually does any good. It takes away their protections while leavin 'em open to government demands. So I guess they have another plan they ain't ready to share with the rest of us."

20:29 Constantine Stone walks in from the south.

20:29 Constantine Stone says, "I'm more confused."

20:29 Constantine Stone shrugs.

20:29 Constantine Stone sits down.

20:29 Morris Corlew asks, "Oh?"

20:29 Ryan Thomas shrugs.

20:29 Constantine Stone says, "I just want to point out that this has all already been posted on the message board. I didn't mean to make anyone air their dirty laundry."

20:29 Constantine Stone says, "I thought it was all already aired."

20:29 Ryan Thomas says, "I dunno. Lily's Lily."

20:29 Morris Corlew grins at Ryan Thomas.

20:30 Ryan says to Constantine, "Lily's a pain in everyone's ass. Welcome to the club."

20:30 Morris says to Constantine, "I dunno. Don't bother none of us to talk bout it."

20:30 Morris says to Constantine, "I just figured maybe she had some plan to share with you that wasn't ready for bein spread round to other alliances."

20:30 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe Ather has one."

20:31 Constantine Stone says, "I'll find out later I guess."

20:31 Morris Corlew says, "Hopefully somethin better'n renouncin citizenship."

20:31 Constantine Stone asks, "Is that just basically retirement?"

20:31 Morris Corlew says, "Gives the government the advantage and y'all nothin."

20:31 Morris Corlew says, "No...your contract would still stand as I understand it."

20:31 Constantine Stone asks, "Would we have docking rights anywhere though?"

20:31 Morris Corlew says, OOCly, "Constantine, there was a couple help files added recently under help citizenship. That might clear some things up for you."

20:31 Lily Kaise walks in from the south.

20:31 Constantine Stone says, "I guess mutuality space."

20:32 Lily Kaise sits down on a large white and turquoise paisley floor pillow with thick silver fringe.

20:32 Ali Candan scrambles to his feet.

20:32 Ali Candan strides south.

20:34 Constantine Stone says, "Hmm."

20:34 Constantine Stone says, "Well, we'll see how it shakes out."

20:34 Morris Corlew nods.

20:39 Lily Kaise navigates her metallic gold touch einrophone to a text-heavy application and peers at the screen.

20:40 Lily Kaise switches a metallic gold touch einrophone off.

20:44 Morris Corlew says, "I'll be back in a few."

21:59 Constantine Stone says, "Huh, interesting."

22:00 A Tardick lizard named Freyja curls its tail loosely around Wendy Arroyo's neck.

22:00 Morris Corlew says, "So now we're pretty sure we know why the Outsiders want to avoid the area and why they lost contact with their battle team."

22:00 Constantine Stone asks, "Did those environmental scanners pick up anything interesting?"

22:00 Morris Corlew says, "Just that long-term exposure wasn't recommended."

22:00 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

22:02 Morris Corlew says, "Pizza, pleasure...either way, Georgie's got a stalk stickin outta his head and wants to go back there."

22:03 Lily Kaise nods.

22:03 Constantine Stone says, "Maybe it's a mozzarella stick."

22:03 A sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device bips quietly.

22:03 Lily Kaise says, "So they'll create a stalk farm and turn it onto outsiders. We'll just aim stalks at outsiders from now on."

22:03 Wendy Arroyo says, "A mozzarella stalk."

22:03 Lily Kaise laughs.

22:03 Morris Corlew says, "Definitely doin the carrot on the forehead thing."
