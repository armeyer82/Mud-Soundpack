-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

01:00 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:00 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:00 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:00 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:00 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:00 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:00 The ship is already moving.

01:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:00 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:00 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:00 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:00 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

01:01 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:01 New Earth rotates through space before you, a startingly verdant planet, colored in greens and blues with pure white clouds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to New Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:01 Via general sector communication, New Earth transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

01:01 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

01:01 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:01 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:01 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:01 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

01:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:01 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:02 The computer is unable to locate your coordinates while you are not in open space.

01:02 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:02 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:02 You scramble to your feet.

01:02 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This office is small but elegant, the recessed lighting shining softly over pale green carpet, silvery white walls, and a modestly sized modern steel desk with an ergonomically designed mesh and leather chair behind it. Arranged in front of the desk are several other chairs, while ferns in white pots occupy the corners of the office, and on the walls are framed images of sleek AEU starships. The door is open.
You see the Space Defense Captain terminal and a large metal filing cabinet here.

(You finish reading.)

01:06 You grab a large rubber stamp, pound it onto the 04:00 05/12 AEU space defense report, then fling the document into the Outgoing pile.

01:06 I see no "report" here.

01:06 You grab the door handle as you leave.

01:06 The door to the west suddenly closes.
[New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]
You can go north, east, south, and west.

01:06 [New Earth; Pilot Corps Liaison Office; Corridor]

01:06 You can go north, east, south, and west.

You can go north, up, and out.

01:06 [New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]

01:06 You see an automatic teller machine and a small trash can here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

01:06 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

01:06 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

01:06 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:06 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:06 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:06 You sit down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

01:09 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

01:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:09 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:09 You're already sitting.

01:09 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

01:09 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:09 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:09 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:09 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:09 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

01:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:09 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:09 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:09 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:09 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

01:09 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:10 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:10 The computer reports that the bari spreader "Bari Spreader 602" has released a cloud of spores.

01:10 You hear several peculiar, barely audible clangs outside of the ship's walls, followed by some scraping sounds.

01:10 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:10 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:10 A small horde of larval bari just arrived.

01:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:10 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:11 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:11 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:11 You scramble to your feet.

01:11 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:11 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

01:11 [The Torus; Garage]

01:11 You can go up.

01:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

01:11 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and a small mystic purple bioplastic crate here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

01:11 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small white trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing red and amber aquatic life and coral rocks, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.

01:11 I can't find "sofa."

01:11 I don't understand that.

01:11 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:11 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

01:12 A long violet soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at a white plastic undersea castle and clings to it for a moment, then jets off.

01:14 An oversized semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior pulsates gently.

01:20 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with long dangling tendrils and a blue glowing interior drifts slowly past a plastic shipwreck flying a pirate flag.

01:22 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters into the area.

01:26 A large semi-transparent bell-shaped creature with long dangling tendrils and a sienna glowing interior drifts slowly across the tank.

01:28 Lily Kaise suddenly awakens.

01:28 Lily Kaise wraps her arms around you, pulling you close.

01:29 You kiss Lily Kaise.

01:29 You say to Lily, "Hi my love."

01:29 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:29 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:30 Lily Kaise turns on her metallic gold touch einrophone and taps at it briefly.

01:31 You say to Lily, "Hi my love."

01:31 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins crouches down for a moment.

01:32 Lily says to you, "Hi love."

01:32 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

01:33 You wrap your arms around Lily Kaise, pulling her close.

01:33 Lily Kaise says, "Be right back want to check on a few things. You know that either by Sunday or yesterday, the two months period for AEU to be separate from Accord have come and gone."

01:34 Lily Kaise asks, "Ather hasn't said anything has he?"

01:34 Lily Kaise says, "Ok be back in a few."

01:34 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

01:34 Lily Kaise kisses you.

01:34 Lily Kaise glides out.

01:34 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

01:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I don't know if he's said anything over comms. I haven't been arnound all day."

01:35 There appear to be about 11 pilots recently active.

01:35 The communicator network detects:

01:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Ok."

01:35 You glance at your communicator's screen.

01:35 There are no notices.

01:36 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough yellow tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

01:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "We still have access to the starships on Accord."

01:38 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ah ok."

01:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Remember it was mentioned that we might not be able to purchase the Gemini anymore?"

01:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Maybe I should by a module transport and the module transport scout while I can?"

01:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah."

01:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Well up to you. I'm certainly not letting mine go."

01:39 A hairy yellow eight-legged ArachnoPal named Higgins skitters south.

01:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "And I bought the other Gemini."

01:39 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yeah."

01:40 You scramble to your feet.

01:40 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and a small mystic purple bioplastic crate here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:40 You exit the ship.

01:40 [The Torus; Garage]
You can go up.

01:41 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]

01:41 You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:41 [Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]

01:41 You see a tiger stripe leather sofa, a soft rectangular white rug with a design of black and cinnamon brown cats, and a black leather captain's chair here.
You can go south and out.

01:41 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:41 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:41 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:41 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

01:41 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:41 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:41 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:41 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:41 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

01:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:41 A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:41 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Beacon C-12."

01:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:41 A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other, with clouds of debris filling the sector.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:41 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Accord of Free Worlds Command."

01:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:41 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

01:41 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:41 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Kalina. Welcome to Accord space."

01:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh gods shule you have bari in your flare."

01:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I do?"

01:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Get it out of here."

01:42 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:42 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:42 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

01:42 A voice says over the speaker, "Roger, cleared to land at this Accord of Free Worlds port."

01:42 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I'll meet you with felo."

01:42 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hang on. Be right there."

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]
A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).
The starship is already moving.

01:43 Please do not enter so many commands at once.
Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Kalina! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:43 The starship is already moving.

01:43 The starship is already moving.
You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:43 The ship's current engine speed is 6000 km/s.

01:43 At that speed, the ship will arrive at its current autopilot destination in about 10.0 seconds.

01:44 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 911" has jumped into the sector.

01:44 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:44 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:44 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Registered Merchant 911! Welcome to The Torus!"

01:44 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Kalina. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

01:44 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

01:44 You may not power down the ship while it is in flight.

01:44 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

01:44 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:44 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:44 You scramble to your feet.

01:44 [Starship "Kalina"; Airlock]
You see a row of flightlockers here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:44 You exit the ship.
[The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" and the four-person light carrier "Kalina" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

01:44 [The Torus; Garage]

01:44 You can go up.

01:44 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]

You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north and down.

01:44 [The Torus; Dock Alpha]
The pale gray walls, floor, and ceiling of this massive EAOS docking bay glow with a pale white light. Though the bay remains open to space, it somehow also retains its atmosphere. Outside, you can see the bright glint of a solitary blue-white star. Signs indicate that the repair and rearm facility, the starship supply store, and the main concourse are to the north. A light dusting of mold spores is scattered across the landing area.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" and the four-person light carrier "Kalina" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.

01:44 I don't understand that.

01:44 I don't understand that.

01:44 You can't go that way.

01:44 [The Torus; Garage]

01:44 The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the day of its construction. Not a drop of machine oil spoils the gleaming pale gray metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the structure seems to glow of its own accord. The distinct smell of death is emanating from the four-person mule "Daisy May".
You can go up.

01:44 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Airlock]

01:44 You see a glossy blue ceramic felo chow bowl and a big albino felo here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

01:44 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]

01:44 You see a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow bowl, Mekensie the humanoid service robot, and a hefty orange soldier felo here.

01:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:45 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and a small horde of larval bari here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "AHHHHH!"

01:45 You put down a hefty orange soldier felo.

01:45 You put down a frisky hefty white soldier felo.

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Where are you?"

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ahh!"

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey guys."

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "In my flare on dock alpha."

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Got a couple of felo."

01:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:45 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small horde of larval bari, a hefty orange soldier felo, and a frisky hefty white soldier felo here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Is there a bari thingie?"

01:45 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]

01:45 You see an improved temporary wormhole drive, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a bari hive here.
You can go west.

01:45 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh did you bring in felo to kill the bari and launch which you shoule. Ah, it hurts!"

01:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Want me to drop the bomb?"

01:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:46 You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small horde of larval bari, a hefty orange soldier felo, and a frisky hefty white soldier felo here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:46 A frisky hefty white soldier felo viciously attacks a small horde of larval bari, crushing the small creatures in its teeth.

01:46 A frisky hefty white soldier felo appears to have killed off a small horde of larval bari.

01:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoa, are you okay, Lily?"

01:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Uh not on the torus. Oh, the pain!"

01:46 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

01:46 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:46 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:46 You pick up a hefty orange soldier felo.

01:46 You pick up a frisky hefty white soldier felo.

01:46 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:46 You put down a frisky hefty white soldier felo.

01:46 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I just didn't have time to launch yet."

01:46 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Weapons Room]

01:46 Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport. The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

01:47 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Where are you?"

01:47 A frisky hefty white soldier felo and a hefty orange soldier felo efficiently break apart a bari hive.

01:47 A hefty orange soldier felo rubs up against a frisky hefty white soldier felo, and both animals purr softly.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

01:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Constatnine, can you check New Earth? See if there is bari there? That's the only place my flare has been today."

01:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Er, Constantine."

01:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't see anything amiss at the landing pad."

01:48 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Maybe in space? Check providence?"

AEU capsule "Sparklehawk" departed to AEU sector Providence Gate (Alpha-1) approximately 7 minutes ago.

02:00 There are no other ships in the sector.

02:00 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

02:00 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:06 [Starship "Firestorm"; Engineering Room]

02:06 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

02:36 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:36 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:36 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

02:36 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:36 [Tactical Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "Michael, to save you some trouble, any sector beta-2 or higher goes to flight control, so as long as the cluster gateway sector is beta-2 or higher, and you check the cluster, you won't need to recheck it unless you hear something on flight control."

02:36 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:36 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 911" has jumped out of the sector.

02:36 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Accord Of Free Worlds Command. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Dusty Reaches."

02:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:36 [Tactical Communication] Michael Kennedy transmits, "Ah ok."

02:36 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:36 A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:37 Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits, "Hello, Kalina. Welcome to Accord space."

03:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:24 A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.

23:30 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
