Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

Unlike the control room, a starship's weapon room has only one tiny viewport.
The focus of the room is a slightly miniaturized starmap, augmented with
additional spatial relationship information and various status displays. A
streamlined control board sits before the starmap, with prominent indicators for
lock status and weapon readiness. Control boards for the ship's weaponry are off
to either side, to be pulled into place at a moment's notice. The status lights
overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see
that the ship is in a garage.
You see a silky electric blue cushion decorated with embroidered pale blue
flowers, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, Desiree the little black and
white spotted CatBot, a large bubbling azure blue-lit aquarium containing violet
and ocher aquatic life and round rocks, Kiska the humanoid service robot, and
Shule Elemmire's workbench here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "What, me, in a spacesuit,
franticly pushing against a planet screaming at it to fucking move already?"
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU
transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yeah, that."
The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully
charged.

your bet."
[General Communication] Erik Goodwin transmits, "The AEU strike people."

doing greatly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey
Shule, I don't know if you've talked to Eli, but he's now calling for a
full-blown strike on all activity."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Other
than defense against invasions."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "It's all because that Fring
power couple told them to work throught he strike."

[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Fringe even."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "He told
me very early this morning."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I also
set up message beacons in our hub sectors to try to dissuade passing merchants
from trading in our ports."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And I'm
on the scanner looking for merchant activity, hoping I can catch them in our
sectors and ask them not to trade."

listening to them.

of course."

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, just a notice that the strike is now
a full-blown strike on all activity. No beacons, no nests, no artifacting,
nothing at all, save for responding to invasions. It of course has to remain
voluntary, but I'd like to encourage everyone to take part. The Union will leave
the Accord soon if nothing changes. [15:27 22 August 2317 GST]

been watching the terminal? I haven't seen any merchant activity in the past
hour on my scanner."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Which is
surprising, when I was SDC I felt like the merchants never stopped."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Consider not
delivering goods to AEU ports."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just a suggestion,
I know I can't stop you."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't done that in awhile."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Whoever that is."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "No clue who you're talkin to
Constantine."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just saw some
courier activity in Telex and Aenea."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe it wasn't a
civilian pilot, sorry."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "I'm not delivering goods. It's
reports."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Fair enough, just
a suggestion."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Only way we can not do that
with courier ships is to not courier at all, which hurts everyone."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "But if you were
considering it, not getting their reports would probably irk them all the same.
That's the last I'll say about it, sorry."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But then no one would get
reports Constantine."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, I get that."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We can't pick our
destinations."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "You guys will do
what you want, obviously."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I was less talking
about that, and more about the goods/reports distinction."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Same deal there."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone laughs.
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes, I hear what
you're saying."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "If we don't deliver goods to
AEU ports, no one gets goods. Not League, not Fringe, not Mutuality, not EAOS,
nobody."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yes, I
understand."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Y'all need to work out your
own issues internally, seems to me. We can't fix it for ya."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some
activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Thanks."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yhep."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Do we consider not
diverting Outsider patrols something that can potentially hurt everyone?"
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Just curious."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We don't know what
the patrols might stumble on."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I do know we have
been berated and laughed at for continuing to do it, though."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We only do it in one area, and
if the few of you over there stopped doing it, there wouldn't be that many
stopped."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Can we be sure?"
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It's great if
you're sure it won't be a problem."
[General Communication] James Singh transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm just not sure
how you know."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I dunno. How many beacons have
y'all done?"

[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "How many patrols
does it take to be a problem?"

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green
leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

power
You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.
Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate
from the various starship systems.
launch
You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.
A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to
launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

Enter your selection:
A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
uq7Tc^jCp/[32-$^ckYMe{fDn'h)ri5q;5nl0%GP
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Salvage Processing Nuclear Autonav Station in thirty seconds
unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.

Star Conquest Help: Starship Decoration and Maintenance

Category: Game Systems

Starships can be decorated, repainted, and re-lettered to customize their look!
They will also acquire rust, scorch marks, and fade as they are used, so it's up
to you to maintain them if you want them looking nice.
As of this writing, degradation in your ship's appearance does not in fact
reflect any malfunction in your ship's performance.
Starship Decoration
First of all, you can buy paint and lettering stencils at your local starship
supply store. To repaint your ship, type PAINT [ship] WITH PAINT.
If you want to change your ship's lettering, then you simply use that same PAINT
command while holding the stencils you want to use.
You can also apply additions to your ship such as spikes, chains, antennas, and
other things, as well as decals. To do this, type USE [decoration] WITH [ship].
Plaques can be engraved with the ETCH [plaque] command. Be careful, you only
have one shot at etching it!
Decorations and decals can also be painted, but they must be painted before they
are applied, or it will be too late!
Starship Maintenance
The appearance of your ship will degrade over time, as you use it. It will also
acquire the marks of having been in battle. You can fix all of these things with
cleaning supplies from your local starship supply store.
To clean your ship with a cleaning item, type USE [item] WITH [ship].
Checking Out Starships
With all this customizing going on, you want to make sure you go ahead and LOOK
at other people's ships! Want to check out a ship that's in space? No problem!
Type the VISUAL command in your ship's control room, and it will handily zoom in
and provide you with a perfect view!

Do you want to repaint your ship's title with a set of flaming lettering

You apply a set of flaming lettering stencils to the hull of the two-person
flare "Deadly Strike" and carefully paint the ship's title metallic yellow.
l deadly
the two-person flare "Deadly Strike"
You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in flaming metallic yellow letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is gleaming and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. Its landing
struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic
radome on the forward end.

changelog
Recent Minor Changes:
-----
Arachnopals no longer transcend time and space, and now cannot move in
directions beyond our comprehension.
   Posted 6 days, 1 hour, 8 minutes, and 19 seconds ago
-----
At long last, the STANDINGS command now gives far greater detail than a simple
like or dislike! 
Please look forward to new additions to this system in the future.
   Posted 4 days, 17 hours, 41 minutes, and 53 seconds ago
-----
Battlesuit energy may now be checked through roundtime.
   Posted 3 days, 18 hours, and 56 minutes ago
-----
Ships that are unable to salvage (fighters, certain transports, etc) can no
longer deploy atmospheric scoops. This was a bit of an oversight, and we deeply
apologize for any inconvenience that this may cause.
Atmospheric scoops on ships that can no longer do so, of course, be transferred
off.
   Posted 3 days, 10 hours, 26 minutes, and 43 seconds ago
-----
Implemented a fix for ground enemies who fail to react after a failed encounter
is regenerated. Be sure to send a support ticket if you notice this still
happening.
   Posted 3 days, 28 minutes, and 10 seconds ago
-----
The Commissar's report for deleted players in the Mutuality should now sound
somewhat less ominous.
   Posted 2 days, 3 hours, 49 minutes, and 15 seconds ago
-----
The minimum payment for a fine is now one million credits or one fifth of the
fine amount, whichever is smaller.
This will have the effect of reducing the financial strain on people with
moderate to severe fines, as previously it was simply one fifth of the fine
amount, regardless of how large the fine was. In certain instances this means
the minimum payment would reach into the tens of millions or higher.
   Posted 1 day, 9 hours, 44 minutes, and 55 seconds ago
-----
Cadets can no longer use the fund center.
   Posted 1 day, 4 hours, 35 minutes, and 40 seconds ago
-----
A few ground combat changes:
- Spinward suits no longer get gravitics. This made them somewhat too powerful
and took away from the Fringe suit's unique flavour.
- Spinward suits now get blades instead, which are more comparable in damage to
projectiles and rely on swift strikes. Rules of nature!
   Posted 16 hours, 16 minutes, and 6 seconds ago
-----
The RUNDOWN command now displays a starship's controlling faction in place of
its starmap symbol.
   Posted 7 minutes and 58 seconds ago
-----
Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] A load of salvage has been

[MTTS] siekanas: I actually think I preferred the starmap symbol, but that could
change.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Much better. My ship
is small and meant for hauling salvage, but it's mine."
[MTTS] davetaylor: It's really helpful for us screen reader users on the
rundown, seriously, thanks.
[MTTS] usfolks: Or anyone that can't visually use a starmap for whatever reason.
mtts I can't use the starmap either.
[MTTS] siekanas: I can't use the starmap either.
[MTTS] usfolks: Previously the only ways to get that was to scan each ship, or
to use the starmap and look at the bottom, which meant a lot of stuff to wade
through first. So this makes it a lot easier.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I have never seen so many
blueprints on the market."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has

ship-classes.

know the ship-classes.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yo Rogue."
[MTTS] usfolks: Was that what it was? It just always seemed like a random letter
or symbol to me.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I thought it was a random character too.
mtts No, it isn't.  It actually gave you a hint as to the ship-class.
[MTTS] siekanas: No, it isn't. It actually gave you a hint as to the ship-class.
[MTTS] davetaylor: I always wondered what it was, it seemed random to me.
[MTTS] usfolks: I had no idea. The only thing I'd like better than it saying
League or Fringe is L, F, A, M, or whatever so it was shorter.
[MTTS] usfolks: But that's just because of my own issues that few other players
have.
[General Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "Hello Rogue."
mtts And whenn you look at the rundown from say the DSC terminal, we're going to
have to look at the starmap too to figure out what ship-classes are there so we
can put together an appropriate reesponse.
[MTTS] siekanas: And whenn you look at the rundown from say the DSC terminal,
we're going to have to look at the starmap too to figure out what ship-classes
are there so we can put together an appropriate reesponse.

mtts The SDC terminal. And you can't hit shipc from the terminal inside the
SDC's office.
[MTTS] siekanas: The SDC terminal. And you can't hit shipc from the terminal
inside the SDC's office.
[MTTS] usfolks: OH! Sorry!
[MTTS] Butchulla: This will be cool to see. Thanks for the change, hosts.
Belatedly, thanks for the change related to the shortening of organizations
names that are on station parts. That really makes life a ton easier.
[MTTS] usfolks: Thought it was something client-specific there. My apologies.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green

the two-person flare "Deadly Strike"
It appears to be at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in flaming metallic yellow letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is clean and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. Its landing
struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic
radome on the forward end.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.

[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Luckily the good folks
over at space Vermin command I'm sure will be keeping a close eye on things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "There
are a lot of justifications one can give in order to perform one activity or the
other. If we do decoy beacon drops, it might cut down the Outsider fleet. If we
do RATS nests it will cut down the horde. What most people fail to consider is
the fact that the RATS seem to be able to reproduce at an alarming rate, and
Outsiders have construction vastly beyond ours to the point that we can likely
make no dent whatsoever in either fleet as things currently stand."
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Yes, the SVC ran by?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah,
you're right. Doing nothing certainly can't help, though. But I'm not arguing
against the strike, I'm just miffed that these jerks are presuming to know what

other AEU planets to encourage them to find their exports or deliver their
imports elsewhere?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Eli and
I set up beacons to try to dissuade them from trading in our ports, and I spend
some time in Endymion orbit trying to discourage some transports for a few
hours."

become so repetative that they'll probably stop listening to them like I tend to
pretty much completely ignore any of the greeting messages when I enter into a

[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Unless somethin's changed that
ain't made the news, which I'd love to hear right bout now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa transmits, "I

to show we're serious."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green

[New Phoenix; The Craftsman]
For a shop supposedly catering to craftsmen, this small store is surprisingly
lacking the expected tools of the trade. Instead, the clean, orderly shelves
display a variety of pristine workbenches and toolkits, as well as a license
dispenser on the counter at the back of the room.
You see a trash can here.
You can go out.
i
 You are wearing a soft red heather cotton polo, a pair of blue corduroy jeans,
and a pair of gray canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of
white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain,
a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a
solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer.
You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a flight
control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched
metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a camera bag, a black
engineering tool case, a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side,
and a leather briefcase. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both elbows, both
forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
You are carrying Shule Elemmire's workbench in your right hand.

means."

am, but I might need until midnight, or at least another hour."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "AEU's gotta do this
themselves. Doesn't matter if they strike or not, work or not, where they put
their debris, whatever. If they're serious about stopping Best, they gotta
decide what to do and commit to it. Nobody can force em and Best would only
twist it around on us if we tried."

continue using their parts then? Or let Eli advise me on that."

Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo rubs up against your leg with a quiet
"Mrrp.".

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of
space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer
insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a while, something that could
almost sound like a word emerges from a burst of static.
The computer reports that in-sector beacons are transmitting the following:
UxUR{"(k\d'wEh4LUQS,*wMH7u9^;U:`Vm'5_Nej
This area of space is within the green belt of the nearest star, but there are
no life-bearing planets here. Instead there is merely an odd cluster of space
stations of unknown origin.
The sensor noise is much worse here, with a constant dark, gutteral snarling
sound emanating from the ship's speakers. It almost sounds like a language, but
it's nothing you've ever heard before, and the ship's computer cannot pinpoint a
source.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to League Autonavigating Solar Weather Station in thirty seconds unless

[Starship "Bari Smasher!"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a bari pod.
A high warbling alarm suddenly goes off. Speaking over it, the computer
announces, "Fatal hit received. Occupants must stand by for emergency ejection."
You suddenly float up into the air as the ship's artificial gravity abruptly
switches off, and you feel your hair stand on end as the ship projects an
electromagnetic field around you. Suddenly, every seam of the ship seems to come
apart, exposing you to space. You quickly close your eyes as the vacuum pulls at
your skin and the electromagnetic field tugs you rapidly toward a starship
rescue pod.
[Bari Smasher! Rescue Pod]
You can go nowhere.
The pod simply drifts for a moment as its automatic navigation systems come
online. Then it smoothly maneuvers through the wreckage of the starship and out
into open space.

in general." Rogue Pilot Eli Grey laughs. "From beign altered like that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Are you insulting my
genetics?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It is sleeping."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Like I know if I went
from having human feet to felo feet, that would really throw me off a bit."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Only asking because I
wouldn't want to give it to a felo and then it never stop looking at me with
pure hatred or something like that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "It just rubbed it's head
against my hand, so I think we're good."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Oh ok. Well then
personalized human felo pets for all then."
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "Better than rubbing its human
hand against your head."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey cackles!
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Give it tme."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "It may get there."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I wonder, if you give
it to a hummer would it just start having regular covnersations with you?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "If you wanna find that out.
Go ahead. But if a felo ever starts talking to me. I'm running."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What if its first
words are, "What, you still don't know how to replace your arms with tentacles?
Here, let me show you.""
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe they've been
trying to tell you this whole time."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "New theory."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Doc got genetic material
from Evenia during meeting. All the felo will look like her."
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Uh."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I am calling them Evelo."
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Now I have to train her."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So if I drink the
tonic, will I turn into a felo man?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I mean, it seems legit,
right?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No. It has Evenia's genetic
material in it."
[General Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "That or an
Evenili."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "From what we can tell."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "So then a felo would
have to feed it to me."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "This sounds like some
potent stuff, for sure."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright
Eli, it's looking pretty quiet. I'm going to hit the rack."

in sleep."

Lily exploded earlier."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I have a report on
credits losses regarding a civvie ship destruction, I forgot that that hauler
exploded when they cleared the pod."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh,
yeah. It was Shule, Aldis, and I."

power down your capsule, Con."
[MTTS] Ulias: Fantastic.
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like
we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "After the conversation I've just
had, which yielded zero results, I'm scared to ask but what's going on with Eve
and felo?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It would seem that Doc
managed to get genetic material from her during meeting. Doc's formula alters
felo and gives them human skin, eyes, and feet... that all match Evenia's."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I call then Evelo."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has
received 1,086,176.87 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift
Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in Mir.
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Eh.. oh goodness."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You guys sure it's not
just whoever has petted the felo the most recently or the most or something like
that?"
[General Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "I find this even more
concerning."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was under the
impression that the Doc didn't actually take any samples from her."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Well, Nicolette gave one
tonic and it looked like Evenia."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Dakhal Araegin transmits, "Super fast trip to
777. Only 15 minutes in the rift."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "All you need is strand of
hair."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Well yes..."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "People leave genetic
material all over the place without realizing. Or realizing."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But if it was her felo
and she gave it the tonic, it may not mean that they'll all turn out that way?"
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Eh."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I like my theory."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I suppose odder things
have happened, but if he specifically made a tonic to make them like her
specifically that would be like way up there on the list."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey chuckles.
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Hey, it's not a bad
theory."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Didn't she recently have her arms
replaced?"
[General Communication] Nissi Valdaire transmits, "At least they're not from the
future."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "No, just met with Doc and
got stuff to do it apparently."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "I mean, hopefully do it?"
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Yeah, I doubt even genetics could
make sandwiches from the future look like a pilot."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "It is sort of
unpredictable."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "She might grow tiny noses on
her finger tips or something. That would be a thing."
[General Communication] Aisling the Fox transmits, "Anyway. Time for sleep.
Pleasant dreams of human-skinned felo with human feet. Wonderful."

Evil."

[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I do."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Nicolette, did Eve touch both of
them?"
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Let me guess. You stole yet
another of my felo?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "I got a hummer and gave
it the tonic, but it...suddenly stopped humming."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Aww."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "From the ones on my
transport?"
[General Communication] Nicolette Lawrence transmits, "Something like that."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Well...they're all hummers
on there. I'm sorry my part-me felo stopped humming for you."

mean."

knows what you're talking about. Possibly including you."

I don't remember which fuckin' beacon thing I was supposed to make him.

now."

sort of thing."

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.

A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, the Accord negotiations continue,
and so does our strike. The liaison office has informed me that the negotations
are still on schedule to end during the first week of September. That means we
have two more weeks at most to really show our displeasure and get the citizens
of the Union talking. The strike remains voluntary, but I strongly encourage
everyone to take part. If you're looking for something to do, grab a flight
scanner and head into orbit and watch for trade ships entering our sectors. Try
to reason with them and ask them not to make trades in our space. [15:48 23

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.

suggested they stop doing courier runs while this is going on to deny our ports
goods, but Morris said they couldn't as it would hurt everyone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "I was told
that several pilots have agreed to stop using Union ports in their trade runs.
Civilian pilots I mean. So at least that will help."

could even get them on board for two weeks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Perhaps
later this evening I will poll everyone and ask if they think this is an option
we should pursue."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Getting
the other Alliances to threaten cutting off trade if we pull out, that is."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Or trading runs, that is."

getting the alliances themselves to agree to limit their registered merchants."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If you do
that, don't use the voting machine for it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So like
if we left the accord, League registered merchants would stop running goods to
our ports entirely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "If
that's even possible."
tra 1 Yeah, I'm not sure as they may choose their own trading runs, just like we
canl.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Yeah, I'm not sure as they may choose their own trading runs, just like we
canl."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Well we
can't trade in Mutuality ports, can we?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "So there
must be a way to enforce such a restriction."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Or is
that entirely related to our relations with the Mutuality?"
tra 1 Hmm, I'm not sure. I've never really tried to do trading runs to the
Mutuality.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"Hmm, I'm not sure. I've never really tried to do trading runs to the
Mutuality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Even if they
could just suggest it, it might help. If they force the issue it might cause a
whole other set of problems."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I think
Ather said we couldn't and Dakhal found that we couldn't when he tried."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Agreed,
if we did leave the Accord it would blow up in our face majorly."

"Yeah."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Missions or beacons. Cruiser
preferable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah we can't
trade over there, that's because of us having no diplomatic relations."

[General Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "I could do any."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Has

us in the event that we leave the Accord?"

I'm aware."

wouldn't surprise me, but I haven't heard anything about it yet."
[General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "Yo."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "But folks
don't always share that kind of info."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder
why they're not threatening that? It seems like it would be the easiest muscle
for them to flex."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe
they just don't care."

other Alliances to agree to keep us out of their trade and courier networks, but
not dissolve their non-aggression agreements."
Rogue Pilot Eli Grey says, "I wouldn't want anyone to dissovle relations with
us. Any affirming comment I made was directed towards perhaps asking them to
suggest to their merchants not to trade. But ultimately I think that is up to
whatever merchant guild type thing that their may be."
Patriot Constantine Stone says, "Asking that might be too risky even if it were
possible, though. If we did leave the Accord, we wouldn't actually want trade or
deliveries to stop."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

WHAT IS THE LAW?
For the most part, pilots must follow the same rules as the average citizen.
These rules are mostly what you would expect: don't steal, don't litter, don't
assault people, don't run naked through the streets, and so on. Common sense
applies. Usually, a subsection of civil law written specifically for pilots and
their unique circumstances details how to handle any offenses.
EAOS, AEU, and League have an open system of laws which citizens have full
access to, though of course it often requires a lawyer to interpret them
properly. The Fringe still have many laws on the book from their days as a
parliamentary republic; however, citizens are understood to be under martial law
and loyalty is enforced. In other words, Fringe citizens should not presume to
have the right to free speech, and lack many of what one might be inclined to
call "basic rights."
The Mutuality is even more different and subscribes to the Free Port Doctrine, a
large document that enforces free trade and the right for all ships to seek safe
harbor. While violations of the Free Port Doctrine are taken very seriously, the
Mutuality lacks most of the morality-based laws that other alliances still have
on the books.
VIOLATING THE LAW
Violating the law can have a number of possible effects. Minor offenses are
usually met with fines, generally small by pilot standards. More serious
offenses will usually result in a stay in jail (more on this below). However,
because alliances have an interest in keeping pilots free, active, and making
money, they will usually arrange for any stay behind bars to be relatively
short. Only in very exceptional circumstances will a government press charges
against its own pilots and take them to court, and usually these circumstances
will also result in the pilots losing their licenses.
Fines and stays in jail should not be interpreted as punishments from the staff.
You, via your character, will have made the decision to violate the law, and the
world in which your character lives will react in a sensible manner.
Disobedience should be a conscious choice as part of your character's arc, and
dealing with (or trying to avoid) the resulting punishment should become part of
his or her story. Getting thrown in jail does not necessarily mean that the
staff want you to stop what you're doing (although your actions may begin to not
make sense for a pilot -- more on this below). You can roleplay through bad
times too!
THE NATURE OF PRISON
By interalliance agreement, pilots experience their jail time at Corbin Memorial
Prison, a high-security prison on the airless moon Dure. However, because the
facility is also easily accessed by free pilots, any pilots (or ex-pilots) who
are sentenced to serve time in prison will be moved to another high-security
facility within their alliance. Otherwise, pilots are only in jail at Dure until
their court date, or, far more often, until their government decides to spring
them.
Remember, jail is not a punishment from the staff! To this end, the jail
environment is fairly immersive and certainly more than just a single cell that
you wait within. Corbin Memorial Prison enjoys long hours of prisoner free time,
during which inmates can roam the facility, exercise, eat delicious gruel,
shower, and receive visitors. The jail even allows its inmates to send and
receive mail (after it has been screened, of course). If your character ever
ends up in jail, please feel free to leave your cell and explore the facility.
FURTHER PUNISHMENT
Pilots are often regarded in popular culture as something between ultra-rich
celebrities and roguish scoundrels, and the media loves to see them in trouble.
While the media, legally, cannot lie (except for the tabloids), they are not
obliged to show any pilot in a favorable light. If you've done something wrong,
particularly if you're in a position of leadership, expect it to receive some
attention.
Also, remember that pilots must be psychologically fit to serve their alliance.
If you randomly punch a technician in the face, get sent to jail, then randomly
punch a guard in the face, your government may begin to wonder just what is
wrong with you and whether you can still serve them. This may result in a visit
from a psychologist or, if the behavior persists, there may be no choice but to
revoke your character's pilot license. (Note: You, as the player, will be talked
to by the staff before this happens.) Also, it's important to remain consistent
with your profile -- people are fond of submitting profiles describing
themselves as kind and peace-loving, then they go on to try to knock out the
nearest NPC. This sort of inconsistency may require you to revise your character
concept.
Again, though, violations of the law should be a conscious decision on the part
of you, as the player, in order to tell your character's story. The punishment
that your character receives will then be a sensible response by the world that
he or she inhabits. This should not be confused with the staff punishing you,
the player.
If your character has gotten into trouble and you aren't sure what to do, please
use the SUPPORT command to speak with the staff.

The apartments on new Earth are a bit expensive. There's cheaper ones on the
