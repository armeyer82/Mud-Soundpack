00:30:55 You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in flaming metallic yellow letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is gleaming and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

00:39:45 [Starship "Albatross"; Engineering Room]

00:39:46 The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise is in the photo. She is standing.
She appears to be at Starship "William Dove"; Control Room.
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her abdomen is attractive and punctuated by a cute navel. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her waist-length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled crimson dragon pierces her belly button, a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe, and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a tight colorful cropped top, a colorful and very short skirt, and a pair of adorable knee socks. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple

01:07:59 I see no "hatch" in a leather briefcase.

01:08:05 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:08:05 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

01:13:00 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

01:13:01 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

01:13:03 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

01:13:04 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Anyone salvaging?"

01:13:07 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

01:13:08 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

01:13:13 [General Communication] Damien Alexander transmits, "Yah."

01:13:13 [General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "You!"

01:13:17 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in Providence Station, an AEU scout has jumped in."

01:13:17 The ship is already moving.

01:13:18 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

01:13:19 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Providence Gate. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

01:13:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

01:13:21 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth here, AEU transport heading for us."

01:13:22 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

01:13:22 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I'll leave the transfer alone then."

01:13:24 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

01:13:26 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

01:13:27 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Gate flight control, this is Providence Station, we record an inbound AEU corvette."

01:13:27 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Providence Station in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

01:14:18 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Okay, I'm heading for the Accord now, you need a toll thing and what?"

01:14:18 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:14:19 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

01:14:24 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."

01:14:24 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station here, AEU corvette coming in to dock."

01:14:29 [General Communication] Rogue Romano transmits, "I'm same Emily, accord salvage missions only."

01:14:38 I don't understand that.

01:14:39 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

01:14:40 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:14:41 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

01:16:25 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

01:16:27 Via general sector communication, Lordy, The Phoenix Flies transmits a text-based transmission: "hello"

01:16:31 Get a visual of which ship?

01:16:31 
[1] Lordy, The Phoenix Flies

Enter your selection:

01:16:32 You see a scout here.

01:16:33 "Lordy, The Phoenix Flies" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AY-104" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment, and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

01:16:35 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "beep beep"

01:16:46 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

01:16:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

01:16:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

01:16:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is New Earth, an AEU corvette is about to land."

01:17:01 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

01:17:04 You pull a large lever towards you.

01:17:04 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:11:09 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

02:11:09 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

02:11:15 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

02:11:20 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

02:11:20 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

02:11:30 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

02:11:30 Which sector did you mean?

02:11:30 
[1] Torus Corridor (EAOS)
[2] The Torus (EAOS)

Enter your selection:

02:11:32 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to The Torus. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

02:11:32 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:11:33 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Torus Corridor."

02:11:36 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:11:38 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:11:39 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:11:39 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

02:11:40 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Torus."

02:11:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

02:11:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

02:11:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

02:11:44 The perfect ring of The Torus spins serenely nearby.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to The Torus (Dock Alpha) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

02:11:46 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oops Lizie fell asleep."

02:11:47 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

02:11:49 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.

02:12:02 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident presses a button and brings up the starship's navigation controls.

02:12:02 I don't understand that.

02:12:04 You say, "Oops."

02:12:04 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

02:12:06 You grin.

02:12:07 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

02:12:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Well. Isn't that like. Twenty six billion?"

02:12:20 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins at you.

02:12:32 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

02:12:32 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

02:12:37 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

02:12:37 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

02:12:47 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

02:12:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

02:12:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

02:12:53 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

02:12:53 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

02:35:36 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

02:36:04 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:36:04 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Awesome! Well you'll need 500 industry, 300 combat and 150 Exploraiton. I probably shouldn't have added the Communications Systems override."

02:36:19 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:36:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exploration that is."

02:39:45 [General Communication] Lexie Amarras transmits, "There once was a gorilla furry, who never got himself in a hurry, he'd on her drop boulders, then over his shoulder, he's carry her off with no worries."

02:39:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "When you get so focused on salvaging you don't realize your charge gets to 20%."

02:58:34 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:58:46 You glance at your communicator's screen.

02:58:46 Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, an update on the availability of services and upgrades in Mutuality space -- apparently a level of technology exchange was part of the QSA agreement. The Mutuality has lost access to upgrades they were able to buy from us (they made sure to tell me the ugprades were useless to them anyway, so we likely won't be using them to strike a new bargain), and in turn, we can't buy any from them. This is pretty disappointing to me, and I'm sure to many others, as it means we won't be outfitting new expedition ships any time soon. Hopefully when this Outccord business ends we can turn our attention towards repairing our relationship with the Mutuality. [00:58 28 August 2317 GST]

03:05:54 Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I think that is wrong though the QSA as far as I know didn't include upgrades. That would have been part of a NAP or I don't understand why not the Free Port Doctrine as then what does that cover."

03:43:15 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

12:57:48 Shine the big white glowing felo wanders out.

12:58:35 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

14:17:19 Put Lily on what? There seems to be no such furniture here.

14:17:24 You place Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident on a tiger stripe leather sofa.

14:17:27 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

14:17:32 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Kalina, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

14:17:32 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

14:17:34 You turn to page Twenty-seven.

14:17:36 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "It is a surprise, but it is also good to see you around."

14:17:37 Read what?

14:17:37 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "There's a bit of news to catch up with, if you haven't been keeping up."

14:17:42 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

14:17:58 [General Communication] Hakeem Oiadip transmits, "I have read them but sometimes seems I need a translator."

14:18:33 [General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Beef fed cornstalks?"

14:18:37 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to Capital Ship Drydock. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

14:18:37 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:18:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Sector 11."

14:18:41 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

14:18:43 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

14:18:44 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

14:18:44 A lone outpost glitters in an otherwise nondescript cloud of debris.

14:18:49 The League's legendary shipyards hang motionless in the dark here. Once, the stations would be all but glowing with waste heat as the Intersector Shipbuilding Company rolled out ship after ship. Now the stations are still and darkened, and the ISC is no more.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

14:18:50 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Capital Ship Drydock."

14:42:17 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Subject: Proposal: Edward van Dannikin's escape plan pro...
Author: AEU Pilot Liaison Office
Posted: 07:29 28 August 2317 GST
--
Edward van Dannikin's escape plan proves that the Accord withdrawal negotiations are being carried out in bad faith. If the president's chief negotiator believes that the withdrawal will damage the Union, how can any citizen be expected to support it? Whether Best was ignorant of or complicit in van Dannikin's treachery, his own fitness to lead and his motives in the withdrawal are called into serious question. The civilian pilot corps demands an immediate end to the withdrawal attempts.

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be 'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a special application in character generation.

16:42:23 [Space Station "Tooth & Claw"; Corridor]
This corridor is very humid and unpleasantly bright. Murals decorate almost every available surface, from a rich and colorful nebula near the docking area hatchway to a deep green alien sky with strange flying beasts as you move further down the corridor. Several hatchways are visible, but all seem to be sealed.
You see a small metal grating in the photo.
Beneath the Waves of the Ocean, James Kennedy, Ather Jammoa, Nissi Agnello-Valdaire, Conrad Falkswell, Emma Hughes, and Tabi Canis are in the photo.

16:43:15 [Starship "Fighter Sigma Omega Theta"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. A dais lies at the center of the room, raised several feet into the air with a smooth curve leading down to the floorplates and a slight indent at the mostly flattened top.  Dozens of monitors surround it, split into two separate sections on either side of the dais. There do not appear to be any keyboards or buttons visible, instead a collection of pads rest on either side of the dais.  The entire ceiling appears to be a single light, leaving the room slightly uncomfortably bright.  In a ring around the outer edge of the floor is a mesh-like grating, from beneath which can be heard a slow hiss.  The walls are covered in brightly colored murals of an alien landscape, with several Children of the Sun standing together in similar poses, as if in the middle of fluid motions. Fierce light shines down from the ceiling, and the air hangs heavy with moisture. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a Thrall translator device with a bulky human-made attachment welded to it in the photo.

16:44:55 The navigation systems are nonfunctional until their power is restored.

16:44:56 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

16:44:57 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

16:44:58 I don't understand that.

16:45:13 You begin the launch sequence.

16:45:18 A launch trajectory is located.

16:45:18 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

16:45:28 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

16:46:16 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to New Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

16:46:17 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:46:18 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

16:46:20 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:46:22 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:46:23 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station here, an AEU corvette has jumped in."

16:46:24 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

16:46:25 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to New Earth Orbit."

16:46:26 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

16:46:28 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

16:46:29 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Providence Station flight control here, an AEU corvette is outbound."

16:46:47 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

16:46:48 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

16:46:52 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land at the city of New Phoenix."

16:46:53 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in New Earth, AEU corvette on an incoming trajectory.  Clear the pad."

16:47:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

16:47:07 You pull a large lever towards you.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot.

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

Lasers are most often an AEU pilot's favorite weapon. This is mostly due to the fact that most AEU ships get nice bonuses for our laser turrets, which makes using them more worthwhile than using something like chainguns. In some instances, the lasers also get a really good hull bonus which make them more useful than heavy launchers if you have a strong enough laser upgrade. The downside to using lasers however, is that they really drain the combat grid. So you'll want to find a laser turret that has a good balance between damage, hull bonus and combat energy grid. There is also a time issue, too. Some of the heavier lasers pack a nice punch, but have a five second firing time. This could theoretically hamper your ability to destroy ships in a timely manner. Note: the potential damage points information in the above stats do not reflect the additional bonus damage points available in some AEU ships.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

19:07:25 [AEU | 4: Sector Status] AEU Scooping Solar Temporary Station at Olivia's Pearl Orbit is now on emergency power.

19:10:50 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth flight control here, AEU transport heading up."

19:11:09 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth to New Earth Orbit flight control, an AEU transport has jumped out."

19:11:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

19:11:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

19:11:13 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

19:11:19 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

19:11:19 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "This is flight control in New Earth, AEU corvette heading for space."

19:11:29 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

AEU transport "Registered Merchant 297" departed to EAOS sector Torus Corridor (Alpha-1) approximately 5 minutes ago.

19:16:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. One jump to Telex Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

19:16:35 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

19:16:38 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

19:16:40 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

19:16:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

19:16:43 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth here, we record an outbound AEU corvette."

19:16:44 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in Telex here, an AEU corvette has jumped in."
The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Telex in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

19:16:46 Via general sector communication, Telex transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

19:17:48 There are no other ships in the sector.

19:19:18 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 297" has launched from Telex.

19:19:18 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Telex here, AEU transport heading for space."

19:19:20 Via general sector communication, this ship transmits a text-based transmission: "Outccord needs to be stopped. Avoid trading in AEU space."

19:19:36 The computer reports that the two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 297" has jumped out of the sector.

19:20:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Telex flight control here, AEU corvette coming in to land."

19:21:02 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

19:48:00 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

19:48:01 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.

21:33:13 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:33:14 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on a dark green leather captain's chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on a dark green leather captain's chair.)

21:33:18 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

21:33:19 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

21:33:20 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

21:33:25 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

21:33:25 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.
A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "New Earth Orbit flight control, this is New Earth, we have an AEU corvette launch."

21:33:35 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

21:33:35 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Endymion Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

21:33:36 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:33:36 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Cheyanne's Star."

21:33:39 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

21:33:42 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

21:33:42 A voice emanating from a flight control scanner announces, "Flight control in New Earth here, we record an outbound AEU corvette."

21:33:43 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.
A single star shines brightly in the dark here, the light strangely comforting. The ship's sensors indicate that the star's spectrum is nearly identical to Sol's.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

21:33:43 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Endymion Orbit."

The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Endymion in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

21:33:50 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

21:33:51 Via general sector communication, Endymion transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

21:33:52 There are no other ships in the sector.

22:26:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:26:20 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on a dark green leather captain's chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
