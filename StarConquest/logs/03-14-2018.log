01:20 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

01:20 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

Subject: Our ridiculous lives
Author: Constantine Stone
Posted: 18:57 13 March 2318 GST

Pilots,
 
I won't be at the meeting Saturday, so I thought I'd jot some things down about the current predicament we're in for people to think about. At the recent League meeting Kim and I attended, a couple things were made clear to me:
 
1. The League pilots voted twice to not allow us on their ships and not crew on our ships. Any League pilot who does these things in spite of the vote is seen as a scab breaking a strike.
 
2. The League is really pissed off about Best saying that the citizens of the Mutuality aren't human.
 
3. Many of the League pilots feel that we don't do enough to oppose Best, and that we either embrace him or tacitly enable him.
 
You'll notice I wrote nothing about stations, because I don't really care about stations. There are maybe 6 of us that are active, and among those 6 the number of pilots who actually need the extra money from stations is probably 0-1. I don't think we should make any decisions based on our inclusion on stations.
 
That said, if I could correct some of these things, I would. In a perfect world, we would still be in the Accord, but that ship has sailed and isn't coming back. Personally, I view the Steel Phoenix as being important to the Union's defense now that the Accord doesn't provide that defense, so I have no problem supporting it. Some League pilots have expressed views suggesting to me that they believe the Steel Phoenix is some kind of threat to unregs. This seems idiotic and nonsensical to me, but we don't really talk about these things -- if any of you feel like we're wrong to support the Steel Phoenix, I'd like to hear about it. 
 
Also in a perfect world, Best wouldn't make disparaging, inflammatory comments about people he hasn't met, or persecute unregs in general. This is something we have no control over -- my view is that we voted him into office, this was a mistake, and we'll likely have to live with it for the next three years (barring events outside of our control -- Hyperion voter registration ledger, anyone? what happened to that news story, and where are the ledgers?).
 
I'll admit I've done nothing to oppose Best lately. Since the crashes last year, I've been working hard on earning the money to pay off the debt I owe to New Phoenix, and not on much else. I also personally feel that while Best has said and done things that are distasteful to me, I've done worse things. It isn't just me, though. My perception is that none of us are doing anything to oppose Best currently. I get that there aren't many of us and we have varying levels of activity; I understand this, but I doubt these things mitigate the perception that we don't care or actively support the government.
 
So what's to be done? If I were writing a wish list, I'd wish for Best to place some percentage of Steel Phoenix forces at the disposal of the Accord, as a way of contributing a token force to the common defense of humanity without giving the Accord control over all our defense spending. I'd also wish for Best to drop his persecution of unregs and stop trying to deport the ones within Union space (did that ever happen? another news story that disintegrated). These things probably won't happen, though, as the government never listens to us and apparently has no incentive to.
 
Interestingly, at this recent meeting, a few league pilots expressed interest in meeting with us to come up with peaceful and legal (I stress) ways to oppose the administration. I thought this was interesting because in the past none of them have shown any interest in helping us (and indeed, many of them still do not). I don't know how fruitful such a meeting would be, however, as I think we've well established that protests and strikes coming from six guys are pretty toothless. I have mixed feelings about attending a meeting like this. I think it's encouraging that other people want to help, but don't forget that fixing point 3 in my above list will never do anything about point 2. The League takes its cues from the Mutuality for whatever reason, and likely won't amend relations with us while our government openly persecutes unregs.
 
So those are my thoughts on the current political climate. I'm
01:30  sorry I'll miss the meeting. If anyone has thoughts about these things, please post them, I'd love to read them.
 
To the government stooges reading this, come at me, I guess. I think we're way past hiding our displeasure.

Greetings,
First, please keep any and all messages and exchanges over the AEU Channels we engage in which pertains to the AEU as confidential. I do not want anything I am about to share to be exchanged with anyone who is not an AEU pilot. Thank you for respecting this request as well/
I am not certain that I will be available to attend the meeting Saturday, however, I will if possible.
Here are my own responses to Constantine's statements along with my own thoughts.
While I did want to attend the meeting yesterday, I couldn't for personal reasons. Still, I didn't consider that it would yield much progress because you see, the League are the true separatists in all of this. If they truly wanted to protest what the AEU Government is doing along with what they mis-perceive that AEU pilots are not doing, then they would engage with us.
Constantine states:  1. The League pilots voted twice to not allow us on their ships and not crew on our ships. Any League pilot who does these things in spite of the vote is seen as a scab breaking a strike.
I already knew about the League's unwillingness to work with AEU pilots who they want to punish rather than our government. Yet the League believes it's ok to allow the Merry Band to pervade known space. Until recently, they didn't seem to take issue with another Alliance's government whose government is a dictatorship so it's rather hypocritical. but it goes without saying that they aren't following a very rational line here.
You see, if they truly wanted to punish the AEU government, they would give us cause to earn their currency and increase the proffitability of other Alliances rather than for us to independently engage in our own enterprise. So herein is a contradiction of rationale on the part of League pilots.
next Constantine states:  2. The League is really pissed off about Best saying that the citizens of the Mutuality aren't human.
I agree with the League on this aspect and it is perfectly clear that none of us agree on this point as I have considered Mutuality to be as human as anyone.
So thereagain, the League just want to drum up excuses to point fingers ... to hold us accountable for what we absolutely cannot control.
Constantine then states:  3. Many of the League pilots feel that we don't do enough to oppose Best, and that we either embrace him or tacitly enable him.
We protested, I am not a Phoenix Dissident for tacidly agreeing with the AEU Government either. I personally paid for Message beacons expressing my own opposition to Outcord. I attended the meeting across the Skim to attempt to negotiate our assurance that we would demand of the AEU government that they would agree not to attack the Mutuality nor invade their space again. Consequently
01:33 , no conflicts have occurred since the initial incident. Here's just another childish and mis-conceived justification on the part of the League to blame us merely because of their typical 'because we can' mentality. Notwithstanding that I am certain that all of us would not support any attacks on the Mutuality if they were to ever reoccur. I for one do feel a huge sense of frustration and I reluctantly concede to feeling more powerless than I want to ever admit. I'm still willing to do whatever it takes though to do what we can but a handful of us can't effect the necessary changes. It takes more than a handful of pilots who citizens disrespect in the first place, to cause the necessary level of force to effect change.
Concerning Temporary Space stations, I disagree with Constantine and I would say that this is likely due to his lack of personal experiences and knowledge concerning Temporary Space Stations which isn't any fault of his. we need them but we don't need to participate with other Alliances with the exception that Cats can buy all of the highest Temporary Space Station Modules. However, there was a time when all organizations couldn't and they put together the best possible station configurations with what they were capable to provide. Everyone grew and survived quite nicely. We shall manage very well without the best that Credits can buy. We need these stations to maintain funds in our organizations particularly to support Cruisers for defending not only humanity but perhaps our own lot. We need stations to support our newer pilots so that they can earn a bit more from their work to enable them to grow their own financial resources so that they will become more empowered and able to work with us and our allies. Stations also do detractfrom the AEU government merely because very little of the income generated is realized by the AEU government. So if we had no stations, when we performed work where the income received is paid out directly through a Spaceport, Artifact Research facility, for Beacon drops not sponsored by a Battle Scanner and so on, the AEU government profits by taking out a significant portion in taxes which isn't the case through the utilization of Temporary Space Stations. Therefore, if I didn't have two Cruisers to support along with other Combat-ready Starships and the ability to support up to 4 Cruisers currently, through SEAS, I would still support the continued operation of income producing Temporary Space Stations as a measure to deflect income from the AEU government itself. Additionally all funds retained in an organizations' balance are in EAOS currency and not AEU currency.
I really don't personally earn much from Temporary Space Stations but there are other aspects which I have described above which are of far greater benefit to us as pilots and which are far-reaching towards our ability to support our c
01:33 ommitment to defend humanity.
I regret it that we could not continue to be a part of the Accord. That breech is shameful which isn't a strong enough word to describe my true feelings. Whenever I encounter peacekeepers, I always greet them and I have also freed several from interdicters launched by the Merry Band and will continue to help to defend them when the need arises
While i am not personally convinced that the Union through The Steel Phoenix Command is capable of defending itself against the likely magnitude of Outsider attacks and occupation experienced in the past, I will support it as it's all that we have in our defense to the extent that it is.
The League's claim is another one of their baseless claims. There's no rational evidence to support that Steel phoenix exists for any other purpose other than to replace what was lost due to the breech with the Accord.
I am personally conflicted concerning renewed relations with the League. I cannot and will not tolerate their willingness to allow pirate activity merely to be able to selfishly gain for themselves in the way of more powerful Exploration Technology. If we, notwithstanding the worst government we've ever had, were to engage in any negotiations, as long as they support pirate activity, I will absolutely not support any relations with the league in this respect.
Having said what i have, I personally do want to get along with others from all Alliances. I do
01:33  not engage anyone in debates over these mattters and I am willing to work alongside those who don't want to work with us purely because I want to be respectful and behave in an amicable and professional manner. I would ask that we all consider this approach regardless of our own inner conflict about these issues as well.
I am not able to work as much as I once could so my time to independently wage any sort of personal effort to resist the worst administration ever! is limited. Still, I am willing to do whatever it takes with whatever I have. As for these next three years, I certainly don't look forward to them. I am however skeptical though, that any major seachange we could manage still will never be adequate enough for some whose mind-set is 'because we can'.
Although I don't hold Unregs in the same regard as the AEU government, this stems from prior to the current government. The old resentment of those who severed their ties and departed with untold claims of large sums of resources is somewhat legitimate I would surmise. However, the irony here is that we all are descendants from those who were willing to depart from their countries back on Old Earth albeit mush was supported through efforts to explore and to discover. I personally believe that whatever those individuals who departed left with was theirs and theirs alone to utilize in whichever manner they so chose. I will always admire those with the spirit to explore and to take on adventure of any magnitude. So, I personally respect and admire the spirit and courage of those who are so-called Unregs. I abhor the statements made and I wish I could have been present to go after whomever attacked Pierre and any of those present who were treated in such a horrible manner. I don't believe violent actions are acceptable or a productive means to prove any point except abject stupidity.
So what's to be done according to Constantine? I support his wish for Best to place some percentage of Steel Phoenix forces at the disposal of the Accord, as a way of contributing a token force to the common defense of humanity without giving the Accord control over all our defense spending.
Unfortunately, this is highly unlikely given the desire or the ability for the Union to effect competent negotiation to resolve differences. They will likely never concede to work cooperatively with the Accord.
I demand! not just wish that Best ceases his persecution of unregs and stop trying to deport the ones within Union space
As Constantine states, at this recent meeting, a few league pilots expressed interest in meeting with us to come up with peaceful and legal (I stress) ways to oppose the administration. This is certainly interesting because in the past none of them have shown any interest in helping us (and indeed, many of them still do not). This is due in part to the sheep mentality amongst many league who don't think for themselves and base their decisions doggedly upon what a few dictate to them.
I agree too, The League takes its cues from the Mutuality for whatever reason, and likely won't amend relations with us while our government openly persecutes unregs.
I fore the most part, support Constantine's sentaments with the exceptions I have cited. I am not certain that we can accomplish a lot in a meeting which we all don't already agree upon. I'm not into politicking either as this is not the time to try to seekout cudos for oneself.
I have never nor ever will hide my displeasure with the behavior and inhumane actions of the AEU government. so if that is the perception of others who want to pride themselves upon punishing the AEU, then they are seriously mistaken!
Cordially,
Lily Kaise

02:39  to support Cruisers for defending not only humanity but perhaps our own lot. We need stations to support our newer pilots so that they can earn a bit more from their work to enable them to grow their own financial resources so that they will become more empowered and able to work with us and our allies. Stations also do detractfrom the AEU government merely because very little of the income generated is realized by the AEU government. So if we had no stations, when we performed work where the income received is paid out directly through a Spaceport, Artifact Research facility, for Beacon drops not sponsored by a Battle Scanner and so on, the AEU government profits by taking out a significant portion in taxes which isn't the case through the utilization of Temporary Space Stations. Therefore, if I didn't have two Cruisers to support along with other Combat-ready Starships and the ability to support up to 4 Cruisers currently, through SEAS, I would still support the continued operation of income producing Temporary Space Stations as a measure to deflect income from the AEU government itself. Additionally all funds retained in an organizations' balance are in EAOS currency and not AEU currency.
I really don't personally earn much from Temporary Space Stations but there are other aspects which I have described above which are of far greater benefit to us as pilots and which are far-reaching towards our ability to support our c
02:39 ommitment to defend humanity.
I regret it that we could not continue to be a part of the Accord. That breech is shameful which isn't a strong enough word to describe my true feelings. Whenever I encounter peacekeepers, I always greet them and I have also freed several from interdicters launched by the Merry Band and will continue to help to defend them when the need arises
While i am not personally convinced that the Union through The Steel Phoenix Command is capable of defending itself against the likely magnitude of Outsider attacks and occupation experienced in the past, I will support it as it's all that we have in our defense to the extent that it is.
The League's claim is another one of their baseless claims. There's no rational evidence to support that Steel phoenix exists for any other purpose other than to replace what was lost due to the breech with the Accord.
I am personally conflicted concerning renewed relations with the League. I cannot and will not tolerate their willingness to allow pirate activity merely to be able to selfishly gain for themselves in the way of more powerful Exploration Technology. If we, notwithstanding the worst government we've ever had, were to engage in any negotiations, as long as they support pirate activity, I will absolutely not support any relations with the league in this respect.
Having said what i have, I personally do want to get along with others from all Alliances. I do
02:39  not engage anyone in debates over these mattters and I am willing to work alongside those who don't want to work with us purely because I want to be respectful and behave in an amicable and professional manner. I would ask that we all consider this approach regardless of our own inner conflict about these issues as well.
I am not able to work as much as I once could so my time to independently wage any sort of personal effort to resist the worst administration ever! is limited. Still, I am willing to do whatever it takes with whatever I have. As for these next three years, I certainly don't look forward to them. I am however skeptical though, that any major seachange we could manage still will never be adequate enough for some whose mind-set is 'because we can'.
Although I don't hold Unregs in the same regard as the AEU government, this stems from prior to the current government. The old resentment of those who severed their ties and departed with untold claims of large sums of resources is somewhat legitimate I would surmise. However, the irony here is that we all are descendants from those who were willing to depart from their countries back on Old Earth albeit mush was supported through efforts to explore and to discover. I personally believe that whatever those individuals who departed left with was theirs and theirs alone to utilize in whichever manner they so chose. I will always admire those with the spirit to explore and to take on adventure of any magnitude. So, I personally respect and admire the spirit and courage of those who are so-called Unregs. I abhor the statements made and I wish I could have been present to go after whomever attacked Pierre and any of those present who were treated in such a horrible manner. I don't believe violent actions are acceptable or a productive means to prove any point except abject stupidity.
So what's to be done according to Constantine? I support his wish for Best to place some percentage of Steel Phoenix forces at the disposal of the Accord, as a way of contributing a token force to the common defense of humanity without giving the Accord control over all our defense spending.
Unfortunately, this is highly unlikely given the desire or the ability for the Union to effect competent negotiation to resolve differences. They will likely never concede to work cooperatively with the Accord.
I demand! not just wish that Best ceases his persecution of unregs and stop trying to deport the ones within Union space
As Constantine states, at this recent meeting, a few league pilots expressed interest in meeting with us to come up with peaceful and legal (I stress) ways to oppose the administration. This is certainly interesting because in the past none of them have shown any interest in helping us (and indeed, many of them still do not). This is due in part to the sheep mentality amongst many league who don't think for themselves and base their decisions doggedly upon what a few dictate to them.
I agree too, The League takes its cues from the Mutuality for whatever reason, and likely won't amend relations with us while our government openly persecutes unregs.
I fore the most part, support Constantine's sentaments with the exceptions I have cited. I am not certain that we can accomplish a lot in a meeting which we all don't already agree upon. I'm not into politicking either as this is not the time to try to seekout cudos for oneself.
I have never nor ever will hide my displeasure with the behavior and inhumane actions of the AEU government. so if that is the perception of others who want to pride themselves upon punishing the AEU, then they are seriously mistaken!
Cordially,
Lily Kaise

Subject: Re: Our ridiculous lives
--
Greetings,
For what it's worth, I'll throw my two credits worth of thoughts in here as well. As with Lily, please keep my thoughts and writings strictly within the AEU.
Regarding the League's vote not to allow AEU pilots on League ships: I honestly wonder what the point of that is. What is it exactly they wish to accomplish by banning AEU pilots from their ships. Is it going to help us oppose Best? Of course not. Is it going to not allow us to fly? Of course not. Is it going to help defend humanity against the real enemy, namely the Outsiders? Of course not. So, what is the purpose of such an action and what good do they expect to come from it?
Personally, I believe it's just another way for them to create drama and exert their power over other pilots. It's the League who controls what everyone else does on temporary space stations and there was no mutual vote to elect them into that office. They just assumed it as a matter of principle, because they could and nobody opposed them.
Regarding Best's statements regarding unregs. It seems that AEU and Mutuality have not had good relations for quite a number of years now. This is nothing new and while I disagree one hundred percent with Best's statement, it is what he said and not how the pilot corps feels as a whole. So, punishing the pilot corps, being such a small body of people, for something that the government said, isn't going to make a lot of difference either. Again, there's not any good reason to do that except to fabricate excuses to stir up drama.
Third: many of us did protest Best and Outcoord and while I do not regret any actions I took to take a stand against it, most of us felt powerless despite everything we did. I know that some of the League pilots expressed that AEU pilots should have just quit the pilot corps as a way to stand up against Best and his actions. A couple of them even told me that they would have used violence and would have happily gone to prison in protest to Best's administration. Since September of last year, we have lost AEU pilots who chose to protest by turning in their pilot's license. Has it honestly made a difference? ?No, it has not. Violence was used as a way to protest the AEU government, not by us pilots, but by others and yet it made no difference. 
So, League pilots think it's better to sacrifice one's career then be there to help protect humanity? Really? Some of us had to work very hard and/or make big sacrifices to be where we are as civilian pilots. I do not, nor would I suggest anyone to, take resigning from the pilot corps as a trivial decision. It is one that we should take very seriously. Despite my disagreements with the AEU government, I signed up to be a civilian pilot in order to, among other things, defend humanity.
Regarding temporary stations: I have disagreed with the way we've handled temporary space stations for a while now. The League pilots have assumed control over who participates on which stations. Perhaps I missed it, but when was the vote that took place to put someone in charge? The League are supposed to be a democracy and it seems they've voted on many issues, yet I somehow missed the one in which we had an opportunity to vote who we wanted to be in charge of  coordinating temporary space stations. In nearly the same breath that League pilots told Lily that nobody reports to her except her organization members, they said, "I'm going to wield the hammer of power and say ...". Again, why is it ok for the League to "wield the hammer of power" and yet accuse us of trying to take control? Seriously? Someone please enlighten me, because obviously I'm missing something here.
Personally, I think temporary space stations help everyone and if we have to build our own, we certainly can. It'd be nice to work with other people who will work professionally and fair with everyone, but if that can't happen, then I think we should do what we need to.
Obviously, I have my personal differences with pilots of other alliances, but in all of this, one of the most important ideas to keep in mind is that the purpose of the Accord and the different alliances is that we all have strengths and weaknesses and we may not like the people flying with us and they may not like us, but in the end, who's side are we on? If there 
02:39 is another major outsider invasion, how is any of these disagreements and drama going to help protect the ones we love and ultimately humanity? If the Outsiders were to attack us tomorrow, they'd be attacking a people divided in strife and conflict. We as the human race would be so much easier to conquer in such a turmoil state. All four alliances have played their part and had their individual roles during the resistance and in the fight against the Outsiders. So, who is the real enemy here? Right now, I believe it's ourselves.
I have not been able to work very much as of late either due to reasons of my own and I am more than willing to do what I can to help the alliance. However, I protested against Outcoord, I have participated in various inter-alliance activities, and I have performed my duties as a civilian pilot to the best of my ability and I will continue to do those things. One thing I refuse to do is to surrender my civilian pilot's license in protest of the AEU government. Pilot resignations as a means of protest will only reinforce Best's actions and will weaken the AEU civilian pilot corps even further.
I will do my best to be at the meeting, but I cannot guarantee I will be there. So for what it's worth, those are my thoughts.
Regards,
Shule Elemmire

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

21:58 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: The Torus (Dock Alpha).

21:58 Via general sector communication, The Torus transmits, "Greetings, Deadly Strike! Welcome to The Torus!"

21:58 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

21:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Interesting, I see we still have access to the Luna Tracking Array."

21:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh we do?"

21:58 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah it's on Old Frontier."

21:58 The computer reports that the two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 277" has launched from The Torus (Dock Alpha).

21:59 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

21:59 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

21:59 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Deadly Strike. The EAOS welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

21:59 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

21:59 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Oh ok."

21:59 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

21:59 You pull a large lever towards you.

21:59 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

21:59 The computer sounds a notification indicating that the ship has been fully charged.

21:59 Your ship 'Deadly Strike' has been automatically moved into a garage.

22:00 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps quietly, indicating that it has unread notices.

22:06 You glance at your communicator's screen.

22:06 There are four board posts.

22:06 You'll have to stand up first.

22:06 You'll have to stand up first.

22:06 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

22:06 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a small hot beverage dispenser, and an insulated purple sleeping bag here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are lying on an insulated purple sleeping bag.)

22:06 You stand up from an insulated purple sleeping bag.

22:06 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

22:06 You can go out and enter into the ship.

22:06 You exit the ship.

22:06 [The Torus; Garage]
You see a large number of stored starships here.
You can go up.

22:06 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

22:06 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a small mystic purple bioplastic crate here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

22:06 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]

22:06 You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a dingling bell, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and violet aquatic life and coral rocks, a festive holiday tree made entirely of sparkling ice decorated with an ornamental rendering of Icy the Snowfish's Holiday Ice Castle o' Wonders and a gold ornament etched with the year 2317, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a small dusky pink trash bin, Magellan the arachnoid security robot, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.

22:07 I see no "sneakers" here.

22:07 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]

22:07 You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, and a small mystic purple bioplastic crate here.

22:07 I can't find "sofa."

22:07 You sit down on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

22:09 A long amber soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles rears up suddenly from behind a plastic wrecked EAOS Defender and wraps its tentacles around it as if trying to drag it into the deep.

22:10 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh this new pilot's Cargo Hauler is powered up on the Landing pad. Guess we need to let him or her kow that we need to power down while landed."

22:12 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

22:12 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Know that is."

22:13 You glance at your communicator's screen.

22:13 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! I received a call from Melinda Michaels from the League Alliance. She has reports that AEU pilots are hauling their Asteroids to the other Asteroid processor which where no AEU organizations are contributors in Alpha 285. Personally, I would consider it to be your own decision as to whose Asteroid processing station you wish to haul to. However, if you would prefer to earn AEU Currency and to give the AEU organizations credit for the work performed by the processor, then while hauling asteroids out in the Alpha 285 Asteroid Cluster, please be certain to choose the AEU Asteroid processor. Fly safely and fight hard on the ground! [21:10 14 March 2318 GST]

22:19 A dark gray egg wiggles for a moment, then a small thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws emerges!

22:23 A long yellow soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.

22:38 'lily' could refer to more than one person. Please be more specific.

22:39 You can't go that way.

22:47 A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in OOC/Comedy.

22:47 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "One repair suit for Tesla? Preferably Tier 3 or 4."

22:47 [Tactical Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Can do."

22:48 [Tactical Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Give me 2 minutes to swap suits."

22:50 [Tactical Communication] Blake Madison transmits, "Headed over now."

22:50 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Hmmm. Need a sec to sort Teslamods."

22:52 Lily Kaise does not seem to have an active communicator.

22:53 A long orange soft-bodied creature with many claw-tipped tentacles abruptly flings itself at the side of the tank, its tentacles tapping at the glass, then it withdraws.
