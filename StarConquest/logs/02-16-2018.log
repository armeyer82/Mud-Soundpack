-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, and a pair of tan suede clogs here.

19:53 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a small purple ball containing a

20:07 [Starship "Starlight Express"; Control Room]

20:07 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a glossy pearl gray ceramic felo chow bowl and Mekensie the humanoid service robot here.

20:08 The bowl is still almost entirely full.

20:08 a sleeping atrophied orange soldier felo

20:08 This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears almost vulpine. It is small in size and covered in short, striped orange fur, possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, curved white claws, visible only when not retracted. A black, arrow nose sits below a pair of clear indigo eyes with vertical pupils. It appears to be sleeping.

20:08 A sleeping atrophied orange soldier felo suddenly sneezes, bolting upright. It blinks, then gradually sinks back to the ground and falls asleep again.

20:10 The four-person light carrier "Es Ma Dernière Rose Bleue" is loaded onto an automated flatbed and slowly moved into a large garage.

20:10 Katina Faye asks, "Care to come with me, or shal I I go with you?"

20:10 You hug Katina Faye.

20:10 You notice a point of light outside slowly start to grow larger.  A starship must be about to dock.

20:10 You hold Katina Faye's hand, taking her into your group.

20:10 The two-person medium transport "Registered Merchant 598" touches down smoothly on the surface of the docking bay.

20:11 You smile at Katina Faye.

20:11 Katina Faye says to you, "A bit has happend."

20:11 You ask, "Like?"

20:11 Katina Faye stifles a smile, and mutters, "A bit."

20:11 You say, "Please, do tell."

20:12 Katina says to you, "Remember my resentment towards Melinda and how I wasn't kepping my distance with people?"

20:12 You nod.

20:13 Katina Faye says, "Urr how I was doing that."

20:13 You say, "I do remember."

20:14 Katina Faye says, "Well some weeks ago, she called wanting to know what was up with me for maybe the second and third time. So I finally took her out on drinks and told her how things were with me and why I closed up to her and stuff."

20:14 You say, "Ah ok."

20:14 You ask, "And what did she say?"

20:16 Katina Faye says, "Well I told her all the things that pissed me off about her. And why I closed up. But right um, when I mentioned her not telling me where the heading to the hall of pain was, she claimed that she probably turned off her comm durring that arguement over general."

20:16 Katina Faye says, "Or else she would have told me the heading to the hall of pain."

20:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"

20:16 Katina Faye says, "Then she said if I wanted to go on trips or run off, to tell her."

20:17 Katina Faye says, "And she'd take me."

20:17 Katina Faye says, "But I said bull, because."

20:17 You say, "Ah ok."

20:17 Katina Faye says, "She's the one that told me to my face in front of everybody to not do exactly what she was offering me."

20:17 Katina Faye giggles.

20:18 Katina Faye says, "But she said yes okay she said that, but that she was stupid and was very pannicked about me, she said things that she probably dind't mean."

20:18 You say, "Hah, sounds like something she'd say."

20:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey Shule."

20:20 Katina Faye says, "But the night ended with me drunk as hell, and us agreeing to work things out again. I said okay we can try but it doesn't mean that I'll open up to the rest of her people either. And she said that's fine."

20:20 Katina Faye says, "So the next day."

20:20 Katina Faye says, "Strangely."

20:20 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hey there."

20:21 Katina Faye says, "Morris wanted to apologize too about some things."

20:21 Shule nods to  you to continue.

20:21 Katina says to you, "How do you think that went?"

20:21 Katina averts her gaze, her warm hazel eyes laughing in quiet amusement.

20:22 Katina Faye says, "Oh and I miss my hair, I didn't know it would have to be this short for the hairstyle, but it's okay it will grow back."

20:22 Katina Faye blushes. "Sorry random note."

20:22 Katina returns her gaze to you and ponders for a moment.

20:22 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Do you have a ship with a scoop I could borrow?"

20:23 Katina Faye says, "Well, the first part of the apology conversation with Morris went alright."

20:23 You exclaim, "Awww, you look fine!"

20:23 You nod.

20:24 Katina Faye says, "But I think he was expecting me to open up, but when I did things that indicated I still had my guard up, he got nippy, and the conversation turned into an arguement which shouldn't be surprising with Morris."

20:24 I don't understand that.

20:24 You chuckle. "Nope, it's not surprising."

20:24 Katina Faye says, "I wasn't pissed until he walked out on me and started being dramatic and bring our private conversation on to the league channel."

20:24 You sigh.

20:24 You say, "Again, not surprising."

20:25 You say, "He's sure gotten errogant."

20:25 Katina Faye says, "Oh but man did that roil up my temper."

20:25 You say, "I bet1."

20:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "I don't sorry. It can't land."

20:25 Katina Faye says, "Before, I would just let people push me around, and be too shy or scared to stand up for myself. So he got something he wasn't expecting."

20:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ah, okay."

20:26 You say, "Heh."

20:26 You grin at Katina Faye. "Good for you."

20:26 Katina Faye says, "And surprisingly nobody ganged up on me, they sort of ganged up on him instead."

20:26 Katina Faye giggles.

20:26 You laugh.

20:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Why can't it land?"

20:26 You say, "So serves him right."

20:26 Katina Faye says, "He spit words at me through the comm, and was being dramatic, I spit words right back."

20:26 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "It's a tactical platform."

20:26 I don't see that here.

20:26 Katina Faye says, "But later when we went down the the hall of pain for that artifacting thing."

20:27 You nod.

20:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Those can't land?"

20:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Not until you detach the ships attached to it."

20:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."

20:27 Katina Faye says, "He just glossed things over with me by apologizing about walking out on me. But not, mind you, for bringing our personal conversation on to the league channel but whatever."

20:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Where do you keep it?"

20:27 You exclaim, "Wow!"

20:28 Katina Faye says, "So that's one bit that's happend..the other bits."

20:28 You ask, "Oh, there's more?"

20:28 You grin.

20:28 Katina Faye says, "Of course. Katina is not a boring individual."

20:28 You laugh.

20:28 Katina bites her lip and pouts.

20:28 You hug Katina Faye.

20:28 Katina Faye smiles at you.

20:28 Katina Faye says, "Lets see."

20:28 Katina Faye says, "When I dated michael, everybody suspected that he had something going on with Jada."

20:29 You say, "Right."

20:29 You say, "I remember thaqt."

20:29 You say, "That."

20:29 Katina Faye says, "But me being good hearted and trusting, was like "Pfff, whatever, he'd never do that.""

20:29 You ask, "Let me guess, he was with Jada?"

20:30 Katina Faye says, "And he convinced me that they were good friends for the longest time, so...I dunno. Guess I bit the bate."

20:30 You say, "Awwww."

20:30 Katina Faye says, "But now that we're not together, I thought he'd move on. In fact I was very sure of it, that it wouldn't take him long at all."

20:30 You say, "Right."

20:30 Katina Faye says, "And it hasn't, it's just the person he supposedly has a thing going on with is what caught me off guard."

20:31 You ask, "Is it Jada?"

20:32 Katina Faye says, "Which is Jada. And he says that she is keeping it on the down low, until she talks to Caleb about it. So right now, if they're doing anything more than friendly she's basically cheating."

20:33 Katina Faye says, "So I guess I was right to break up with Michael because one of the reasons being that I felt like I couldn't trust him to be loyal. But it just makes me wonder, what did they do when they were doing things together, especially when he was upset with me, or I upset at him. I wouldn't and didn't suspect athing."

20:33 You exclaim, "Wow!"

20:33 Katina Faye says, "When we were together that is."

20:34 You exclaim, "I'm so sorry!"

20:34 Katina Faye shrugs.

20:34 Katina Faye says, "Here's the other piece to my love status."

20:34 Katina Faye smirks.

20:34 You chuckle.

20:34 Katina Faye says, "So Ather and I spoke some weeks back."

20:34 You nod.

20:35 Katina Faye says, "And I found out that he still had feelings for me, and that whatever happened to me with the rift, did have affect on him."

20:35 Katina Faye says, "But."

20:35 You say, "Ah ok."

20:35 Katina Faye says, "We couldn't be together because his view is that the government decides if we should have arelationship or not."

20:36 You nod. "I see."

20:36 Katina Faye says, "And since there is discourse between the league and AEU, well we can't be together."

20:36 You say, "Right."

20:36 Katina says to you, "Everybody has their opinion, but do you think that's right or wrong?"

20:37 You say, "I personally don't agree with him. I think if you two want to be together and are willing to deal with the consequences, so be it."

20:37 Katina nods softly.

20:37 You say, "But that's my personal opinion."

20:38 Katina Faye says, "It is the same as my other friends."

20:38 You say, "But, having said that."

20:38 You say, "I understand where he's coming from."

20:38 Katina Faye says, "Which is Joel and Mel. I'd tell ali about it, but he'd just roll his eyes inwardly and tell me to fuck Ather and that I'm stupid to waste my time on him."

20:38 Katina Faye says, "Because Ali's very blunt, but he cares."

20:38 You say, "Lily refuses to date people from other alliances for a similar reason."

20:39 You nod to Katina Faye.

20:39 Katina Faye says, "I don't understand the logic behind that reason."

20:40 You say, "If war broke out between League and AEU, it'd be very difficult for you two to keep a relationship and neither of you could be very loyal to your alliance."

20:40 Katina Faye says, "It makes me feel worthless to him."

20:40 You say to Katina, "I understand."

20:40 Katina Faye says, "But about Ali, he'd probably just say those things because he's pissed about it inside, but is too macho to be nice about it."

20:40 Katina Faye giggles.

20:40 You chuckle.

20:41 Katina Faye says, "But yes, Ather's views on relationships makes me feel worthless to him, but I..."

20:41 You say, "I've been romanticlaly interested in League pilots, but haven't dated them for the same reason. If war broke out, dating would be tough."

20:41 Katina Faye says, "I still care for him no matter what, I still love him unconditionally and that sort of loves endures."

20:42 You nod to Katina Faye. "I know and I'm sorry, but he's really trying to protect your heart."

20:42 Katina Faye says, "But we'll never be together though and so I guess I'm working on trying to let go."

20:42 You nod.

20:42 You say, "I know it's tough."

20:43 You say, "Like I said, I've had romantic interests in some League pilots and still would love to get involved with some of them. If wI wasn't claimed or if... never mind."

20:43 Katina Faye says, "He says because of the way our government is and the pirate thing, he will encourage his alliance mates to not have a pact with the league if he can help it. So before he was wanting to work something out as far as government goes, but now he doesn't want to work anthing out with us."

20:43 You say, "Anyways, I really shouldn't because of the fact that there is tention between the two alliances."

20:44 You nod.

20:44 Katina says to you, "Please sir."

20:45 Katina's hazel eyes grow pleading for a brief moment as she gazes at you, opening her mouth to try and say her words.

20:45 You ask, "Please what?"

20:48 Shule waits patiently.

20:48 Katina says to you, "That is Ather's view on what iniciates his relationships, but even though I respect his decisions, I would...It's just cruel, so please don't have the same mind set as he does. In some relm of possibility, if you were in the situation that I am with Ather, you'd make the girl feel very heartbroken and inferior. I do not think it is the right mind set to be in. But forgive me if that offends. When you have feelings for someone, you're supposed to appreciate them for their heart, not their government status."

20:48 Katina Faye says, "It might as well be saying."

20:48 You say, "Oh I very much agree with you."

20:48 Katina Faye says, "I like you because you are sickly rich, so screw you if you ever get poor."

20:48 Katina averts her gaze.

20:49 Katina lets out a soft anxst sigh.

20:49 You say, "I was just sharing his point of view. I disagree with it."

20:49 Katina nods softly.

20:49 Katina Faye sits down on an overstuffed dark green chair.

20:49 Katina Faye says, "Mel and Kani."

20:49 Katina Faye says, "I am happy for them."

20:50 Katina Faye says, "The value each other the way I wish Ather valued me."

20:50 You say, "Like I said, if certain conditions were different, I'd probably get involved or would want to get involved with pilots from other alliances, but I'm claimed and..."

20:50 Katina Faye says, "They do."

20:50 I don't see that here.

20:50 You nod to Katina Faye.

20:50 Katina says to you, "You're claimed and what?"

20:51 [Tactical Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Morningstar beacons?"

20:52 Turning slightly red, Shule says, "And... I'm claimed."

20:52 Katina flashes you a playful but benign smile and ruffles your hair.

20:52 Katina Faye says, "Finishing up Mel and Kani subject, yeah. Their government is apart, but still, they don't let that get in the way of their relationship."

20:53 You nod to Katina Faye.

20:53 You say, OOCly, "I need a few minutes. I'll be back."

20:53 Katina Faye says, OOCly, "Kay."

20:54 Keying her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, Katina Faye gasps. "Outch I felt that."

20:54 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "What plant was it?"

20:54 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Ah."

20:56 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Tier 3/4 nest anyone?"

20:57 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "Need a repair and a support."

20:58 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Aww so cute. The men doing the gardening."

20:58 [Tactical Communication] Tanny Hill transmits, "One more?"

20:58 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Oof."

21:10 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Is this slogan lame? "Reach for the stars?""

21:11 You smile at Katina Faye.

21:12 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "But it was figuratively speaking. And okie."

21:12 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "And am I a rebel for wishing Ali was founder due to him habeing active next to one that isn't?"

21:12 Katina Faye smiles at you.

21:13 You say, "So, I was just saying that if I wasn't claimed and Lily were open to certain things then... yeah."

21:13 You blush.

21:13 Katina says to you, "And to your statement. You are claimed and happily so. I hope."

21:13 Katina says to you, "Ah."

21:13 You exclaim, "Oh I am!"

21:13 Katina Faye says, "Got it."

21:13 Katina Faye smiles.

21:13 "Woe." Katina whispers, stifling a laugh.

21:13 You exclaim, "But I won't cheat on her. That's not right!"

21:13 Katina Faye says, "I made Shule blush."

21:14 You chuckle.

21:14 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Damn the crickets."

21:14 Katina says to you, "Has Mel ever made you blush?"

21:14 You say, "Yes."

21:14 Katina Faye pouts.

21:14 You say, "Lily has on occasion."

21:14 You laugh.

21:15 You say to Katina, "Awww, it's ok.?Lily's n known me for a long time."

21:15 Katina says to you, "Because we're grown people, and because I'm bored."

21:15 Katina says to you, "Nah I was pouting about mel making you blush."

21:16 You exclaim, "Oh, not Mel. She doesn't make me blush!"

21:16 You laugh.

21:16 Katina says to you, "In the relm of impossible things do to your relationship status, humor me and tell me which pilots you'd be interested in?"

21:16 You laugh.

21:16 You ask, "Why?"

21:16 Katina says to you, "Oh but I asked if she made you blush and you said yes I'm pretty sure."

21:17 You say, "Oh, I thought you were asking has anyone ever made me blush."

21:17 You say, "IO miss heard your question."

21:17 Katina Faye says, "Well I gave one reason, I'm bored. The other reason now is because I'm curious now."

21:17 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"

21:18 You say, "Well, one pilot isn't around now-a-days and she already knows. So, Seneca."

21:18 Katina says to you, "And okay that's a bonus for me then. You are the second guy I have made blush without trying."

21:18 Katina Faye says, "Mel can make everyone blush."

21:18 Katina Faye says, "I will knock off my competitave aura now."

21:18 You say, "'But Seneca is interested only in women."

21:19 I don't understand that.

21:19 Katina says to you, "Outch."

21:19 You grin at Katina Faye.

21:19 You say, "Yeah, just my luck."

21:19 You say, "And the other..."

21:19 Katina stifles a giggle.

21:19 You say, "Ummm."

21:20 Katina Faye says, "I feel that way when a girl tells me she likes me. But not because I wish she did or anything. It just feels awkward."

21:20 Katina Faye says, "So, "Just my luck indeed.""

21:20 You say, "Not that I'd eer have a chance of course, but.... You."

21:20 Say to whom?

21:20 You say to Katina, "I understand."

21:21 You say to Katina, "Don't worry. I won't do anything with you."

21:21 Katina says to you, "Okay, trust you."

21:21 Katina says to you, "But that's flattering to know none the less."

21:21 You say, "I won't even flirt."

21:21 You say, "I promise."

21:21 You smile.

21:22 Katina's posture relaxes and she returns your smile, her warm hazel eyes gentle and benign.

21:22 You say, "But I'll never chat on Lily or leave her."

21:22 You say, "Cheat on her that is."

21:22 "Oh come on." You grin at Katina Faye. "Have I even flirted with you once?"

21:22 Katina Faye says, "Which is the way it should be with the one you are with. I'll never understand open ended relationships."

21:23 Katina says to you, "Well hmm."

21:23 Katina bites her lip to tame her playful smirk.

21:23 Katina says to you, "When I was a cadet."

21:23 You sigh. "I've lived the wild side before, not an open relationship, but..."

21:23 You exclaim, "I wasn't flirting!"

21:23 I don't understand that.

21:24 Katina says to you, "No no. The closed ended not wild, and actually cherishing each other and only each other, is the way to go."

21:24 Katina Faye says, "Relationship speaking."

21:24 You nod to Katina Faye.

21:24 You say, "I did it to please my significant other at the time, but it's really not what I prefer."

21:24 Katina says to you, "You're a good man. Honest and loyal. Stay that way."

21:25 Katina Faye says, "Right I've vented, I'll share some cheery news I guess."

21:25 You say to Katina, "Ha, that's what you think!"

21:25 Katina Faye says, "There's this guy."

21:25 Katina lets out a soft tinkling laugh.

21:25 You say, "That I'm a good man. I'm really not that good."

21:25 "Oh, who is it now?" You grin at Katina Faye.

21:25 Katina says to you, "What I know of you, you are."

21:26 Katina says to you, "It's so dumb. I'd stay loyal to Ather even when I wasn't his."

21:26 You say, "I try, but everyone makes mistakes and I've made quite a few of my own."

21:27 Katina says to you, "Well of course. I'm talking to you, a human, I hope."

21:27 Katina Faye smirks.

21:27 Katina Faye says, "Humans are not perfect."

21:27 You grin.

21:27 You say, "Last time I checked I'm human."

21:27 You grin at Katina Faye.

21:27 Katina Faye says, "Anyways, I wouldn't put myself on the market, or go out on dates with anyone."

21:28 You nod to Katina Faye.

21:28 Katina Faye says, "And now, I'll go out on dates, but still I won't go in a relationship, but I'll go out on dates, so at least that's something? I'm trying to let go and follow Mel's advice."

21:29 You smile at Katina Faye.

21:29 You say, "I'm glad."

21:29 Katina Faye says, "I've had strong feelings for Ather still, for 4 months after he let me go, and I'm just cursing myself at how hard it is to get over him."

21:30 Katina Faye says, "I don't understand why I feel this way."

21:30 You say, "It can happen when we care about someone very deeply."

21:31 Katina Faye says, "Well, I wish I was amuned to romance. It would be better to deal with heartbreak, because there wouldn't be any."

21:31 Katina Faye giggles.

21:32 Katina Faye says, "I could care for someone as friends, and brothers and sisters, and it might be grand, the thought of it anyways in my head."

21:33 You say, "Maybe, but then you'd never know the joy of being with someone that you truly love and truly loves you. Lily didn't want to date at all when she became a pilot. Now, she would give anything to remain with me."

21:33 Katina says to you, "I'm just afraid to go on a relationship with someone because I don't want to get my heart broken like I have with Ather. Yet I want to feel valued and treasured so it's a bit hard to say no when somebody wants to take me out on a date."

21:33 I don't see that here.

21:33 You nod to Katina Faye. "I understand."

21:34 You say to Katina, "Remember, Lily told me in no uncertain terms that she wasn't looking for a relationship when I first flirted with her."

21:35 "Yeah." Katina says glumly. "I'm sure it will all be okay some day. Only time will tell."

21:36 You say, "It will be."

21:36 You say to Katina, "You're a good person and good things will come to you."

21:37 Katina Faye says, "The past is our ghost because it haunts us. The future is our hope, because it is something to look forward to. And the present is a gift, because it is a reminder of our existence, and that we've made it through to the next day."

21:37 You say, "Me on the other hand, I'm headed to wherever evil people go to when they die."

21:37 I don't understand that.

21:38 Katina says to you, "Oh blah. Don't be so pessimistic about yourself."

21:38 Katina Faye asks, "What have you done that makes you feel that way?"

21:38 Katina Faye asks, "Have you murdered anyone? Abused anyone?"

21:39 You say to Katina, "Just being realistic is all. I've broken my fair share of hearts in the past."

21:39 Katina Faye asks, "Deliberately?"

21:39 Katina Faye asks, "Did you get sadistic pleasure out of it?"

21:40 You say to Katina, "Whether or not it was deliberate or not, it still hurt people."

21:40 Katina Faye shrugs. "Shame is alright, but shame is our caution and a sign that we've learned from a mistake we've made or lesson or another."

21:41 Katina Faye says, "It shouldn't be a taunt to ourselves to bring us down."

21:43 Katina says to you, "Okay, you've made mistakes, I've made mistakes. But chin up a little, the person that you make mistakes with isn't perfect either. We're humans and we can't run from our flaws. I think when we learn from our mistakes and try to do better about it, then that is what gives it a bit of justice. Or do you not think I make any sense, and am most likely rambling?"

21:43 Katina laughs quietly.

21:44 Katina Faye says, "You seem sorry about your mistakes. I think that is enough to keep you from going to the evil place that people might end up wherever. That place is for those that have no regret for their wicked deeds."

21:44 You say, "Hopefully."

21:44 You smile at Katina Faye.

21:45 Katina Faye says, "Or. Maybe when I die, I'll turn in to an alien."

21:45 Katina Faye smirks.

21:45 You laugh.

21:45 Katina says to you, "I'm sorry, just trying to lighten you up a bit."

21:45 Katina smiles warmly at you.

21:45 You exclaim, "Well, to some species in the universe, we probably do look like aliens!"

21:46 You grin at Katina Faye.

21:46 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

21:46 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
Katina Faye is sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.
You can go east, southeast, and out.
(You are sitting on an overstuffed dark green chair.)

21:46 Katina Faye says, "Yes we probably look like squichy cylinders, with strands that fail about if they touch us or pick us up."

21:46 Katina playfully wiggles her fingers.

21:46 You laugh.

21:46 You stand up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

21:46 You sit down.

21:47 Katina Faye arches an eyebrow.

21:47 Katina says to you, "Why did you move from the chair?"

21:47 You smile at Katina Faye. "I didn't want to make you feel crowded on it."

21:47 Katina says to you, "Did I offend you? Cause I'm not aware of it if I did."

21:47 You grin.

21:48 Katina Faye says, "Oh okay."

21:48 You smile at Katina Faye. "You didn't."

21:48 Katina stretches her arms out. "These are the strands they are looking at." she says. "But I don't feel like flailing them.

21:48 I don't understand that.

21:48 You laugh at Katina Faye.

21:49 Katina Faye glances down at her watch momentarily.

21:49 Katina Faye asks, "Oh did you see the new food dispensers that are out in stores now?"

21:50 Katina Faye says, "Food dispensers for humans that is, not felo or pets."

21:50 Katina Faye says, "There's one for cake..."

21:50 Katina counts on her fingers.

21:50 Katina Faye says, "Pizza."

21:50 Katina Faye says, "And other things."

21:50 You say, "Oh, I didn't."

21:50 Katina Faye says, "It's sold on the other side of skim."

21:50 You say, "I haven't been around much."

21:51 Katina Faye says, "I will buy Lily and you them."

21:51 You say, "Awww, thanks. Let us know how much they are and we can reimburse you."

21:51 Katina Faye asks, "Who's mailbox should I send it to?"

21:52 Katina Faye says, "And no need, they are not that much."

21:52 Katina Faye says into her lustrous Autumn gold metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Erik?"

21:53 You say, "You can send it to Lily's. She checks her mailboxes more often."

21:58 You say to Katina, "Anyways, I need to go for a while. I'll be back later."

21:58 Katina says to you, "Alright."

21:58 Katina Faye stands up from an overstuffed dark green chair.

21:58 You stand up.

21:58 You hug Katina Faye.

21:58 Katina says to you, "Thanks for talking with me."

21:58 Katina says to you, "Take care."

21:58 Katina Faye hugs you.

21:58 You say to Katina, "Of course! You too!"

21:58 Katina Faye waves.

21:58 Katina Faye walks out.

You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.
