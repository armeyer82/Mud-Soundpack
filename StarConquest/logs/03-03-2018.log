-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

00:37 [Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it here.
You can go out.

00:46 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hi Love, just sitting here in my ship currently as I say was just taking care of administrative stuff."

00:47 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]

00:47 The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.

00:48 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:48 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:48 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:48 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Deadly Strike, you are given undock clearance under the AEU-EAOS non-aggression pact."

00:48 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:48 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:48 The computer says, "Destination selected. Three jumps to The Glittering Belt. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:48 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:48 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Providence Gate."

00:49 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:49 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:49 Providence Station shines brightly in the dark, one of the few stations that bothers to illuminate its outer hull. The gleaming hull of the station is bathed with bright white floodlights.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:49 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Telex Orbit."

00:49 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:49 This asteroid belt is unusually close to its star, and the slowly rotating asteroids glitter brightly in the sunlight.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Space Station Delta in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:49 Via general sector communication, Space Station Delta transmits, "Hello there, Deadly Strike! Welcome to home space!"

00:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If they ask you to help maintain the accelerators or the beacons to that station, say yes to them, and do whatever they want within reason. Since we will be using that area too."

00:49 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yeah that's only fair."

00:49 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:49 You begin the docking sequence.

00:49 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

00:49 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:49 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Airlock]

00:49 You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:49 You exit the ship.

00:51 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:52 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:52 You begin the docking sequence.

00:52 You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space structure.

00:52 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

00:52 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:52 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:10 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Space Market.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

15:10 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

15:10 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

15:10 You begin the launch sequence.

15:10 A launch trajectory is located.

15:10 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

15:11 I don't understand that.
Try this instead:  min

15:11 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

15:14 --
Hey Love,
I'm rather ... baffled! when you spoke to me over the Org channel, i was in the midst of taking care of the rare business that I do over on New Earth. I went to check my office. Then, I kept getting these notifications on my Comm about large monitary transfers. I'm surprised you didn't see those as well. Ather has been dealing with others lately to obtain Golden tael and various other items. If a transaction is 100 million or more now, it has to be approved by one of us who have a liaison position. Then Ather was discussing with Jacob where to asteroid haul and 285 and we had a discussion, concerning the next AEU BAS and things. So I'm so sorry that I missed you and since we were speaking on the Org channel I didn't think you wanted to talk by phone too? Anyway, Ather hadn't added me back to Invader's Warehouse and it seems he didn't have access to SEAS so I reset his access. All this to say that I took care of a number of items , went to look in on the Range office as I have to build both the Salvage and BAS today and now I'll be going out to 285 and establishing an AEU Asteroid Processor as well. When I mentioned to Ather that we would have to access the accelerators established by the other organizations which could create issues, Ather said he would be willing to share with them so as it happens, we were just connecting on aspects which are for the benefit of AEU pilots as we had the opportunity to do so. Then
15:14  I came back to Dove and you were not there ??? I tried to locate your Flare and I'm Baffled as to why you are somewhere that I am unable to locate it as I went to all AEU Sectors as I wanted to see you Love.
I sure pray that you are all right?
I'll be back in Dove until i have to go out and put stations together when I wake up.
I love you,
Lily

15:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh I can go over there. In a few hours, the Salvage station will go offline but I think I'll just put that and the new BAS up at same time. I did put up the Asteroid processor. I'm sure we'll see fireworks from League but they don't own 285."

15:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No they don't own it, but they sure act like they do sometimes."

15:28 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh no kidding!"

15:29 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"

15:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I think I will put a salvage station in 777 and know what, Kim almost suggest I do that but we'll sponsor one first and if starseekers wants in or maybe if it can work on a large battery, I'll use one of the batteries we share and that way Starseekers gets some action without investing in a more advanced processor."

15:31 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Ok, sounds like a plan."

15:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Oh I can go over there. In a few hours, the Salvage station will go offline but I think I'll just put that and the new BAS up at same time. I did put up the Asteroid processor. I'm sure we'll see fireworks from League but they don't own 285o."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.

                         It was the apocalypse.

But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.

 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.

You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.

                   It is time to take to the stars.

15:39 [Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, and a small hot beverage dispenser here.
Lily Kaise is Sitting on your lap with her arms around you.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

17:51 Notice from the Ground Squad Leader: Greetings! Invaders, SEAS and Starseekers have established an AEU only Asteroid Processing station in Asteroid Alpha 285. To go to this area, jump to Belt of Orion, then press the TRAVEL button from the Starship's Control Room and 285. Hunt for an asteroid and be careful to HAUL to the AEU Asteroid station. When you want to leave the area, in order to receive payout, after hauling the last asteroid, exit your Asteroid Hauler and go up into the Control Room of the Asteroid Processing station and press the TRANSFER button. Next, return to your Asteroid Hauler and launch. Finally from your Starship's Control Room, press the TRAVEL button and 286 for Home Alpha 286. This will autotravel your Asteroid Hauler to one Sector West of Belt of Orion and if you do nothing after entering this sector, your starship will autonavigate back to Belt of Orion where you may then fly to another location of your chosing. Be safe! And fight hard on the ground! [13:16  3 March 2318 GST]

Enter your destination:
[Type a line of input or `@abort' to abort the command.]

18:10 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Frontier Processor.

18:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

18:10 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

18:10 The ship's computer automatically requests docking clearance.

18:10 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Hello, Deadly Strike. We read your AEU transponder. You are cleared to land."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship moves toward a space station.

18:10 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of the space station's local artificial gravity.

18:10 You pull a large lever towards you.

18:10 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

18:10 You peer out...

[Old Frontier Processor; Docking Bay]
The hydraulics for the airlocks lining the long side of this spacious docking bay run quietly and efficiently, transporting each newly docked ship to an individual berth outlined with square white lights above and below. The nearly seamless walls and floor are constructed of light gray metal with signs and hatchways accented in dark green. Though few people are about, it seems a very well built and maintained station.
The two-person flare "Deadly Strike" is landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine here.
You can go north, northeast, south, northwest, and up.

18:11 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

18:12 You glance at your communicator's screen.
