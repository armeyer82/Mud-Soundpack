Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a white four
poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings
with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a
hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on
it, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a small oval turquoise
rattan table with a glass top, and a large periwinkle bed pillow here.
You can go out.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

New Minor Changes:
-----
LOAD and UNLOAD commands on landing pads have been added to manually load and
unload battlesuits. The ship must be present on the pad, though ships in another
ship's docking bay will also be found. Manually loaded battlesuits must be
manually unloaded later; they will not automatically transfer, which would
rather defeat the purpose.

You chuckle. "Well, the vents aren't really that pretty to be in."
Lily Kaise says, "I've taken lots of folks before so yes pay out is rather poor
but it's the benefit of using the Processor which is the most important and
hopefully just trying our best to keep plugging on this project."
nod lily
You nod to Lily Kaise.
Casen nods. "Truthfully the payoff of being able to use the processor is
primarily what I'm after," she says. "That and the sense of keeping the Bari
under control rather than just letting it all run rampant, I suppose."
Lily Kaise says, "Although tier isn't that important. It is said that one of
these days the queen will emerge and that will be rather... challenging."

You nod to Casen Thale.
[Tactical Communication] Hawthorn Dunn transmits, "Okay just us four."
Casen Thale says, "While we're waiting on Hawthorn I'm going to take a look at
the EAOS suit and make sure it's ready. If he strongly prefers one way or the
other I'd just as soon be prepared."
Casen Thale walks out.
Lily says to an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond,
"Casen, this is probably the last Vent cleansing we'll do for awhile. I guess
you have heard about an expedition leaving tomorrow. We'll be gone for a few
weeks. Is there anything we can do for you before we depart which will help you
along?"
Lily Kaise laughs.

You nod to Lily Kaise.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Casen is bringing eaos."
Lily Kaise says, "Yes but she is like a tier 1."
Casen Thale just arrived.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "I was under the impression that tier wasn't an issue."
Lily Kaise says, "It should be at least a 3."
'She's going to go through energy like my ex's used to go through boyfriends. I
mean...
You say, "She's going to go through energy like my ex's used to go through
boyfriends. I mean..."
Hawthorn Dunn asks, "Can we put her in AEu and you both bring damage?"
Lily says to Casen Thale, "What is your tier for aEU?"
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Oh, hey there. Didn't see you come in."
Casen Thale says, "One. I'm about forty points from 1.5. Presently I only have
regeneration and minor repars, as far as all that goes."
A nearby pilot lectures at length about why having diplomatic relations with
other alliances is stupid.
"Hello.'" Casen Thale smiles at Hawthorn Dunn.
Lily says to Hawthorn, "Please ask Clari to come unless she just isn't
available?"
Hawthorn Dunn says into his metachannel FTL communicator and watch, "Hey
Clarina, they're saying they still need you, because they need more firepower.
If it's no. We can regroup when they have more available."
'I can switch back to EAOs.
You say, "I can switch back to EAOs."
Lily says to Hawthorn, "I've led many of these and so I agree that ideally 4 is
good but 5 is fine."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "I don't want to spend two hours on this honestly."
Lily Kaise says, "Me either so please ask Clari."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "I did."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "If she can't come. We'll regroup when there is a better
line up of suits."
Lily says to Casen, "What tier is your AEU?"
Lily Kaise smiles.
Hawthorn Dunn says, "She said one."
-lily Think she said 1
You say to Lily, "Think she said 1."
Lily Kaise says, "Oh."
Hawthorn Dunn says, "Regen and minor repairs."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah that's pretty tough."
Lily Kaise says, "Sometimes you need more than minor rep."
Casen Thale says, "I'll be 1.5 sooner or later, but coming by ground points is a
bit more difficult than the others, I've found."
'AEu should be at least tier 3 in  my opinion.
You say, "AEu should be at least tier 3 in my opinion."
Lily Kaise nods and smiles.
Lily Kaise nods to you.

while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins

once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's
torso, while the pilot's arms and legs extend into a framework of hydraulics and
cables with some protective plating. A minidrone applicator is attached to the
left wrist, a hose leading to a bulky device on the back of the suit. A laser
attachment is mounted to the right wrist.

amazing to see what gets sucked up by an average station's ventilation system
while cycling its air. Endless bits of paper and trash, children's toys, coins
-- how? currency has been electronic for hundreds of years! -- objects that may
once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.
You can go east and south.

once have been food, gloves, socks, condoms... you name it, it's probably in
here somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You can go south and out.

The Torus's large garage is mostly empty but is surely as clean as it was on the

metal of the deck, and the walls and ceiling are spotlessly clean. No ordinary
lights provide llumination here, beyond the work lanterns of the mechanics who
come in and out seeing after the starships, but rather the gray metal of the
structure seems to glow of its own accord.

[Starship "Blackwing Yalobusha"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Thick bundles of wiring stream in
from several locations on the walls, carrying information from every part of the
ship to this one location. A few cables rest on the ground, haphazardly placed
as if the focus was on utility over sparsity. There is only a small, reinforced
viewport visible on the airlock hatch, allowing you to view outside the ship.

power control and alert status are controlled here. A few secondary boards have
been haphazardly placed near the primary display, but they seem to possess only
the barest functionality. The room is surprisingly spacious, though the random
placement of equipment makes it difficult for anyone but the pilot to truly be
comfortable here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status.

a larger, torpedo-like fish darts into the middle of them.
Large underwater vents come into view, spewing clouds of dark, superheated
minerals into the ocean. The mounds are covered with colorful corals.

Clarina Taylor
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and six inches tall and
has tan skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval, lightly-freckled, and lovely, with a button nose and dimpled chin.
Her lips are faintly upturned and rose-pink and occasionally part to reveal a
set of white teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are hazel and
almond-shaped. Her shoulder-length, curly hair is auburn and hanging in a thick,
fluffy mass over her shoulders. She has neatly trimmed clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a blue knitted cap, a light red utilitarian jumpsuit with a FCI
patch on the shoulder, a wristwatch with a slim black leather band, and a pair
of sturdy bright red walking boots. She is also wearing an elegant gold ring
inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, a gold touch einrophone in a white
reinforced plastic phone holster, and a black silk handbag embroidered with
brightly hued dragons. Her face, both eyes, left wrist, and both hands are left
uncovered.

Constantine Stone asks, "If we needed to, could we have Pierre's ship run with
most systems cut so it could pull on the way home?"
Constantine Stone says, "Or are both drives needed."
Constantine Stone says, "I'm assuming we're pulling him now."
Melinda Michaels says, "We are."
Melinda Michaels says, "I'd guess both ships have systems cut because we are
both losing charge. So, it wouldn't really matter."

cut the lower our signal becomes."

Melinda Michaels says, "You want to drop your signature so trim to say 50 for

Melinda Michaels says, "Then fly in a different direction than where you were
spotted heading."

Melinda Michaels says, "Yup."

try something like northwest so as to get the fastest escape with lower trim."

basic info I just gave you, I didn't properly figure out the scans."

Melinda Michaels says, "So I turned and the scans kept going louder with ships
coming closer, so I turned."
Melinda Michaels says, "No this was some time ago."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh, okay."
Melinda Michaels says, "So pick your heading and stick with it."
Constantine Stone asks, "What do you mean by scans?"
Melinda Michaels says, "Long range scans."
Constantine Stone says, "Oh, ha! Tech I'm totally unfamiliar with."
Constantine Stone says, "Okay."
Melinda Michaels says, "When they kept coming closer, I turned."
Melinda Michaels says, "I screwed up."
Melinda Michaels says, "But came home and happily got the correct information."
Melinda Michaels says, "So."
Constantine Stone asks, "So you would just pick a heading and stick with it
until they lose interest?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah. Gotta pick your direction and commit to it! Cuz
you're in a bit of a race."
Melinda Michaels says, "Yes."
Constantine Stone nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "It's called learning from your mistakes."
Melinda Michaels smiles.
Constantine Stone says, "So you mean you were wise to the fact that they were
following you while you were in the rift."
Nissi Valdaire says, "They go to where they think you were going when you
dropped off their scan, as in when you reduced your signature."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Constantine Stone says, "Ah, okay."

You nod.
Constantine Stone says, "I didn't realize long-range scanners worked in the
rift."
Nissi Valdaire says, "When they don't find you there, they head back toward the
actual location you dropped off their scan."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Nissi Valdaire says, "So your goal is to be far enough away from your original
location that they won't see you by the time they get there."

Melinda Michaels says, "I had to fly a slow ass Galleon against a rapid and some
ass warpers. I think there may have been a chainer but don't recall."
Melinda Michaels says, "They hit me right away when we got pulled out of the
rift but, otherwise, I flew okay."
Constantine Stone says, "Hmm."
Constantine Stone says, "I guess I better have a look around in a bit so I know
where everything is in case of an incident."
'Good idea.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."
You say, "Good idea."

Melinda Michaels says, "Part of my problem was, we were all first timers and I
had everyone telling me what to do while I was trying to do it and watch them
getting closer."
Melinda Michaels says, "Everyone had different ideas."

Melinda Michaels says, "Plus we don't want them tracking us to our destination."
The voice of Evenia Callseah comes tinnily over the linked rift comm, saying,
"So stealthy, in fact, we don't even notice it passing by."
Constantine Stone asks, "True. When do we decide our attempts to run have failed
and give up and fight? If they don't seem to be fooled by us reducing our
signature?"
Constantine Stone asks, "Or would you try running a few times before resorting
to fight in these ships?"
Constantine Stone asks, "Or do they yank us out of the rift somehow, forcing our
hand?"
Melinda Michaels says, "I think Gonzo got away with them passing light-cycles
from him."
Melinda Michaels says, "We'll get yanked out if they get close enough."
Constantine Stone says, "Hmm, okay."
Hawthorn Dunn ambles in from the south.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I think they'd probably change headings again if they spot
you... then you open up the trim and run for a bit while you power stuff up."
Constantine Stone says, "Right."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "Oh."

Melinda Michaels says, "So when I figured we'd need to fight this is what I
did."
Constantine Stone asks, "Oh, you guys felt that too?"
"I...mean it feels like.... like yunno what I mean, right... like," Hawthorn
coughs then flushes. "Uh. Yeah."
Constantine Stone says, "I didn't want to say anything."
Melinda Michaels says, "With the available crew awake, I had an engineer and two
gunners on the Galleon with me. Then I picked the two best fighter pilots we had
awake to launch the moment we exited the rift."
Melinda Michaels says, "And yeah, it's the sexy scene."
Melinda Michaels laughs.

much."
