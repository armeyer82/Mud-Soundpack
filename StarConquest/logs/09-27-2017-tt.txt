Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

    * Welcome to Star Conquest! *
[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated
cooler, a letter, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, and a pair of gray canvas sneakers here.

[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Come on, we can reach our performance goals if we try!"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey groans. "How's everyone doing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Not bad. Yourself?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Bad dreams man, bad dreams... But I'm otherwise alright."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "You too, huh? Tough break."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Want to do something?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not yet, I'm still waking up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Not sleeping well.. I think I might actually doze a bit longer."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Eli, will you and Stone be doing the Security missions?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm still not, no. I just can't bring myself to clomp around my homeworld in a war machine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Understandable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Surprised the withdrawl hasn't finished already."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What, withdrawal?"
A Tardick lizard named Asteria flicks its tongue out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The withdrawl from the Accord of Free Worlds."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's what all the striking and the protesting was about."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I was thinking. Because the strike is over.. we can still protest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "You can, but I can't. That was part of my agreement."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The agreement only pertains to me though, not sure if constantine's was exactly the same or not."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm still allowed to have my opinion of course, as the liaison stated, this is not the Fringe."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Unless Best comes forward with a plan of action, that is thoroughly detailed, and explaining in detail his reasons for leaving the Accord.
I'll protest it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Hey guys."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I've been listening, just doing some other stuff."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The reasons that have been given are to remove restrictions and regulations placed on us by the Accord, I don't know what their plan is for
afterwards, I don't think anyone does."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am thinking... an Effigy. good idea?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was told I couldn't call for strikes or violent demonstrations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Ms Richard said nothing to me that led me to believe I couldn't peacefully protest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I'm sure I could likely join one, but I can't start one. She told me I had to cease any calls to actions, especially violent ones."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Effigies are neither violent demonstrations or strikes. It's just a..... form of protest."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Actually, I think Effigies are a form of peacefull protesting."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly east.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Anyways... I just realised that the Flitter has more Grid, then the Fighters.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I didn't know that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "How much more?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I really should behave myself, if I ever hope to become a full pilot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "About 100."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The fighter has 350.. and the flitter has 450."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was thinking earlier today that there might have been other ways to show them that we needed the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "It would have been great if we could have arranged ride-alongs of some kind."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "With liaison officers."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Maybe we still can."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Though the withdrawal will likely be completed in the next three days."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Still can. It's neither striking, nor violent protests."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But, pleading for them to reconsider."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "There just might not be time enough for the information to get up the chain to Rebane quickly enough. Still, it might be worth showing the
government the value of the Accord, even after we've left."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "The accord should just outright refuse the withdrawl."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Can't hurt to ry, but I doubt that anyone will come. Pleading to reconsider privately was how this whole ting got started and they not only ignored
it, but released a headline that said we agreed with it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "This whole ting has been an escalation. It started off very official."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah, it seems so long ago that Mr. Lambeth told us the first step should be a non-binding resolution."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I am sure it will become self evident after the AEU leaves the Accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I wonder what the second step was supposed to be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No idea."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I almost forget that you were there for that first meeting Constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "When accord vessels don't come to our sectors to assist fighting off Alien threats.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We all expected the government to just tell us that the opinion was appreciated but they were moving forward anyways, but we didn't even get that
much.. then I ended up releasing the minutes of the meeting to the press, and we've just escalted over and over from there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Oh brother."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, and it lead to what we did the other day. I was being pressured by many poeple to do something else, being pulled in nearly every direction. The
pressure and the shortness of time made me not think clearly. I really should have known better that it would happen that way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I really would like an idea what they have in mind, when AEU is no longer apart of the Accord. If they even have the smallest of plans...
they should fill us in. If they don't, than that is just stupid."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "We both should have known better. But you're right, there was a constant pressure on you to come up with more and better solutions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Should've just burned an effigy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And I don't blame you for it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "And honestly, from the way First Speaker Shea puts it, it will be good for the Union for a time. It will probably seem really good at first, like we
never should have even protested it. But in the end it's going to be bad for all the alliances."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes, it is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh yeah, I mean with what they have planned I won't be surprised if the economy booms."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But credits aren't going to buy us safety."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Not in the long run."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Time to train more pilots.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Because -we're- going to need them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Sigh and we still have to worry about privatisation too. Hopefully it won't be so bad."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright, guys, I'm shipping out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ather, of course, would say i'm being delusional."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be back around in 10 days or two weeks or so."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Ugh, we're gonna miss you Constantine, you better come back damnit."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Good luck with everything."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Privatisation isn't a bad thing... Unless we can know what /we/ are doing.. and how that is suppossed to workk."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Make notes at the meeting I'm sure you guys will have while I'm gone."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I mean, if we have to pay for our own ships... then we better be paid full for all our work."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I will Constantine, I'll be sure to kep you informed. You might even just have a bunch of mail when you come back."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That would be nice, stuff to read."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah I feel like the paying for our own ships thing is unlikely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Hey Constantine?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "More likely is that we'd borrow them like we currently do from Unreality."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If you can, will you try to keep an ear and and eye out for how things over in Velouria?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's where you are going, right?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I don't know if I can face my family, so I wasn't planning to go home."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I was going to try and go to the crash sites."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Oh, well wherever you go, an update of how things are on the ground would be nice."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "And help clear away rubble and rebuild."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Certainly."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "One for a nest? Tier three or lower."
[Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm game."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Alright."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I've been trying to arrange for some medical supplies and food drops, since they don't want people touching the Merry Band stuff, though I doubt
there's anyting wrong with it."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "He can go if he likes."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Poisoning a bunch of random folks isn't really kelsey's style."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Sure, Johnathon, Real Earth lounge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I think in this case, Kelsey actually does want to help."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I agree Constantine."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "However, the administration not wanting to accept anything from Kelsey doesn't surprise me."
[Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "My suit is at SVP."
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "We'll go pick it up."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right, since they've been pushing the whole thing about unregs and pirates being the biggest threat."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Yeah."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "But yeah I'll listen for people's opinions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "If they're willing to share them."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Thanks man.. Be careful down there, people probably aren't too happy with us. Hopefully they don't even know it's you."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Since our names were never released."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "That's what I'm hoping, but I feel I need to face it either way."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "I'll be careful."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria trundles slowly into the area.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Constantine Stone transmits, "Alright guys, I'll see you when I return."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, I hear that. I want do whatever I can to help those folks."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Take care."
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

Major Change:
Asteroid Mining Expansion
Miners with bronze, silver, or gold mining licenses now have a random chance of being offered a special type of asteroid to process. You can decline this offer and work a normal site instead if you
prefer.
* Metal-rich: These asteroids simply have more ore to process, and are a much bigger target for poachers.
* Comet: On comets, you may extract water ice for a boost to your payout. Ice is extracted using separate ice mining buildings, but the ice does not require processing.
* Radioactive: The third tier processors and higher will be able to extract radioactives as well as metal from your ore, boosting your payout. To support the power requirements of these advanced
processors, radioisotope thermoelectric generators will be available.
The asteroids you're used to are now known as rocky asteroids.
Special asteroid types should provide approximately a 10-20% boost to payout at the cost of the special considerations outlined above. As always, please report any outsized rewards or other issues with
the new asteroids.
[MTTS] alc_71: That all sounds great. Thanks.
[MTTS] Ulias: That sounds neato mosquito.
[MTTS] something: Very cool.
[MTTS] something: Will new drones be required to transport new resources?
[MTTS] blindbat84: Ooooo I likey very muchy.
[MTTS] usfolks: Oh nice. Thanks.
[MTTS] Butchulla: That just sounds awesome. I look forward to seeing this.
[MTTS] Squidmind: No. I might continue to expand it, though. Special buildings for specific asteroid types open up some possibilities.
[MTTS] something: I had been thinking that you'd need a special type of transport bay to keep ice from melting, then I realised, space.
[MTTS] muhala: When you talk about the third tier processors, do you mean processors or drilling platforms? Just wanting to make sure I understood properly.
[MTTS] voyager1000: That looks pretty nice, the change implies only more poacher targets on metal rich roids, is that how it's meant to read?
[MTTS] Squidmind: Processors.
[Tactical Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Crias clear."
[MTTS] muhala: Awesome, thank you. I like mining, but it is becoming somewhat less challenging. This will add awesome spice to the dish of my credit serving.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Yes, there are only extra poachers on metal-rich types, for now at least. The cost of the other two types is more research and building.
[MTTS] Squidmind: Though I'm hoping the metal-rich asteroids will make it more worthwhile to research higher tier defenses. Getting some use out of the higher tier buildings was one of the major goals
here.
[MTTS] Ulias: I usually do that anyways just for fun, personally.
[MTTS] voyager1000: It'd definitely be nice to have reasons to use the larger, more expensive to research buildings.
[MTTS] Grunze: I think you have succeeded.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated
cooler, a letter, a letter, an insulated purple sleeping bag, a pair of gray canvas sneakers, and a Tardick lizard named Asteria here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is sleeping on an insulated purple sleeping bag.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

afk
You blink heavily and then doze off.
[MTTS] something: Even without a minmax reason to do it, I think a bunch of us did experiment with it for the hell of it at least once.
[MTTS] muhala: Oh and thank you for giving us an estimate on what we should expect for the payout. That will help with any overpay issues.
[MTTS] voyager1000: I definitely researched everything at least once, just to try it.
[MTTS] something: The only thing I've never messed with is the drone upgrade stuff.
A Tardick lizard named Asteria blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily:
This letter is an example of uncooperative behavior. So is the example you named. So are the issues Morris and Evenia and Melinda have communicated to me which I'm sure you're familiar with. But here's
what it comes down to.
I don't report to you. No one except the people in your own org need to report to you. We're supposed to be in this together. This attitude you guys are stewing in has to change or you will continue to
find yourselves isolated. Get out of the bubble you're in, talk to people, and clear the air. Otherwise nothing is going to change and I'll just wish you good luck with your solo endeavors.

Nissi Valdaire says, "Which wasn't good, and that's what caused Ather to ask us not to include SEAS. But that was just one reason."

Shule sits on the edge of his chair and leaning forward, listens intently.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Before that I'd gotten several complaints about how it wasn't easy for others to work with you or have their ideas considered."
Nissi Valdaire says, "And now, well, there's this thing with Shule threatening my alliance with open hostilities, that's kind of a big one."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks.
Melinda Michaels says, "Um."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Wait how did Shule threaten with open hostilities?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "About the complaints we got, Melinda probably has a better handle on the details than I do."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was there and he certainly did not."
Melinda Michaels says, "Oh yes he did."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Well he did in the letter he sent me."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Beacons anyone?"
[Tactical Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I shall do this."
[Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sure."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Afterwards I learned Constantine didn't know anything of it and it sounds like nobody else did either, so I'm not worried it'll come to anything. But being officially threatened like
that kinda sets some things in motion."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident looks at you thoughtfully.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I had to notify our government, allies, all that stuff."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "May I have 2 more for beacons?"
Melinda Michaels turns off a tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator.
Lily says to you, "I certainly didn't interpret that letter which you sent me a copy of as threatening anything. But you did point out that Morris's behavior was not in keeping with what one would expect
amongst us who are from different alliances particularly when we do have a NAP."
Melinda Michaels says, "There was a flat out threat in that letter."
Melinda Michaels says, "There is no way of ignoring it."
'Well, perhaps neither of us interpreted it as a threat, but it seems they did.
You say, "Well, perhaps neither of us interpreted it as a threat, but it seems they did."
Lily says to you, "Did you intend that to be a threat?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "Well as I explained in my reply, friendly fire incidents are almost always the fault of the victim, if you consider them the fault of anybody."
Nissi Valdaire says, "To pretend it was an intentional act is very disingenuous."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Earth lounge please."
Nissi Valdaire says, "The ship that accidentally hits a friendly usually couldn't have done anything to avoid it."
'I understand that. It wasn't the act of the friendly fire that I was concerned about, but the response afterwords.
You say, "I understand that. It wasn't the act of the friendly fire that I was concerned about, but the response afterwords."
Nissi Valdaire says, "So to say that open hostilities will exist if another incident like that takes place... yeah, that's a threat."
Melinda Michaels asks, "You're gonna threaten like that because somebody shoots off at the mouth?"
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "I see some activity underway, but no performance goals reached yet! Let's keep going!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is true and all that I ever said was 'please watch your fire. I said nothing hostile but Morris got on his high-horse and responded very rudely. If it were
someone from a ship I was flying, I would say we're sorry and i'll ask my crew to be more careful."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Just common courtessy you kow?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Lnow?"
A Tardick lizard named Zeus curls its tail loosely around Melinda Michaels's neck.
Melinda Michaels says, "Morris did run his mouth and it wasn't necessary. But to threaten ending our pact because somebody is being stupid, is quite a bit overboard."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Well I mean, 'watch your fire' is a useless statement. Anybody experienced at flying in invasions gets annoyed at that because friendly fire is almost always the victim's fault."
Nissi Valdaire says, "It doesn't matter how careful the crew is."
Nissi Valdaire says, "If anybody shoulda been more careful, it was the pilot of your ship."
Nissi Valdaire says, "But realistically you can't track the position of every enemy so it's really useless to blame anybody."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it was Shule's ship nit mine but anyway. 'it's not about blaming here though but how Morris behaved as h though he didn't care."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, OOCly, "Have an issue here give me a couple moments please."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Fine, Morris can be a jerk. I'm not sure threatening open hostilities if Morris is a jerk again is really a good position to take either."
\'I understand and my apologies for being a bit overboard. I have heard many times though, of people asking other ships to watch their fire. Yeah, it's a pretty useless statment as we do try really hard
to watch where we are tracking.
You say, "I understand and my apologies for being a bit overboard. I have heard many times though, of people asking other ships to watch their fire. Yeah, it's a pretty useless statment as we do try
really hard to watch where we are tracking."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Either way it was a threat and we had to react to it."
Melinda Michaels says, "You can't put all this on Morris. Yes he was in the wrong but so was Shule. This is part of the problem. You don't seem to shoulder any blame when it is shared."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident slumps in a faux wood padded chair and goes to sleep.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I'm not sure you're getting it. People do watch their fire. Friendly fire almost always happens when an enemy moves and a friendly moves into their coordinates. The shooting ship is
tracking the correct target but the victim got in the way."
Nissi Valdaire says, "People who insist that everybody 'watch their fire' don't understand what's happening."
Nissi Valdaire says, "And yeah, that's what all this always comes down to. You guys point the finger everywhere but at yourselves. You can't clear the air about a situation when some of the people in it
won't accept any responsibility."

You say, "I'd be willing to write you a letter to pass on to the government apologizing for my over reaction."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily says to you, "Did you really intend this to be a threat though?"
Melinda Michaels says, "Saying we'll get the pact ended or view something as an act of war is a threat."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Last call, one more for a beacon?"
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "Yes."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Earth lounge."
-lily No, I already said that I never intended it as a threat, but they obviously reacted to it as  though they felt threatened. Therefore, I should at least write a letter apologizing for the threat.
You say to Lily, "No, I already said that I never intended it as a threat, but they obviously reacted to it as though they felt threatened. Therefore, I should at least write a letter apologizing for the

Nissi Valdaire removes a small black leather portfolio from a small chaingun-shaped black vinyl shoulder-slung bag for a moment.
Nissi Valdaire removes a sheet of yellow paper from a small black leather portfolio.
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "New or Old Earth?"
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "The sexy one."
Nissi Valdaire says, "'However, he should be warned that if this type of incident happens again and he responds in a like manner, we may not consider it accidental and more than likely consider it a
violation of the NAP between the AEU and the League.'"
[Tactical Communication] James Donovan transmits, "I'm at manhattan spaceport presently."
[Tactical Communication] Katina Faye transmits, "Right on."
Nissi Valdaire says, "That's what's written."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well our reaction was though that Morris wanted to be hostile especiall yby his tone so he really didn't give us much choice but to interpret his intentions as hostile
though. Still I don't think that Shule wanted to threaten anyone except to express that we've agreed to get along under the current agreement and I didn't have the impresion that Morris intended to."
Melinda Michaels asks, "So anytime somebody gets stupid and runs their mouth, are we to worry about you guys wanting to cut off the agreement?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "No but common courtessy certainly goes a long way don't you think?"
Nissi Valdaire removes a small black leather portfolio from a small chaingun-shaped black vinyl shoulder-slung bag for a moment.
Nissi Valdaire puts a sheet of yellow paper in a small black leather portfolio.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Common courtesy goes both ways."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Certainly accidental htings occur and and we agree on that point."
Nissi Valdaire says, "This event didn't happen in a vacuum. I mean... it literally did, but you know what I mean."
nod nissi
You nod to Nissi Valdaire.
Melinda Michaels says, "Wanting to end our agreement because somebody is rude is flat out stupid. I am sorry but it is. Did you guys really believe Morris was going to start a damn war because he was
being mouthy? People are mouthy all the time."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I don't want to deviate from this but I sure would like to hear how I've not been willing to listen or receive ideas. I've often felt I was on my own without any
input form others except when they thought they were left out."
Melinda Michaels says, "Refusing to bend and change where your parts come from. Apparently refusing to change things up in 777. That one is second hand."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Wait."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd like to know the more about that. I have always tried to accomodate LIBS and put parts where they wanted also, it was Johann who specified who setup the stations
and I agreed with him."
Melinda Michaels says, "When Morris started up his org, you had to argue with me because you were refusing to use his core over rift surfers. This is probably because you and Morris don't get along. But,
we had to argue over it for a few letters before you finally agreed to work with it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As for where parts come from? Nobody ever volunteered anything. In fact, I had to write out everything for evenia and she would forget things often. I certainly would
have appreciated other ideas."
Melinda Michaels says, "I dunno, she doesn't seem to have issues when she builds for me."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So this is really news to me. I even asked them repeatedly if certain parts were ok for them. She wanted to use the top charger though perhaps that's why she was
upset."
Melinda Michaels says, "And while we are on this, I am going to clear something up."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So we gave into her."
Melinda Michaels says, "I do not just lower the gavel and make these station decisions on my own. Votes are taken. And as far as new org participation goes, you did have a problem using parts from Morris
at first. Till I pointed out how I let SEAS in when nobody wanted me to do it."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Huh wait I didn't really care so I think you have it the other way around. I was just scrambling to accomodate both Morris and Joel. I did want to get along and you
are the one Melinda who told me you didn't want morris on the Asteroid processor."
Melinda Michaels says, "I did not."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'I still have the letter melinda."
Melinda Michaels says, "I told you that if you could not find a part from Morris, you could use a part from somebody else."
Melinda Michaels says, "And if he was going to be nasty about it and fight with you, then do as you wish."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a small black leather portfolio from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.
Melinda Michaels says, "So yes, I said if you guys couldn't sort it out."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a small black leather portfolio.
Melinda Michaels asks, "Was this when you two were fighting?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a letter in a small black leather portfolio.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a small black leather portfolio.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident removes a letter from a small black leather portfolio.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident puts a letter in a coral pink silk handbag embroidered with pastel dragonflies.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Melinda you specifically asked me not to include Morris because he wasn't qualified yet. So I only set out to honor your request but Morris pressured and I
honestly didn't mind whose core and it has nothing to do with whether or not I like Morris or not."
Melinda Michaels says, "Oh no no, yes then I did."
Melinda Michaels says, "But once he qualified."
Melinda Michaels says, "You did not want to use his core."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Huh that's not so."
Melinda Michaels says, "Because you wanted to use Surfers."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes because that was all I oculd get from them at the time."
Melinda Michaels says, "That's what you told me."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And it had nothing to do with him and no I didn't realize morris was actually qualified by then."
Melinda Michaels says, "I tried to explain to you that we need to make room for new orgs, especially those who wish to vassalize."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Of course and I totally agree."
Melinda Michaels says, "So let surfers and journey take turns."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Let me ask you this..."
Melinda Michaels says, "But you argued the point before we finally got it settled."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok well I never got that about let them take turns but I seill would have gone out of my way to accomodate both."
Nissi says to Lily, "Is there anything you feel you did wrong in this discussion about Morris and his org you had with Melinda?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Mis-understood what Melinda wanted."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I honestly didn't care one way or the other who the orgs were and I was trying to accomodate everyone."
Melinda Michaels says, "You specifically told me you would use surfers cores. It was during the time you and Morris were going on about something."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And regardless of Morris's attitude, I still wouldn't care. It's a business arrangement."
Melinda Michaels says, "Then, after some time, you finally agreed. I dunno whether it was because you didn't read the letters correctly or what."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus flicks its tongue out from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I supose that's it but it was mostly that I thought you didn't want me to put morris on at all and I never got it that he was finally qualified or their taking turns
which would have been fine."
Melinda Michaels says, "I specificly remember pointing out to you that, even when you and I argued, I did not kick you out of the stations. Then you went with the decision."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or if I had parts from both that would fit, I'd accomodate them. So that is what I did."
Melinda Michaels asks, "Okay, what other problems have you got?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "None really except we'd still appreciate the opportunity to work with you all."
Melinda Michaels says, "Because this is going to be a she said she said thing and you've got to read letters twice if you need to do so. It'll help negate confusion and arguing."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sure thing and I shall do that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.
Melinda Michaels says, "Well, I have some issues."
Melinda Michaels says, "Why are you not willing to just say you're sorry for things and move on instead of sitting and blaming everything on everybody else."
Melinda Michaels says, "Because I am gonna be frank here. Everybody is tired of having fingers pointed at them at every turn and people just don't want to work with somebody who isn't willing to
compromise and shoulder some of the blame for things that go wrong."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well i'm not blaming others as you see it though."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah that's kinda the essence of it. Every incident we talk about mostly results from a grudge held from some other incident before that."
Melinda Michaels says, "Yes, you kinda are."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I was just ointing out facts not point blame."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I've got a theory about it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Pointing blame."
Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Nissi Valdaire says, "I think you believe others can't tell when you're acting in bad faith."
Nissi Valdaire says, "But we can. So this stuff about misreading this and not hearing that, it just pisses people off, because it never rings true."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I believe others make a lot of assumptions too which are unfounded."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Without first asking any quesitons."
Melinda Michaels says, "Yes, you believe I make assumptions for one."
Nissi Valdaire says, "And you're doing it again. You're saying none of it is ever your fault."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No i'm not."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It was my fault for not showing up at the protest."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It wasn't that I didn't want ot be there though and this is how you all want to interpret it."
Melinda Michaels says, "Then why didn't you just say sorry that happened and be done. Rather than saying, Johann this, Eli that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because I did feel torn between how Johann has treated me in the past when I didn't get something done."
Melinda Michaels says, "Can you prove how he has treated you? He says he hasn't."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We've discussed it and I think he knows where I was coming from now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Hi."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Have either of you felt that you wanted to please more than one aprty and couldn't?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "One party that is?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Greetings Tara."
Melinda Michaels says, "Of course."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure, but I try to own up to the fact that I made my own decision about it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So this is how it was for me and I hoped it wouldn't take that long and I could try, with the little time I had to show up there."
Melinda Michaels says, "But making excuses and pointing fingers is only going to serve the alienation purpose. People just don't like it. I am sorry would have worked much better."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "How are you?"
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Good, just about to do some roid hualing."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well for me it wasn't finger-pointing. Just expressing that there were circumstances which either involved communications or how I perceived that Johann would treat me
if I didn't put up that lousy beacon."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Right on I'm mining at the moment."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "So you haul 'em and I'll mine 'em."
Melinda Michaels says, "Johann is not involved in station building."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "He is in 777 yes."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We took that project on together."
Melinda Michaels says, "No, he isn't. His org, yes."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's Johann who has generally been the spokesperson."
Melinda Michaels says, "It's kinda like Cats, Nissi doesn't order me around on how to build stations."
Nissi Valdaire asks, "Here's the reason people don't really buy that. If you thought people were gonna be pissed about the beacon and you weren't sure what to do... well first of all, everybody was at the
protest already pretty much, so clearly nobody was that worried about the beacon. But why wouldn't you just ask if anybody minded a delay?"
Melinda Michaels nods. "Even Johann was there."
Nissi Valdaire says, "It always comes down to the fact that Lily did whatever Lily felt like doing. There's always a reason for it, or something that makes it somebody else's fault. But it's always that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When we got back one time the Asteroid processor was down and he was the one tho leaned on me about it and I felt embarrassed that it had gone down and apologized."
Melinda Michaels says, "Then why didn't you come to me if he was making things that rough for you? We weren't involved in 777 but I may could have assisted in stopping the issues."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I am sorry for everything."
Melinda Michaels says, "Stations go down all the time. It happens. If anybody gives you grief, tell me. I am used to yelling at people by now."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok but I know you take on enough so I just took it on but I do want to please folks and I know they depend on the stations and other things."
Melinda Michaels says, "You can't please everybody all of the time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "First Roid is a metal rich. Nice."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs. "Isn't that the truth."
Melinda Michaels asks, "So, what's next then?"
Nissi Valdaire asks, "The thing with Evenia and 777? Did we discuss that at all?"
Melinda Michaels says, "Right, she said she had a couple of ideas like for a message beacon to warn pilots and you told her no."
Melinda Michaels gets a distant look on her face as she ponders. "A message beacon in Mir."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I have no idea. It's pretty much up to you all to decide whether or not you will work with us. As I say setting aside how I regard Morris has nothing to do with how I
would treat him regarding his involvement on any station I would build."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I know you have Evenia working with you and I would add her back to our warehouse."
'What was her idea about 777 and a message beacon?
You ask, "What was her idea about 777 and a message beacon?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah I'd like to know."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.
Melinda Michaels asks, "Did you tell her she couldn't put a message beacon in Mir and that you wouldn't move the 776 beacon Battle of Mir in order to replace 071 and illiminate the need for the extra
station?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Huh no."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "This is total news to me."
Melinda Michaels says, "I see."
Nissi Valdaire says, "We could bring her in here and see if she wants to repeat that story."
Melinda Michaels says, "Eve or Nicolette, somebody, said it ain't happening. Your name got thrown in it."
Melinda Michaels turns on a tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator.
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah."
Melinda Michaels removes a silver flat einrophone from a black leather phone holster.
Melinda Michaels punches a number into a silver flat einrophone.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We don't have anything in battle of mir nor have we ever but we've certainly made changes all along."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We actually started out in b-24."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Where we could use a Solar module but it's obviously farther."
Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:
Melinda Michaels says, "Hey, we are discussing station stuff with Lily. She says she had no disagreements at 777 with you. We are requesting for you to come to our org conference room."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I have never heard this other idea."
Lily says to you, "Did she tell you?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And if so I'd have appreciated knowing about it."
headshake lily 'This is the first I've heard of it, honesty
You shake your head at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "This is the first I've heard of it, honesty."
Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:
Melinda Michaels says, "Okay, yell when you get here."
Melinda Michaels speaks into her silver flat einrophone:
Melinda Michaels says, "Thanks."
Melinda Michaels places a silver flat einrophone into a black leather phone holster.
Melinda Michaels says, "We'll solve this."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I'd sure like to."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "More like love to."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The placement of 776 was jsut the same configuration we generally use outside of an FTL sector I have never heard anything else from anyone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "As for a beacon to warn others why would I be against such a thing?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident blinks.
Nissi Valdaire says, "That's what we said."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "As I say this is the absolute first I've ever heard of this."
Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire.
'I don't see why a message beacon in Mir would be an issue, but then again, what do I know about temp stations.

wave evenia
You wave to Evenia Callseah.
Melinda says to Evenia, "Hey."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Evenia Callseah.
Evenia Callseah waves to you.
Nissi Valdaire says, "We're trying to get to the bottom of all these station issues."
Evenia Callseah sighs. "Well this could take a while."
Evenia Callseah sits down on a faux wood padded chair.
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Evenia Callseah says, "I mentioned to Johann I was coming over. So if there's shit I don't remember. He said he'd come along. I get busy. So forget things."
Melinda says to Evenia, "He's welcome to."
Melinda says to Evenia, "We are told there were no issues with a message beacon at Mir or any other station in 777 between you and Lily. Would you mind to clarify?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah please do as this is the first I ever heard of this Evenia."
"Of course I would." Evenia Callseah nods. "We had many a conversation about stations over the course of the time libs started activly helping with 777. At one point I mentioned the message beacon, as I
mentioned to you guys. But in all of Lily's letters, she never said yes to it. I have most of them still maybe, but there was always plenty of confusion, because sometimes Lily would send 3 or 4 letters
relating to the one thing, and confuse everyone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't recall anything about a message beacon in mir."
Evenia Callseah shrugs. "Well I did ask you."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or in 776 I mean."
Melinda Michaels says, "I think she said it was in Mir."
Evenia Callseah says, "In mir, yes."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well either case why would I oppose something like that?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "A message beacon is a message beacon."
Melinda Michaels says, "Sorry if I don't find any of this funny."
Evenia Callseah says, "Well how am I to know? Sometimes you made many strange decisions relating to that area, and confused the living hell out of me."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't either but I certainly didn't oppose a message beacon anywhere."
Nissi Valdaire asks, "So Lily just never acknowledged the idea at all?"
"I remember bringing it up at least once." Evenia Callseah shakes her head at Nissi Valdaire. "At least. I mean I don't have a photographic memory or anything so I can't tell you when. But I did."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So Evenia if you're saying I didn't respond then how is it you are to arbitrarily assume that I am opposing something? I obviously never got that information to even
have the opportunity to decide on one way or the other."
Melinda says to Evenia, "Did you ever get flat out told no by her on station decisions?"
Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "On which one."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Looks like we've got some things going, but we haven't met any performance goals yet!"
Melinda Michaels says, "I know Johann said he had to take care of letters because the two of you would have issues and he'd handle it."
Evenia Callseah says, "One that I remember very clearly was when we wanted a bit of order out there. You wanted things to remain as...whoever is around, builds whatever, which does not work for me. But
then in those letters, you also mentioned that you somehow thought we wanted you to buy accelloraters, and that you couldn't. that was 4 letters of mess. but you said you didn't want to assign orgs
stations, and just wanted anyone to build whatever."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "No that's not exactly it evenia."
Evenia says to Melinda, "That's true as well. Johann took care of a bunch of those, because I didn't need the constant letters back and fourth."
Evenia Callseah says, "And this issue right here. Is one that Johann took care of. Because I tossed my hands in the air and told him to deal with it."
Nissi Valdaire asks, "Should Johann be in here then?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "What I said was it was a good idea to portion off the stations so that we had defined responsibilities but I still wanted the assurance that if one org wasn't
available to put up a station, that it wouldn't go without attention."
Evenia Callseah says, "Maybe, because he seems to keep that mess straighter than I do."
Nissi Valdaire nods. "If he knows the details on it and wants to try to untangle all this."
Evenia Callseah says, "I'm not going to battle basic words with you. But I don't have those letters. So I can't show you what you said."
Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "Johann."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So'well I know what I said and i've probably got most letters that I've sent."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Melinda Michaels says into her tyrian purple metachannel FTL communicator, "We are in the org conference room. Do you mind to come in?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sitll though I was fine with the division of the responsibilities I jsut wanted assurance that if someone wasn't available we would back one anothe rup so I honestly
thought that was where it stood."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I only mad parts available for that purpose so noone would have to hunt down the other party if they needed to build a station."
Melinda Michaels says, "Well as it stands currently, stations will be listed in the book. I am gonna wield the hammer of power and say that you will have to go by the set up."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Made that is."
Melinda Michaels scrambles to her feet.
Melinda Michaels strolls out.
Melinda Michaels just arrived, followed by her group.

wave johann
You wave to Johann Schraft.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Hey."
Johann Schraft says, "Hello everyone."
Lily says to Johann, "If I might ask didn't we come to an agreement concerning dividing up the stations between both orgs?"
Melinda Michaels says to Johann, "There is some disagreement about Eve wanting more organized station setups in 777 and Lily not. Do you know anything about it?"
Johann Schraft says, "There was some confusion at first yes."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "So is that horrible?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I certainly didn't refuse anything and I was very happy with the outcome."
Evenia Callseah says, "When that confusion is in 4 letters and says 4 different things in the space of 2 hours, yes."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well that happens because sometimes things need to be sorted out."
Johann Schraft says, "Umm, we did end up working things out. Each org was the primary caretaker of four stations."
Evenia Callseah says, "Normally I'd do that without 4 different letters saying different things before someone could even respond to the firt."
Evenia Callseah coughs. "First."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.
Johann Schraft says, "Everything was going well until the protest."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Sorry evenia but it's been what a couple of months ago so I don't sit on things like that. I really find it more productive that we came to an agreement."
Melinda Michaels says, "I think Eve's problem here is that it should not take mounds of letters to make an agreement over stations."
Evenia Callseah says, "And it shouldn't end up stressing a person to the point where they could give a fuck less."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well then respond to the first one or suggest we get together and discuss it."
Evenia Callseah says, "That's a little hard when the 3 letters all come at once."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I certainly have felt that way too you know but I sometimes have limited time to work so I have to use the mail but I'm always willing to discuss things."
Evenia Callseah says, "I haven't been more relaxed since I got things in order out there. And I haven't enjoyed building stations more. There was so much stress related to all that. But now there's none.
Zero. I know what needs doing and when. And there is zero drama."
Melinda Michaels says, "From where I sit, this is the problem."
Johann says to Lily, "I know you like to communicate via the mail. It's not a bad thing, but when there's maybe any confusion, I know a face-to-face, or even a phone call can help clear things up more
speedily, and yes, with less stress all around."
Melinda Michaels says, "A, blaming others for everything. B, not fully paying attention and making decisions more stressful than they need to be. And C, getting your backs up and making threats of war
over a mouthy pilot."
Melinda Michaels asks, "Am I incorrect here?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nobody has made any threats of war at all here."
Evenia says to Melinda, "That pretty much says it in one."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Yeah that kinda sums it up."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Well Johann, you have always called me when you had questions and I responded right?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I ahve also called you."
Evenia says to Lily, "And how many times did I ask you respectfully for your number so I could do that?"
Melinda Michaels says, "But Lily, you portrayed him as being nasty with you."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Everything just goes straight to being personal and things start being motivated by grudges."
Johann says to Lily, "Sometimes you are hard to get a hold of, but yes, if I call, or write you and ask you to call me, you will."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Evenia I have never had any other means to communicate with you though and if I'm not seeing you on the comm,i only have one other means to communicate."
Melinda Michaels says, "I hate to do things this way."
Johann Schraft nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes because I don't work fulltime anymore."
Melinda Michaels says, "But if we are to sort things, there are more pissed off pilots than those in this room."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am not able to help that and i'm sorry for that."
Melinda Michaels says, "So I am gonna make two suggestions."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Is anyone busy that would like to take a quick, and I mean quick, trip across the skim?"
Melinda Michaels says, "First, Lily is probably going to have to publically apologize on the boards because she did do the blame game publically."
Melinda Michaels says, "I don't know how it will be received."
A Tardick lizard named Zeus, perched on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, blinks its yellow eyes slowly, utterly indifferent to its surroundings.
Melinda Michaels asks, "Are there any disagreements there?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.
"I think that's a good idea." Evenia Callseah shakes her head. "Even if it isn't received well by everyone, that's a hell of a start."
Johann Schraft says, "I have no issues."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Sure."
Nissi Valdaire asks, "My only question is what resolution are we trying to get?"
Nissi Valdaire says, "I think there's two things to decide."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Whether SEAS parts get included on the main stations everybody elses and whether SEAS people are in charge of building any of those stations."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Evenia Callseah nods to Nissi Valdaire.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Everybody uses that is."
Melinda says to Lily, "While I understand we all get upset and spout off by times, can I get your word that you will work hard to just learn to apologize and not drag everybody in it while doing so?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "'i'll say that for 777 that we're more than happy to resume maintaining the 4 stations we agreed on and we're also open for changes to their configuration."
Johann Schraft says, "I still feel as though Evenia needs an personal apology though for all the hurtful things she sent. I don't care if it's public or not, if it is good enough for Evenia, it's good
enough for me."
Melinda Michaels says, "Eve is in charge of 777 now. You will take that up with her once everybody figures out if they want to try this again."
Evenia Callseah says, "All I need to hear is a basic apology. I don't need any kind of public display."
Lily says to Evenia, "I am sorry for what I said."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do have some trust issues though and hopefully time will change those."
Evenia says to Lily, "In that case. When things are resolved. If things go in the right direction. Consider seas back on stations that I maintain."
Johann Schraft nods.
Nissi Valdaire nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "Second, for a probationary period, no changes are to be made to the station setup that will be published in the new booklet without discussing them with me. All this arguing is
utter nonsense and should never happen. So, I'll try to help where I can to keep it from happening again."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Melinda Michaels.
Lily says to Melinda, "Do you want us to resume with the Asteroid Processor?"
Melinda Michaels says, "I hate being like that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's fine."
"That works." Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "Any random issues that come up, I'll let you know personally."
Melinda Michaels says, "Nobody is resuming anything till we see what people think after this apology. I did not force everybody not to work with SEAS and won't force them to do so."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok."
Evenia Callseah nods.
Nissi Valdaire says, "Just so I'm clear I'm not suggesting taking anything away that Eve has just taken on. I don't think that would be right. Unless it's Eve's decision to turn anything over for her own
reasons."
Evenia says to Lily, "But whatever way it goes. I appreciate your apology. And I think we both have trust issues. But we have plenty of time."
Melinda Michaels says, "No, even if Lily helps build stations. Eve is in charge of what happens out there."
Nissi Valdaire nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well Constantine enjoys building and he would be more than happy to help with ours or anytime you need him to. He has a lot on his plate right now so he might not be
as available but he wants to contribute when he can."
Evenia Callseah nods to Nissi Valdaire. "Thank you both." Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "Depending on how this apology and whatnot goes, we can figure out details then."
Evenia Callseah says, "Yeah. Constantine is actually a good and reliable builder."
Melinda Michaels says, "Yeah, we need a station coordinator office."
Melinda Michaels laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I actually think that's a good idea."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Pretty much."
Johann Schraft glances at Evenia Callseah and glances at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
A Tardick lizard named Zeus turns to regard its surroundings from its perch on Melinda Michaels's shoulder, and its spine ridges flicker blue for a brief moment.
Melinda says to Lily, "So my last question, are you truly sorry for your part in all this mess?"
"Only if the deputy is allowed in there too." Evenia Callseah grins at Melinda Michaels. "I want the spoils damn it."
Lily says to Evenia, "I will add you back to our warehouse with standard access."
Johann Schraft says, "And I never mind being a mediator if things get tense. I can work with anyone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So I have one more thing to bring up."
Melinda Michaels says, "Okay."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I am not certain where Starseekers is on anything."
Melinda Michaels shrugs. "Neither are we."
Evenia says to Lily, "Thank you. And I will personally fix your access to ours. But just so there's no confusing. My actions will depend on how this apology is received."
Nissi Valdaire asks, "Is Starseekers even active at this point?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I do have access to their warehouse."
Melinda Michaels says, "I saw Eva the other day."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well it's hard to say."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Hm."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I see Angel and Evangelin occassionally."
Melinda Michaels says, "I am going to write Kim a letter and see what her plans are."
Nissi Valdaire nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Evenia Callseah says, "I was wondering that same thing too actually."
Johann Schraft says, "Still, once their parts are gone, they're gone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I put all of the shared parts between sEAS and Starseekers back into Starseekers warehouse."
Evenia says to Melinda, "So for the time being, carry on using the batteries I've been using?"
Melinda says to Evenia, "Yup."
Nissi Valdaire says, "If an org goes inactive I don't see an issue with booting them off. If they get things going again then they can be back on with our apologies. But there's no need to haul dead
weight with as many orgs as we need to accommodate."
Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels. "I figured, just wanted to double check."
Nissi Valdaire says, "Just my opinion."
nod
You nod.
Melinda says to Lily, "A word of advice when you do that apology, don't drag others names into it. Just be real and go with how you feel about your part in the mess."
Melinda Michaels nods to Nissi Valdaire. "I agree."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well there are a bunch of power plants that SEAS and starseekers purchased together, it would be good to use those but if you don't htink it's the right thing to do, I
unserstand and would probably be best if Kim gave her ok to that."
"I agree with you." Evenia Callseah nods to Nissi Valdaire. "It's not like they can't be put back on eventually."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So if we're added back, then what would we contribute? We were buying power plants."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I'm not against using parts that are already paid for and waiting. Just maybe that should be the end of it until one of them is around to properly deal with things."
Melinda Michaels says, "If all works out, we'll use the batteries in Starseekers warehouse then will stop if they don't show to be working towards helping out. There is no need for SEAS to lose
megacredits because they don't know what they are doing."
Evenia Callseah says, "Well when I wrote out the station setup for 777 for example, I had seas down with seekers on batteries."
Melinda Michaels nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "We'll leave that as is till the batteries or the org is gone."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Ok that works and I honestly don't think Kim would mind since she only didn't want us to participate on income-producing stations while AEU was on strike but I can't
speak for her altogether."
Evenia Callseah nods. "Well then we could just switch to seas batteries and that covers that."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Anyway, if you don't have access, I can move parts over."
Melinda says to Lily, "Well, the faster you get that heartfelt apology out there, the faster this gets sorted."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Melinda Michaels says, "And please be careful in the future. I don't want to have to deal with this mess again."
Evenia Callseah says, "I don't think I have access to the seekers warehouse. I feel like I only have access to seas and invaders on new earth."
Nissi Valdaire asks, "Yeah, I guess that's it for station issues then. Is everybody satisfied? Anything else to bring up?"
Melinda Michaels says, "In fact, I won't. If it keeps happening, I am done."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident shakes her head.
Melinda says to Lily, "You aren't satisfied?"
"Can I agree with you and not seem like super bitch II?" Evenia Callseah nods to Melinda Michaels.
Nissi Valdaire grins.
Johann says to Nissi, "I have one small detail for you and Melinda I want to start thinking about at any rate, but nothing that requires everyone here."
Lily says to Evenia, "Ok well jsut let me know what you'd need from Starseekers. I still have some fission Breeders in Seas warehouse too."
Nissi Valdaire nods to Johann Schraft.
Melinda says to Lily, "When the new one is published, get the book and use it."
"I will 'we'll figure out all that after your post." Evenia Callseah nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Also good luck with that, I hope it's received as well as it can be. It's been a tough couple
of months for everyone, and emotions have run high."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I want to thank you all for your time and I want to express my sincerest appreciation for us coming together to discuss things."
Melinda Michaels nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident. "Yes, good luck."
Johann Schraft says, "Discussions are wonderful things."
Johann Schraft grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a small hot beverage dispenser, a small hot coffee dispenser, an overstuffed dark green chair, a compact white refrigerator, a small red insulated

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Subject: My Apology - i am Truly Sorry
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 02:55 28 September 2317 GST

Hello Everyone,
After a lot of personal angst over the past several weeks, I feel that I must say to you all how truly sorry I am for my behavior. Although I know some have mis-understood my intentions, I do forgive you
for this.
I'm sorry to Eli and to Ather for letting you down during the protest against Outccord and I should have ignored my own drive to serve to keep things going in 777 and i should have just turned around.
I apologize to Johann and Evenia as well.
I apologize to everyone else for dragging you all into this mess and i will do whatever i can to avoid any future infractions.
I mean what I say in sincerety.
Kind regards,
Lily Kaise

[MTTS] usfolks: Ok...this is a dumb question, and I ask probably more because I'm working on not enough sleep, but...by third tier processors, that means the enhanced, right? Basic isn't considered some
zero tier or something?
[MTTS] davetaylor: I guess so, I don't think I've ever heard them described that way though.
[MTTS] usfolks: Well I didn't think so, but my sleep-deprived brain tends to make things much more complicated than they really are.
[MTTS] Butchulla: If I remember the conversation from earlier correctly, it does mean that processor.
[MTTS] usfolks: Ok. Thanks.
[MTTS] usfolks: Also, if any hosts are around, I love the notification that no more poachers are incoming. That's an awesome addition.
[MTTS] davetaylor: I'm going to love that notification too, that is awesome.
[MTTS] usfolks: You guys have been giving us some amazing things lately. And we're very, very grateful.
Cheri-Pye the large light violet felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders in from the north.
[MTTS] davetaylor: I have to agree with that, with that, the gradual but stable changes, and the briliant plot lines, SC is the best.
[MTTS] usfolks: Amen to that.
[MTTS] voyager1000: It was said earlier that the idea was to make more of the buildings have purpose, and as far as I know, most people stick to the first two processors, so third would be the actual
third, or second researched.
[MTTS] davetaylor: I wasn't around for said conversation sadly, as mining is one of my favourite things.
[MTTS] usfolks: Thanks Voyager1000. That's what I was thinking, but I'm working on 2.5 hours sleep.
[MTTS] voyager1000: No worries.
[MTTS] usfolks: Now I have to admit that a 'faster research' upgrade would be fucking awesome.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Agreed.

[MTTS] Ulias: Sorry couldn't respond, enhanced is the tier 3 one. The info on it has actually been changed to include the bit about radioactive stuff.
[MTTS] Ulias: Er. Enahnced is the tier 3 one, Imean.
[MTTS] usfolks: Ugg! Now I see that. I have a habit of not reading an entire line if I see the info I need because my eyes don't focus and have a small field of vision. Ok...now I feel REALLY dumb. Heh.
[MTTS] usfolks: So thank you so much Ulias. And everyone else too.
[MTTS] davetaylor: Ah, I've just noticed the changes to mining, they didn't show up in my changelog new for some reason.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two
narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a
white four poster rattan bed with a heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow, a hand-made
purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow on it, a small purple trash bin, and a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is lying on a white four poster rattan bed.
You can go out.

Subject: Re: My Apology - i am Truly Sorry
Author: Erik Goodwin

I love how, in the same breath where you try to explain how you've seen your mistakes, you decide to throw in an I forgive you for misinterpreting me. I feel pretty confident in saying that you're not
sorry at all and just want back on stations.

I agree with Erik. I actually thought that before he said anything. I held back thinking I might have been overreacting. I'm more sure now than ever that you're only interested in stations.
If it were my decision, I'd insist you had to wait at least six months because as people keep saying, words are meaningless. It's those actions that tell people everything we need to know about how sorry
you really are.

Star Conquest Help: Civilian Liaisons
--
Category: Game Systems
--
Civilian liaisons are pilots in your alliance, just like you, who have the added ability to act as go-betweens between the pilot corps and your alliance government. These serve for one term lasting six
weeks, and then the positions are up for nomination and voting once again.
The actual positions differ among the alliances, but they all have the same basic four functions.
* Voice - The Voice has the power to speak directly with the alliance government. He or she can also manage voting by the pilot corps.
* Space Defense - The person in charge of space defense is able to monitor the alliance's sectors and send information directly to alliance ships.
* Ground Squad - The person in charge of ground-based combat can view information about the alliance's ground readiness and monitor ground actions in progress.
* Industrial Whip - The industrial whip is able to monitor the corps' progress toward achieving its performance goals or winning Conquest.

In addition, there is a counterpart liaison within the alliance government. This person is a government official who is in charge of issues relating to the civilian pilot corps. Note that, as a regular
civilian pilot, you should generally not contact these people directly -- that is the job of your Voice. But if there is a pressing need to go over the head of your Voice, or if, as Voice, you wish to
communicate privately for some reason, you may wish to write a letter to your official government liaison directly.

Special Term Actions
Regular nominations and voting both occur automatically. However, there are other actions that may occur during a term. These actions are not based in coded mechanics, but rather must be roleplayed
appropriately with your Voice or a government liaison.
Non-binding resolutions: The most common special action. Non-binding resolutions, or proposals, can be initiated by the Voice at any time using the voting machine in your liaison office's conference room.
All active pilots are free to vote however they wish on this proposal. The Voice may then communicate the results to the government. However, the government is not obligated to take any action that it
does not consider appropriate no matter how many pilots support it; hence "non-binding."
Recall elections: A recall election occurs when an elected office-holder has performed unsatisfactorily and a vote is held to determine whether to remove him or her from office before the term has ended.
Most properly, more than one pilot should petition the Voice to initiate such a proposal before it occurs. After an appropriate time, the proposal can be ended and the results should be communicated to
the government. If the pilots are in favor of a recall and the government considers their reasoning valid, the office-holder in question will be removed. Pilots may also initiate such an action against
their Voice, if the situation calls for it, by petitioning their liaison within the government.
Resignations: An office-holder may communicate to their government, either through the Voice or directly, that they cannot complete their term and wish to resign. Usually such a resignation will be
accepted within a day or two, leaving the position vacant. This action should not be taken lightly, and all players should seek to complete their terms. It is a responsibility both ICly and OOCly.
Special election: A special election occurs when a position is vacant in the middle of a term (for instance, after a resignation or a recall election) and must be filled. The Voice should allow at least
24 hours to take nominations and should then list all interested candidates in a single proposal. At the end of the vote, the results must be communicated to the government and the position will be
filled. Note that this is the only valid way to fill a vacant position; an office-holder cannot, for example, resign their position and name someone else to fill it.
Negotiations: Voices are authorized to call meetings with representatives from other pilot corps and negotiate for new treaties or other changes in relations. A Voice should communicate openly with his or
her government and their own pilot corps throughout this process, and verify via voting that their actions have the corps' approval at every step in the process. A final non-binding resolution must occur
to verify the final terms of the agreement. If the government approves the agreement, official documents will be provided for all parties to sign in a final meeting. Note that all treaties must be
justified by good roleplaying and must fit current plotlines; buddies in different alliances often want to make their respective corps exchange technology and such, but unless their alliances have a
lengthy history of good relations, the governments are unlikely to consider such an exchange. Behind the scenes, theme, current plotlines, and game balance are all taken into consideration when players
are seeking new treaties.
Declaration of war: A corps may unilaterally declare war against another pilot corps. While this does not usually pit the alliances themselves against each other, it will greatly escalate tensions. There
should be a good reason to consider such an action, or the government will be questioning the Voice rather strenuously. Otherwise, the usual rules about non-binding resolutions apply.
In all corps actions, all pilots should be invited to gather to discuss the new proposal. Witnesses should also be invited when the Voice determines the results of a proposal. The date and time of any
important meeting should be communicated to the government in case the government liaison wishes to attend.
Note, finally, that all office-holders are under particular scrutiny, both by their government and the media, and unwise remarks or actions can result in controversy.
The Current Term
A civilian liaison term lasts for six weeks.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Ather,
As you know, I sent a letter to Nissi regarding the incident in which my clipper, "Firestorm" was fired upon by a League cruiser. Now, I am well aware that accidental friendly fire happens. I myself have
been guilty of inflicting fire on friendly ships due to circumstances not always within my control. Nissi's response to me was essentially that it was accidental fire resulting from me moving into
coordinates at which the League cruiser had already begun firing. However, this was not the case.
I distinctly remember the tracking information for the enemy updating twice very quickly indicating first, that the enemy had moved and then that my ship had moved to new coordinates. Immediately after my
tracking information had updated, the League cruiser locked on my clipper. Then, upon hearing my engine sounds die out as a result of the ship completing its maneuver, I heard the distinctive rattle of
chain gun rounds striking the hull along with the computer announcement that we had been hit by the cruiser. Clearly, this indicates that I had not just moved into range after they had begun firing, they
clearly locked on me and fired.
Now, I admit that my statements at the end of my letter to Nissi were probably an over reaction, but my point had been simply that accidental fire was one thing. The fact that the league cruiser locked on
my ship, fired and then Morris making his comment over tactical, lead me to believe that perhaps it had not been accidental. I only wish to inform Nissi of the situation and express my concern for my ship
and my crew if the fire had really not been accidental. Nissi and Melinda want a full apology for my threat at the end of my letter and for insinuating that the league cruiser fired on my clipper on
purpose. I am generally not a violent person and would not just open hostilities without first receiving instructions to do so from the government. As the only active Ace pilot of the AEU and soon to be
Voice of the Corps, I'd like to ask for your advice as how to proceed from here. I do not wish to make this an inter alliance issue, but I strongly feel I was not at fault here. Thank you for your
consideration.

Rahab Cassidy
She appears to be 29 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has freckled skin. Her body is full-figured with attractively curved hips and thick calves. She has rounded shoulders and
slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is round, lightly-freckled, and plain, with an arched nose and round chin. Her lips are plump and reddish pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of white
teeth. Beneath a set of plucked eyebrows, her eyes are grey and round. Her mid-back length, wavy hair is light honey brown and hanging in a thick, fluffy mass over her shoulders. She has long clear
fingernails. She has a flashy pale pink crystal snowflake hairpin in her hair. She has a small mole on her neck.
 She is wearing a pale pink satin v-neck tee, a platinum watch with a round face, a pair of faded blue jeans, and a pair of shiny black boots. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a
portable newsfeed aggregator, a red metachannel FTL communicator, a small cloth sack, a flight control scanner, an alliance information assistant, and a standard starship flightbag. Her head, face, both
eyes, neck, both elbows, both forearms, left wrist, and both hands are left uncovered.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great
view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around
with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table
to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

Eli Grey (EAOS Elementalist)
This is a slim, almost delicate-looking battlesuit, painted dark silver all over. It resembles some sort of large humanoid robot. A slim cockpit encases the pilot's torso, while the pilot's arms and legs
extend into a framework of hydraulics and cables with some protective plating. A laser attachment is mounted to the right wrist. A large plasma cannon is mounted to the left forearm, a neutronium-laced
metal tube leading to a large tank on the back of the suit. A secondary attachment with a small plasma duct, several defensive lasers, and an EMM is mounted to the left shoulder. A large subsonic
projector is mounted to the left shoulder.
It appears to be 0% damaged.

somewhere! And the bugs. Always the bugs.

[Starship "Daisy May"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

changelog
Recent Major Changes:
-----
Asteroid Mining Expansion
Miners with bronze, silver, or gold mining licenses now have a random chance of being offered a special type of asteroid to process. You can decline this offer and work a normal site instead if you
prefer.
* Metal-rich: These asteroids simply have more ore to process, and are a much bigger target for poachers.
* Comet: On comets, you may extract water ice for a boost to your payout. Ice is extracted using separate ice mining buildings, but the ice does not require processing.
* Radioactive: The third tier processors and higher will be able to extract radioactives as well as metal from your ore, boosting your payout. To support the power requirements of these advanced
processors, radioisotope thermoelectric generators will be available.
The asteroids you're used to are now known as rocky asteroids.
Special asteroid types should provide approximately a 10-20% boost to payout at the cost of the special considerations outlined above. As always, please report any outsized rewards or other issues with
the new asteroids.

we could do it."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new
starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel
doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the
rest of the spaceport.

[MTTS] aaronjw89: I have a question for staff around if anyone is available.
[MTTS] aaronjw89: It's just a random bit.
[MTTS] aaronjw89: Are there are a way to keep character notes of logs of goals, thoughts, actions taken, things of that for the staff to look over to get a look of character rp to achieve goals, or
perhaps let staff in on things a character does or no? I have played a few games that have this, and was wondering. I wanted to start trying to keep track of things and maybe flush out my character and
try and help staff keep track of that, but don't necessarily want to be irritating with support tickets and the like. I'm not sure if that's even necessary, but just a random thought.
[MTTS] alc_71: The goals command?
[MTTS] Ulias: There's a goals command.
[MTTS] something: I'm obviously not a member of staff, but there's the goals command.
[MTTS] aaronjw89: There is a goal command? Oh my.
[MTTS] aaronjw89: Well, thank you.
[MTTS] Ulias: Also, I've learned the hard way recently to not worry about doing too many support tickets, if you are somehow doing too many they'll let you know.
[MTTS] davetaylor: That's in those annoying newbie tips, which are really useful when you start out, but annoying when you'v been hear years, but this made me think, is there a way to see all those newbie
tips, so that people who want a remind, or are new, can see them all?
[MTTS] something: Some of that stuff is really useful to newbies, but I'm pretty sure a bunch of them just ignore them by day two.
[MTTS] something: So yeah, I think it'd be really cool if they could all be put somewhere.
[MTTS] davetaylor: They are useful when you actually need them, hence my question.
[MTTS] aaronjw89: I've actually not paid much attention to them but I probably should've really. I've just kinda done my thing and hoped something came of it. Not that I want to push for things to happen
outside of staff plans, but I am wanting to be used!
[MTTS] Ulias: From the way I understand it, they actually encourage you to take character actions through the support tickets.
[MTTS] Ulias: Your character get super invovled in that way.
[MTTS] something: If the paragraph from the goals command was TLDR, it basicly says that it's not meant as a way to talk to staff, just as a way for you to keep your own notes that they can look through
if ever.
[Tactical Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "A-59 is clear."
[MTTS] alc_71: I think you can request they look at them from time to time. If there is something in there that they could help with.
[MTTS] Ulias: Also, type policy 14 if you haven't already.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great
view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around
with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table
to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.

provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Accord of Free Worlds Command; Docking Bay One.

[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
Welcome to Manhattan Spaceport! The entire place seems brand new, the glass sparkling, the plasteel gleaming. Starships arrive and depart while others sit on individual pads, rings of lights blinking
around them as they are recharged. Occasionally, the ground vibrates and the low rumble of heavy hydraulics is heard as a starship is brought up from the underground garage or lowered for extended parking
below. Around the huge landing pad, wide, arched doorways framed in brushed steel lead to various station services: Repair & Rearm to the northeast, Supply to the southeast, Station Security to the
southwest, and the Mail Room to the northwest. In addition, a classy lighted sign over one doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge.' You can GO into it. There is also a doorway marked 'Liaison Office' that you can
also GO into. Over the corridor to the south, another sign reads 'Spaceport Exit and Express Train.'
The two-person light transport "Registered Merchant 452", the four-person mule "That One Final Straw", and the eight-person prime defense mark two "I Brought This Cruiser To A Knife Fight" are landed
here.
You see an asteroid-shaped steel trash bin, a sanitation drone, and a sanitation drone here.

[Starship "Supernova"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Gamma.

[New Earth; Pilot Lounge]
This roomy, circular lounge sits on the very lip of the landing pad outside, with half of it suspended over the water below. Large transparisteel windows overlook the ocean at one end and afford a great
view of the landing pad at the other, the material tinting itself automatically when needed. The walls, tables, and floor are gleaming white lucite, kept immaculately clean by tiny drones that zip around
with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows, leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast flickers across the surface of each sleek white table
to keep the pilots informed of the latest goings-on. A stairway towards the back of the room has its door open and bears a sign reading 'Garage'.
You see a semi-circular bar, a public holovid, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, a shiny chrome trash bin, Cloak the security hoverbot, Dagger the security hoverbot, and a sanitation drone here.

A pair of odd-colored stars, one green and one blue, mark this curious area of space. The sensors are picking up odd bits of noise that the ship's computer insists on trying to convert to audio. Once in a

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark

A wormhole suddenly appears in front of the ship, its edges tinged an unusual deep purple. Strange undulating shapes are half-visible deep inside it.
A thick undulating mist suddenly seems to rush toward the starship from every direction, quickly blotting out the stars. Random shapes, some half-familiar, occasionally form in the mist only to disappear
almost immediately.
The starship has left a unique area of space.

[Starship "Critical Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport
provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control
board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses
overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who
will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is inside the riftflow.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a steel plaque engraved with the phrase "Reminder: This ship is equipped with a sensor dampening array.", a wormhole drive tracer, a black leather captain's chair, a dark

Subject: SEAS Thanks You
Author: Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident
Posted: 13:31 30 September 2317 GST

Thank you for allowing SEAS to contribute to Temporary Space Stations again. We're always here to lend a hand and to help promote the income of other pilots so that they can grow their quallifications and
skills as well as they're not heavily taxed when transferring or interacting with Alliance facilities.
I've built every area currently available and then some before so and I certainly understand the the level of extra work involved. Although I appreciate the opportunity to take a break from building, I
feel a little guilty that we're not building at the moment as we want to help. So if anyone needs for us to lend a hand when you need to be away, please let anyone from SEAS know. That is Shule Elemmire,
Constantine Stone, Tara Flores or myself.

"Thanks." Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles at you. "Hopefully some will get the real message rather than some idiots taking things out of context. Honestly, the income we receive is pretty minor for
me as compared to what I want to do for others. So when jerks like Erik spout off and say what they say, they are obviously, as I say not the brightest star in the universe and pretty ignorant."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Erik is controlling 288 so that's why we're not going on there but he will likely get bored with it in time. Not being included on 288 won't break our hearts nor our
banks as it's not consistent enough."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh because they get a lot more from that cluster over there."
Ather Jammoa says, "Not -that- much."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Which ball would that be..... Oh... THAT ball."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, the Outccord ball."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "As Morris put it yesterday, it's like we're just waiting for the ink to dry."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well wish we could make it disappear."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "At least.. um.. we'll get cool fighters I guess? hardly seems worth it thoguh."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "And.. sadly, it will only get worse."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "That's the only thing I know for sure that will happen after Outccord, we're supposed to get those fighters like the one Constantine was gifted."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Thing is. We've slowly been movin' this way since I've been a pilot. Which fuckin' sucks, but hindsight and all that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Cool fighter? For the destruction of an entire alliance? I fail to see the benifits..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, me either Johnothon."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yep i'll likely not accept mine if I get one or if I have to go buy it, I probably won't."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "That's fuckin' shitty."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's got six turrets, laser bonus, extra sotrage for torps, and FTL capable."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I would give up that new fighter, and pay for 100 of them just to stay in the accord, I'd probably pay more too."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Absolutely Kim."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'm drooooling."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "If it was about money, they'd probably take that deal."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's about regulations though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "HOw'd it get this bad though. I mean I've been gone for a while but there must've been a way to stop this."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I see no reason for not taking having the fighters. BUT that still doesn't give a /good/ reason to leave the accord."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "We tried for months to stop it, they've very determined though."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It happened when Best got elected. He always said this was what he was goign to do if he got elected."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Or... do the Accord 'rules' prevent us from having such awesome fighters?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "There's still time I guess, but it'd take a fuckin' miracle from what I see."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, and we do not have much of any bargaining power left."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's not really any time, the negotiations were actually supposed to be finished by now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They may already have been, and we just haven't heard."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Well, yeh, but it's not a negotiation if we've already left the table."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll bet we'll here about this starting the new term.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray sighs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll be taking bets... starting now..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well,  we were bound contractually to the Accord, so they can't just leave without breaching the agreement, hence the negotiations."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "That makes sense."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Hmm..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "When would the Contract close?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Or.. end."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "What does this mean with our position with the EAOS? I have a feelin' it's gonna effect that too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Run out.. what ever you call it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well.. I think it's been about a week since they said the negotiations would be finished within the week."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They've already stopped people from going to the EAOS, actually."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Well we're royally fucked."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Where do you mean?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Fienstein denounced his AEU citizenship over it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. renounced."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Can't blame him."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "So we're pretty much in charge of our own development, our own security, our own economy no help anywhere, and we're not well off to begin
with."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Yeah, that is about the short version of it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep, that's the way the people want it, apparently."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "B-b-but... what about all those amazing EAOS upgrades?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs sighs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "No idea about that, we may still be able to get upgrades, but none of our citiznes are being allowed to accept induction, that's all I meant."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Can we actually renounce our own citizenship and seek sanctuary in other places?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Seems like to me that's an option but a terrible one."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs sighs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I would not discuss that on this channel."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm not sayin' anyone's gonna do it, but it's a question to be asked."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I agree.. that is not a conversation for public channels like this..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "They're gonna kick out all the non-nationals too."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I mean we literally have folks jumpin' ship."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Are you serious?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "What... in the world.. are they trying to do?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, I read in the news about the peace keeping thing, what actually is that all about?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Yep. Anyone who wasn't born here I guess."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Become an issolated world?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "That counts me out. GOOOOOOOD bye... AEU."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I mean.... NEEEEW EARTH>."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Well, they are getting humanity destroyed, starting with us. That is what they are doing. They just don't see it that way, nor do they believe
it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "We're turnin' into...god we're turnin' into a militant society then. Like how are we gonna be any different than Fringe. I mean we're turnin'
into that without the accord. We're so fucked."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Uh... is Best an Outsider? Impersinating a human?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Sheesh..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "It's already kind of like that. At the protest, some folks came up adn threw rocks at us when Aisling showed up and the security guys just found
somewhere to lean and watch. Said we already looked beat up when they got there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "No, I do not believe our president is an outsider impersonating a human. But I do believe he underestimates the outsider threat, a lot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Clearly..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Heh, for a while, I kept having bad dreasms that he was an infiltrator robot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Er.. bad dreams."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's more than just that...it's literally him just sayin' we don't care about global politics we'll do it our own way..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "And who cares how bad of a position we're in."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "He's being overly stubburn and arrogant."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "We're gonna collapse there's no plans to do anythin' about it. Like what is the plan to keep us afloat."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Kim the peacekeeping is a Ground Combat thing. You can inquire at the security office."

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Lock and Load. Build a station of our own, out of New Earth Space.. call it the... uh... umm... I have a few names. But none that seem quite
fitting."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "So, has any of you undertaken that responsibility?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Grays.. I can buy you a drink. I need one myself."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "A few have. I haven't. Initially we didn't do anything but it is essentially being sent to places like Hyperion to scan around
the streets for militants and so on."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm not fuckin' doin' that. I'm not. Fuckin' motherfuck. This is bat shit."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "We protested it because it's not our job to police."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Personally, I will not be doing those. I'm not gonna go clomp through the streets in a battlesuit scaring people, just for the sake of trying to stop
a few bad ones. The police should be able to handle it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.. it's 5 to ten minutes there. Patrol around. Scan everything. Get out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "I would,  if I felt like it was called for."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Fuck that shit and light it on goddamn fire! Fuck that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Pfft... some people just ignore you. Like they don't care you're even there."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Besides... why not look cool and awesome in a battlesuit to the people?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yes same here but we were absolutely not trained in Law Enforcement. Defense of humanity, yes but we're not police."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "This makes me sick."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Well, maybe you are right. I just know it would freak me out to see a war machine clomping around the town."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rahab Cassidy transmits, "It doesn't send the best message to the civilians, I should think."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "We are not police indeed. And a battlesuit may look pretty, but it's not really a toy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "From what I heard from our Voice though, things are apparently worse over there than we've been told in the news."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If it is made a common day thing... people won't think anything of it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Exactly."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's just the government tryin' to have us inforce their agenda and I'mnot havin' it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Johnathon I'm goin' to the lounge."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Gee, we blow up rats, bari and outsider enforcer drones with weapons on those suits, and now we get sent in them to spot some of our fellow human
beings, and do what exactly?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah and a battle suit isn't designed to go into crowd or other type of human law enforcement. It's here for dealing with
non-human beings and entities."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "Or for people in similar battlesuits, I suppose."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah well I doubt we'd encounter many others in battlesuits."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "There is no current orders to cause harm to any citizen. At of which, I personally would frown upon.... unless we have stun guns made
available to us. But... that better come with some police training and turn us from civilian pilots to police."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Kim Saunders transmits, "I am not going for that. Then I will retrain for something else."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "There doesn't need to be I go down the street in a paladan with an explodin' harpoon and no one is gonna do anythin' to that without startin'
destruction everywhere."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I'll be on new earth in a minute."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Me likewise. I didn't go to the university to study Law Enforcement."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Nor to the pilot academy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "From what Iunderstand, there are no targets, just patrolling. But still, the people there may not know that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yeah.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "They don't have a clue as to why we're there."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah still, I am concerned about their adding other responsibilities."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But.. that's a guess."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Likewise, Lily."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I feel like we're missin' the point here, just by patrollin' the streets in some martial law deal we're doin' that. It's fucked and it's sends
the message that if ya fuckin' rebel we'll use our own technology on ya."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Nope."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um, hey you don't have to tell me, I have been fighting this stuff for months."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Exactly and it insults me as GSL to even be able to acknowledge thisias a type of work for us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "WE're not the navy... so it can't be martial Law."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "It's a damned fine line..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Only reason I'm not now, is because I made a horrible mistake and was almost charged with terrorism. I had to agree not to make anymore calls to
action and whatnot."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray grunts.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Yeah I supose we're all supposed to be bound but I just will not sell out."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "I like to think of it as keeping tabs on what is going on.. or is asked."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "I'm not gonna just be silenced. I can't be I just...I just can't fuckin' be."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's a news break about it Jonathan, as well as a butt-ton of headlines."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Like I said, it's a very damned fine line that they are playing. Don't want to give the impression that it's martial law.. but.. at the same
time. It's a means of keeping a 'peacefull' presense.."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's them doin' it without them callin' it martial law."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "There's not a line, it's just callin' it somethin' else."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "If it was "martial law" the navy would be doing it. Not us."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Exactly, that's the only difference."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "The navy are the ones who hand out the missions."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Heh yeah I'd call it martial law because you don't go parading around in something as formidable as a battlesuit to scare
innocent citizens."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "But.. no.. they send us, so they can avoid the... bad press."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has received 210,000.31 EAOS credits from a toll payment to League Rift Accelerating Battery-Powered Toll Station in The Belt of
Orion.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "Exactly. We're hated already, so it's no loss to public image."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Right."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "There's no such thing as bad press anymore, when it comes to Union news outlets."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "TOOOO true."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Union News outlets should be added to the game of horrible people..."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Um... ok, Iknow this is a serious conversation, but that was funny right there."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I just can't laugh about that."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey transmits, "Neither can I, but I can see the humor."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Well I can sort of but all of this is just dark dark and despairing."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Jonathan Gray transmits, "It's not funny at all."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes it is, Lily. It is very despairing."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "I wish we had another member to support in SEAS for another cruiser as we'll probably need a lot of what we can muster when
Outsiders come back."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident transmits, "Thankfully we have two and room for a third which will probably go to Constantine if he can get back from his detail to finish
his qualification."
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Nest?"
[Tactical Communication] Johnathon Triggs transmits, "Yes."
[AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We've met our first tier performance goal! Let's keep pushing for the second!"
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Anyone else?"
Johnathon Triggs walks in from the north.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident waves to Johnathon Triggs.
Johnathon Triggs waves.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Hmm... site almost complete."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Nice."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.
Johnathon Triggs says, "First site... just over 5.9 mil.. and 5 points."
Lily says to Johnathon, "Ok just so you know, if you leave before conquest end, until we cleanse this area, you won't be able to get back in so you might want to try to stay until it is completed."
Johnathon Triggs says, "It's done."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident cheers for Johnathon Triggs!
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well mine is taking awhile because I had so much ore! So I will hang-in with it."
Johnathon says to Lily, "Ah.. that's why I couldn't approach here, before now.."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."
Johnathon Triggs says, "Well.. till we took out some of the bari."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "That is why we have to cleanse it to get it reopened."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "I switched to lasers. So, as soon as the next conquest starts. Count me in on cleansing the place of bari."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You can start another before conquest but again you need to stay with it even after conquest ends if you want to complete it."
Johnathon Triggs says, "I need more ground time, anyways."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I've started a few just before conquest end and gotten that dividend."
Johnathon Triggs glances down at his watch momentarily.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident glances around at her surroundings.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Could almost have a deployment station set up here.. just to help keeping it clear."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Well that would be nice!"
Johnathon says to Lily, "Might recommending it?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "But I can't tell you what an effort it was to finally get them to allow us to open it up. We came here repeatedly and cleansed but they wouldn't open it."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "When they did, we were all ecstatic!"
Johnathon Triggs exclaims, "That's good!"
Johnathon Triggs asks, "Imagine what benefits could be produced with a deployment station set up here?"
Johnathon Triggs says, "Would be one more step closer to have this place cleared."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah well it's hard to get them to budge on our behalf or what they perceive to be on our behalf even though this brings a lot of industrial material into the
government."
Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Think I need to improve my industry a bit, before I start another site."
Johnathon Triggs says, "Just to get more out of it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Naa just keep at it as you'll always earn something."
Johnathon Triggs says, "That last site took me about 2 and half hours.."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When I was a new pilot, I made it my goal to always complete the two allowed mining sites per day."
A metallic gold touch einrophone beeps quietly for attention, indicating a new post in General/Name Changes.
A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator chimes softly as it receives a new notice.
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs switches a message board reader on and peers at the screen.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Because you get some nice cash out of these for things you need."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon says to Lily, "It's actually very enjoyable..."
Johnathon Triggs says, "Though... in 3 hours... I'll be honest.. I could make more right now doing tesla runs."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "The mining points you earn also help towards better sites and yes you'll need to earn theindustry to obtain upgrades and eventually the first license which I think is
at 500 points?"
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "It is, 500."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Johnathon says to Lily, "Right now, too, I need to focus earning the points.. rather than the Creds... so I might be able to find a part i've been looking for.. with no luck."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Which part?"
Johnathon says to Lily, "Oh.. just some random old part.."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Do you have a name for it? I can't really tell you specifically. However if yo know what it is, I probably can tell you where it's likely to be found."
Johnathon Triggs says, "It's an old jinu part. I've looked high an low.. in all directions. But.. it eludes me."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "Which project is this for?"
Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Johnathon Triggs says, "A research project I believe.."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Hmm well that might pop out there in space soemwhere."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.
Johnathon Triggs nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Johnathon says to Lily, "Having autovector might help."
Johnathon Triggs says, "Sooo... tedious with out it."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Always be vigilent with that starmap."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or observing what's in the sectors."
Johnathon Triggs says, "I've flown through... hmm... over a couple dozen sectors.. watching the starmaps.. or the rundowns.. but, nothing."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh it will likely involve considerably more."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I don't suggest sectors with beacons in them."
Johnathon says to Lily, "Oh, I don't mean beaconed sectors.. I mean sectors that are uncharted and unbeaconed... nothing but you.. space.. and RATS."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah it can be a stubborn item to find, no doubt!"
Johnathon Triggs says, "Been searching in my cargo hauler, just because it has some longer lasting battery power."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Makes a big difference between 2.5 hours and 5 or 6 hours."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It sure does."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.
Johnathon Triggs removes a charge booster from a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Johnathon Triggs.
Johnathon Triggs says, "If.. that's not enough. I got a backup."
Johnathon Triggs grins.
Johnathon Triggs puts a charge booster in a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Or... can simply put one together... If in case I need one more."
Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes I'm glad you carry those. So many newer pilots get in a big jamb because they don't think of the need to carry those with them."
Johnathon Triggs says, "But.. but.. but.. want.. need autovector."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "By the way... what's a hatch repair kit for?"
Johnathon Triggs says, "Don't hear many ships have their hatch breached."
Johnathon Triggs says, "Or.. any tools around that can do so."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You'll need 300 industry though and I don't think that you can earn that much until you have your application approved."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or did they change it? I have no idea anymore."
Johnathon says to Lily, "Thought it was 200."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope not for autovector."
Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "200 is for the navaid and jet."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "What was it for 200?"
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Right."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "What's the Navid?"
Johnathon Triggs says, "Navaid."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "It detects artifacts?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You need the navigational aid when you are spacewalking so that you can gage your location and look out for other ships and things in the sector."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Ah. Ok."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Then the jet keeps you more stable or you will have a very difficult time moving."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If you ever got to go over to Helios into the mall over there, there's no gravity."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Like.. drydock."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Or over on Drydock as well."

You wave to Johnathon Triggs.
Johnathon Triggs waves to you.
Johnathon says to Lily, "Bet you i'll be on the top preformers list this time through."
Johnathon Triggs chuckles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yay."
grin
You grin.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I honestly have no idea how I even placed last time. The only work I did was a skirmish or two but I didn't do any other work."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "Though... I should try to finish off one more low deployment.. maybe?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Sure!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "I used to do all of mine every conquest."
'It certainly couldn't hurt unless you get blow up.
You say, "It certainly couldn't hurt unless you get blow up."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "There will be a time when you can't."
Johnathon says to Lily, "I'm surprised I didn't rank up there. I did a bit before it ended.."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah please try not to explode!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We at least made it to our first goal."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
'Nice!
You exclaim, "Nice!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's been weeks."
Johnathon says to you, "THere's been once that I was close to blowing up... was hating that I switched from chains to lasers on the rental."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yep."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Lasers at that level are pretty weak."
Johnathon Triggs says, "I need to get a laser booster."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "They are."
'true
You say, "True."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "What's the next stronger laser?"
Johnathon Triggs says, "Strongest.."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well when you do Tesla missions, once you start drawing poachers, you will occasionally get one to drop a module for you."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Nice."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Also as you know on nests as well."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Johnathon Triggs says, "I got my evasion one from a tiny nest, with the SVP>."
grin
You grin.
Johnathon Triggs exclaims, "I was like.. oh, look! Gold!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah those drop modules sometiems too."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
grin
You grin.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So always always do as many of the sVP as you can as trust me it will end when you achieve a certain number of industry."
'Yeah
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "And ground."
You say, "Yeah."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "Hmm.. currently have 30 tesla points.. at what point do the poachers start coming?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "250 Ground."
nod
You nod.
Johnathon Triggs says, "Ah."
Johnathon Triggs asks, "So enjoy the quite walks of the mines till then.. huh?"
Johnathon Triggs grins.
'exactly
You say, "Exactly."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yes and enjoy that peace haha."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Those poachers can be a bit caustic."
Johnathon Triggs nods.
chuckle
You chuckle.
Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chortles.
Johnathon Triggs asks, "What was the points required for tier 2 Rental?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I have no idea it's been too long!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
laugh 'Me neither.
You laugh. "Me neither."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Probably around 500? I don't know."
Johnathon says to Lily, "What good GSL you are."
Johnathon Triggs grins at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
chuckle
You chuckle.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Well I don't have a photographic memory about some aspects."
Johnathon Triggs says, "Thought I heard lower..."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident chuckles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Nope I think it's only for tier 1."
Johnathon Triggs gets a distant look on his face as he ponders.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You're lucky it's not tier 3."
Johnathon says to Lily, "Hmm?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Tier 3 for our suit is 750."
Johnathon Triggs sighs.

A black laminate filing cabinet is already open.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "So typically for another alliance or other suit it would be higher than that."
