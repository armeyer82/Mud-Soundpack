Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service
robot, and a compact white refrigerator here.
Lily Kaise is sleeping on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.

[New Earth; Spaceport Bridge]
This clean white bridge spans the gap between the spaceport proper to the west
and the landing pad to the east. Hundreds of feet below you, the blue waters of
Hawking Bay lap against the bridge's support beams in a rhythmic pattern. The
bridge itself is constructed of concrete gracefully shaped into smooth, curving
lines, with new silver railings and bushy green potted plants set out at
intervals to enhance the aesthetic appeal of the structure. Though pilots and
travelers often hurry through the area, many others pause at the railings to
enjoy the fine view of their surroundings. A small archway leads to a set of
concrete steps leading all the way down to the water.
You see a trash can and a long white plasteel bench here.
Eli Grey is sitting on a long white plasteel bench. Lily Kaise is standing here.

A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Eli says to Lily, "Would a different time be better?"
'Neither can I, but I'll do my best.
You say, "Neither can I, but I'll do my best."
A sanitation drone briefly emits a mechanical rumbling that sounds much like a
groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.
Lily Kaise says, "Im generally here after 2300 and sometimes as late as 2330."
Eli Grey asks, "Ah, so maybe midnight would be better?"
Lily Kaise says, "It would."

along a horizontal surface, then studies the result.

Lily Kaise says, "'ok."

Eli Grey says, "It will be a brief broadcast, probably less than thirty minutes,

Eli Grey asks, "Can you guys spread the word? Quietly for now, of course?"
Lily Kaise says, "I am glad it's tomorrow but the next day I won't likely be

A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into a small archway leading to a set
of concrete steps.
Eli Grey says, "Ah, then we'll be doing it just in time."
Lily says to Eli, "Might put a note on General?"
Lily Kaise asks, "Or you don't want to go that public?"
Eli Grey says, "I will, but I will wait till tomorrow for that, the less time
they have to prepare a responde, the better."
Eli Grey says, "Er.. a response."
Lily Kaise nods.

checked."

all believe just the opposite."

using Bests name if posible. If we do that the folks who support him will simply
shut the holo off. We need to get through to th em as well."
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods east.
Lily Kaise says, "I don't mind epressing my thoughts right here. Just as ather
shut me out of the other statement about the crimes towards others. I was in
support of that statement as well but it gave all of the haters like Aisling and
Anfisa something which was totally wrong."
Eli Grey nods to Lily Kaise.
Eli Grey says, "You won't be shut out on this. This concerns all of us."
Eli Grey says, "I don't intend to be that kind of Voice."
Evangeline Adaire glides in from the west.

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "HWhatcha need?"
Lily Kaise says, "I just didn't want to face the redicule of two individuals who
are kim Saunders and Ather Jammoa who didn't express a single word that I should
come back into comms until it dawned on them that the AEU wasn't looking very
good yet I came back within a day. I wasn't aboard my own ship and I would have
had we not been headed to get johann's upgrade on Tom town."
Eli Grey speaks into his metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator:

Eli says to Evangeline, "I'm doing a public broadcast toorrow night. Iw ould

don't ant to but just being there will show support."
Evangeline smiles and leans back against a long white plasteel bench.
Eli Grey says, OOCly, "Ugh my stupid keyboard."
Evangeline nods her head, smiling. "I'll be there. Thank you Eli." She raises a
hand to press it to her hair.
Eli says to Evangeline, "It's concerning the Union pulling out of the Accord. A
sort of last ditch effort to reach the people about it."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Evangeline says to you, "I know. I don't like it."
A sanitation drone pulls out a cloth and a container of some liquid, then
spritzes and wipes seemingly random surfaces.

'We all don't like it.
You say, "We all don't like it."
Lily Kaise asks, "Eva did anyone show you the sttement we sent via Kim to the
liaison?"
Evangeline Adaire asks, "And Best just thinks we agree on it?"
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods into a small archway leading to a set
of concrete steps.
Eli Grey says, "We've all already tried it through the official channels and
it's doen no good. So it's time to make our voices heard."
Lily Kaise says, "Absolutely."
"I agree." Evangeline Adaire nods. "And no, I do not believe anyone showed me."
Eli says to Evangeline, "He knows we don't. He just doesn't care."

Shule nods emphatically.
Evangeline nods her head, frowning slightly. "I see." she says with a soft sigh,
tugging at her hair.
Lily Kaise removes a small sparkly light purple portfolio from a lavender silk

Lily Kaise removes a small black leather portfolio from a lavender silk backpack

groan, then extends a broom attachment and sweeps the area.
Evangeline Adaire asks, "I know the mutuality does not like us, but if we become
separated from the accord, waht will happen to us as a whole?"
Eli says to Evangeline, "I honestly do not know. I suppose there's a possiblity
of getting rogued, but I highly doubt it. There will be no doubt that we have
only the Union's best intentions at heart."
Eli says to Evangeline, "Oh, you mean that."
Lily Kaise removes a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the
desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" from a small black leather portfolio.
A sanitation drone turns and slowly plods west.
Evangeline nods her head. "I do. Yes."
Eli Grey says, "Well, to be honest, that will likely be fine. We'll still be
able to do all the things we do now. But pulling out will only weaken the Accord
and the AEU, and that's a disaster."
Lily says to Evangeline, "Ok this is my only copy but here read this."
Lily Kaise gives a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the
desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" to Evangeline Adaire.
Evangeline nods her head and takes the paper, reading it over before she
responds to anything else.
Eli says to Evangeline, "You'll still be able to buy upgrades and fly with other
pilots. No worries about that."
Lily Kaise says, "'yep we'll just lose points and be frowned on by the
government but we must do what is right."
Shaking her head, braid tinkling, Evangeline nods distracted to a thin gray
filtration mask as she reads, commenting, "My biggest concern is what will
happen to us as a whole."
Lily Kaise nods.
Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.
Evangeline Adaire asks, "Lose points? Truly?"
Lily Kaise says, "Yep."
Evangeline shakes her head and purses her lips.
Lily Kaise says, "Roguing does take away a bit of status."
Eli Grey says, "I doubt we will lose points. But I won't completely discredit
that possiblity."
Evangeline chuckles. "I do not think it will come to rogue."
Lily Kaise says, "Well others have in the past I guess it depends upon the
severety of their punishment of us."
Eli Grey says, "Best will not be happy, but rogueing us will only add weight to
our words."
Lily Kaise says, "Sure will."
Eli Grey nods.
nod
You nod.
Eli Grey says, "This is why I don't want to make it about him either. This neds
to only be about the Union pulling out of the Accord, nothing else. My speech
doesn't mention Best one time."
Evangeline nods her head as she hands a sheet of white stationery with a header
reading "From the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" back to Lily. "There you
are. I'll be there if time permits. It will be at midnight, you say?"
Evangeline Adaire gives a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From
the desk of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" to Lily Kaise.
Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.
Eli Grey smiles.
Lily Kaise says, "It's all right. I stand by my commitment to do what is right
and truly right by our citizens."
Evangeline nods to a thin gray filtration mask.
Evangeline Adaire says, "Alright."
Lily Kaise puts a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk
of Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa" in a small black leather portfolio.
Eli Grey says, "I wil not hold it against any of you if decide to back out."
Lily Kaise says, "Heh I sure won't."
Eli Grey smiles at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise puts a small black leather portfolio in a lavender silk backpack
embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.
'I won't.
You say, "I won't."
Evangeline nods her head. "Thank you for bringing this to my attention."
Eli says to Evangeline, "Absolutely."
Evangeline Adaire stands up from a long white plasteel bench.
Evangeline Adaire asks, "Who all do you think will be there?"
Eli Grey says, "Hopefully,  everyone. I still need to talk to Constatine, and
Vernos."
Evangeline nods her head. "Fair enough. Thank you."
Eli Grey says, "Ather will likely not be able to make it."
Eli Grey shrugs.
Eli Grey says, "He's done enough already."
Lily Kaise says, "Wow that is unfortunate."
"He never is able to make it." Evangeline murmurs. "As long as we have his
support."
Eli Grey grins at Evangeline Adaire.
Evangeline smiles.
Eli Grey says, "Well, he did draft that document, so that helps."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says, "That's true so I know it doesn't mean he isn't behind this."
Evangeline nods her head. "This is true. If Best goes through with it anyway,
then we should say that he is not looking at the union's interest as a whole."
Eli Grey says, "Try to be there at least half an hour earlier if you can, even
just a few minutes. So that we can get our ducks in a row, as they say."
A sanitation drone lumbers into the area.
Evangeline Adaire says, "If you will excuse me, however, I have some work to
do."
Evangeline Adaire nods.
Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.
Lily Kaise says, "Yeah will do my best."
Eli says to Evangeline, "Thanks for your time."
Lily Kaise says, "Ugh."
Evangeline Adaire says, "I will most likely not speak, as I am not good with
public speaking as a whole."
Lily Kaise says, "I will make the utmost effort to be there."
'As will I.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and
has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a pretty purple halterneck top with a ruffled neckline, a pair
of tight light blue denim jeans with a small dark-red 'XX' embroidered on the
back left pocket, and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing
an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet
of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted
chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of
silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a
pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple
reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a
perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled
'Asteria'. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both shoulders, back, both biceps,
both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

You say, "As long as you feel satisfied, I'm happy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "I very much doubt
it's a theory. It's weird. First you claimed not to have sent a letter, and now
you're saying that it's just a theory?"
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "What's going on here?
Vernos you keep making all of these random statements."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "But, if you want to
resort to childish behavior instead of doing the right thing, well, that's all o
nyou. You'll just go down into the embarrassment files like the slavers."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I sent a letter
about a theory I had, that I had discussed with another pilot because the timing
looked suspecious. I refuse to be beat on by pilots on that trip until it is
determined I am incorrect."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Sounds to me like
you're just throwing a tantrum cause youw eren't invited."
Lily Kaise grins at you.

just congratulate you for being the new village idiot. Hope it's a good throne
to be on for now. Enjoy!"

You say to Lily, "I'll never do activites you are uncomfortable with. And yes,
he is."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Know what I think. I
think I'm onto something and a lot of really vetern pilots are getting

[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Personally, I doubt
you folks would be so defensive if there was nothing to it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "You're acting like
the president you ended up not voting for. Since you too don't seem to care
about the things Frolov said to Best regarding human life."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Calling names, going
around and saying stupid and village idiot."

Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Heh I have nothing to
be defensive over. I'm just annoyed with your random bullshit and the fact that
you did something rather obtuse and very questionable really clearly indicates
that you yourself has more to defend."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Human life is
valuable, but theft is theft and if it is true then laws hold value too."

start caring about upholding League law?"
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yes Ather get this
shithead out of here for awhile."
Lily Kaise laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I'm pretty sure
theft is against the law in any alliance."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "So is aligning yourself
with pirates."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "If theft was
committed to take those parts, they were not stolen from the AEU. Therefore, no
crime was committed against the AEU. Which means that you're only pursuing
something like this out of pure spite."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Precisely."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I persued it because
I think my theory holds weight regardless of alliance."
Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Whoah."
Lily Kaise says, "Man he is just um."
'Wow
You say, "Wow."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I think there is
something there and I think all of you on that trip are trying to hide
something."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Eli Grey transmits,
"Arlight, You've both said your piece, now that's enough."
'I'm not one for strading pilots, but he's annoying me enough that it's

You say, "I'm not one for strading pilots, but he's annoying me enough that it's
temptingme."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Which would make you
a lot more like the slavers than I."
'Stranding
You say, "Stranding."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Okay I'm done Eli,
hes not worth my time."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "Na, it wouldn't make
me like the slavers. I actually helped arrange the means to help a group of
people survived. They traded them into situations where they would've most
likely died."
Lily says to you, "Yeah and if you need help, bring me and i'll let Magellan
have a party on him."
grin lily
You grin at Lily Kaise.
Lily Kaise says, "In fact, I think we should call him out and take him
somewhere."
Lily Kaise says, "I bet nobody would pick him up either."
Lily Kaise laughs.
'Oh, Eve might.
You say, "Oh, Eve might."
Lily Kaise asks, "Who?"
'She that much against stranding. Evenia.
You say, "She that much against stranding. Evenia."
Lily Kaise says, "Well we oculd let her know that we had business to take care
of. I am too but we have to manage our own sometimes."
nod
You nod.
Lily Kaise says, "Where's that pancakes place? I should know because heh I was
stranded there one time and I need to fetch a ship I put over ther too and sell
that thing."
Lily Kaise laughs.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Voice of the Corps Eli Grey transmits, "The
League has been informed of it, it's being handled by them, as it should be.
Now,  no more about this on this channel. If you two want to go duke it out in a
field somewhere that's your peroggative, but I don't want to hear anymore about
this on public channels."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Ather Jammoa transmits, "As long as Vernos
stops trying his "oh my gosh I accidentally sent that letter" and actually owns
up to his idiocy I'm generally good."

enjoy our intimacy.
You say to Lily, "The most important thing to me is that you are happy and
comfortable and enjoy our intimacy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "The more you all act
this way about it, the more I grow even more confident that I am onto something.
We will get along fine, just stay out of my way and if I am wrong at the end of
everything then I will eat the crow and bite the bullet."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Tell your little
Aisling that too please."
Lily Kaise smiles at you.
Lily says to you, "I so do. I just wish I could manage more time for it and I
promise you I will work on that Love. I so want to please you and especially in
a manner that you enjoy."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "Oh and I'll add this
before I quit since Eli asked nicely. If my theory had no weight at all, you
guys would just go about your business and not be all ruffled as if trying to
hide it."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Eli Grey sighs.
Lily Kaise says, "Heh who has anything to hide but Vernos. I am still very
concerned and baffled over that incident in 777 yesterday."

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, a compact white refrigerator,
Purr the humanoid service robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.
You can go south and out.

Evangeline Adaire asks, "Alright... Where is the backdrop?"
Eli says to Evangeline, "We're going to show the citizens of the AEU the power
of the Outsiders. Show them that it's not a threat that can be dealt with by any
one single alliance."
Eli points to the broadcast booth, "It's in there. we won't be allowed in until
two minutes before the time slot.
Evangeline nods her head slowly. "Alright. I can get behind that."
[Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained

Eli Grey says, "Don't worry, nothing is going to happen to you guys. I won't be
saying anything slanderous."
Sighing, Evangeline looks a bit befuddled, though shakes her head a moment later
at Eli's assessment. 'No it's all right." she murmurs, fidgeting and messing
with a space imaging photograph of Experimental Research Structure Station for a
moment.
Eli Grey says, "And my hope is, that if you folks don't speak, then you will be
safer from being rogued or anything of that nature. Even if we get rogued I
doubt it will last very long."
"And you think that you will be rogued for speaking your mind?" Evangeline asks,
a little tiredly.
Eli Grey says, "I highly doubt anything will happen to us though. If it does I
will take full responsibility."
Evangeline Adaire says, "You should not have to take full responsibility."
Eli says to Evangeline, "I have no idea what Best will do."
Evangeline Adaire says, "Apparently he won't be on his Best behavior either."

Eli Grey says, "I don't think that anyone will be able to stop this broadcast,

sure."
Evangeline chuckles. "It will be hell if you aren't there and we are standing
there staring at the camera's."

that make me want to sshake him and tell him to learn his place."
Eli Grey says, "I didn't want to exclude anyone, but yeah, it's too risky to let
him in."
Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.
Evangeline Adaire says, "I thought you were the one who was working with him? He
thinks changing the alliance can be done in a day. It cannot."
Evangeline Adaire says, "And yes, he kept arguing with Cheri even when I told
him to drop it. He can't keep his mouth shut."
Eli Grey says, "I was trying to work with him, but things have changed I guess.
I'm not really sure what his actual agenda is. He's all over the place with how
he feels about stuff."
Eli Grey says, "One second he's telling me that everyone needs to be
investigated, and the enxt he's asking me to write to Cheri and explain what he
really said and so forth. Not really sure what his game is."
Evangeline nods her head and frowns a little, sighing as she takes a breath, as
if to speak, though thinks better of it and silences herself. finally, she just
nods. "I don't know what to think about him, to be honest. I think sometimes
he's with us, and sometimes he's just against everyone."
Eli Grey nods to Evangeline Adaire.
Eli Grey says, "I had high hopes for him, I really did."
Eli Grey shrugs helplessly.

has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely
calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her
face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are
lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth.
Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her
mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick
fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small
enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a long-sleeved pale blue silk blouse with a shawl collar, a slim
navy blue natural silk skirt, and a pair of strappy navy blue silk sandals. She
is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a
slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple
wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a
delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a metallic gold
touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, and an
elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond. Her head, face,
both eyes, neck, both wrists, both hands, both knees, both calves, and both

can. thank you to those who have tuned in to hear what we have to say."
Eli Grey says, "We may not all agree on everything all of the time, but there's
one thing we all have in common, we all want what is best for our beloved Union.
As we speak, the AEU is making plans to withdraw completely from the Accord of
Free Worlds, and despite what has been in the news lately, nearly every member
of the pilot corps believes this is not a good plan of action for the Union."

Eli holds up a sheet of white stationery with a header reading "From the desk of
Robot Ace Pilot Ather Jammoa", and says "this is a document that was sent to our
government highlighting the reasons the Accord is necessary for us and indeed,
all of humanity. It was signed by every member of the corps that was present at
a meeting held on July first. I will not subject you to a full reading of this
document, but allow me to summarize. if anyone would like to read the full
document for themselves, it will be made available on request. It describes the
importance of the Accord and it's functions. the intel , research, and
technology that the Accord provides is invaluable to the survival of humanity
and of course, the Union. indeed we would not all be here even today without the
breakthroughs of their scientists, including scientists of the Unionn, and the
vigilance of those who keep watch over human space."
Eli Grey says, "The threat that we face is great, it remains as the biggest
threat to humankind that there has ever been. Make no mistake that,  no matter
the strength of the Union, this is not a threat that any one alliance can handle
on it's own. We pilots assist our great military in defending your lives, your
homes, and your families. However we have only been able to do so successfuly
due to the assistance that the Accord provides. Let us not forget the power of
our enemy."
Eli gestures to his fellow pilots.

Eli Grey says, "These are images of what remains after the Outsider attacks
during the war. Events that we remember all too well. For many years now the
Accord has staved off such attacks and worked towards finding new ways to defend
humanity, and to one day, take the fight to the Outsiders themselves."
Eli Grey says, "To members of the Union, pay special note to that image of
destroyed starships. This is what is left of the new earth 40th. This is what
happens when an aliance fleet must face an Outisder one without the aid of the
Accord and other alliance fleets."
Eli allows the images to linger for a moment longer before continuing.
Eli nods solemnly and says, "this is the power of our enemy. an enemy that can
destroy mighty stations and whole worlds with a single weapon. an enemy that
cares not if you are Union, League, Fringe, or Mutuality. an enemy that wants
only one thing... the complete annihilation of every single human, the
extinction of our entire species. the threat of pirates and other threats pales
in comparison. what price can possibly be placed on the protection of
humankind?"

[Chetumal Spaceport; Landing Pad]
Carved out of the top of one of the old mountains north of Chetumal City, the
landing pad of this spaceport has an unmatched panoramic view of the
countryside. A low cliff shelters it on the north side, with mail, security, and
repair facilities built into it, and recent construction efforts have expanded
the area and given it a sleek new look. The pad itself consists of a patchwork
of heavy plasteel panels bordered by beams of lighted steel, the panels
variously sized to accommodate any model of starship, no matter how large or
small. A modern but somewhat noisy hydraulic system moves starships between the
landing pad and the garage below. On the south side of the pad is the pilot
lounge with large, tinted windows overlooking the fine Chetumalian landscape to
the south. You can GO into its sleek glass-framed doorway. There is also a
doorway here marked 'Liaison Office,' which you can also GO into. A doorway to
the south leads to the Salvage Reclamation Project Center, and a wide metal
stairway leads down into lower levels of the spaceport.

fighter, we started to crew before intervening so we could fight better.

did. We thought he was going to be a good thing, but now he's taking away our

your job over your conscience? Really?"
Sarah says to Morris, "Scuse me just a minute, I need the nearest potty chair."
Nissi Valdaire says, "I probably woulda voted for Garner and then tried to take
action and prove him wrong about the corps. Or Rebane, just cuz she had her plan
doesn't mean it definitely would've happened if it'd been fought. She's not
insane like Best."

super ass long vacation, but what can you do?"
Morris Corlew nods to Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident.
Morris Corlew says, "Sorry, but if we get options to elect a president, and the
best one for the League wants to cut my job and the worst one wants to save it?

"Ok. Good."
Evangeline Adaire, Phoenix Dissident says, "The AEU program is open again. For
however long that is, I will be greatful, but it is open again. There was a time
we only had three pilots at one time. I'mg lad the prgram is opened back up
again, though with this latest blow... I don't know... I'm thinking out loud, at
least. It means more people who can fight for what's right, and if we can get
people... other people to back us, then it would be worth it. You all back us
and we are so proud of you for helping us... And support. Thank you."
