00:42:07 [General Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Cool Count me in."

00:42:10 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
00:42:10 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, and Purr the humanoid service robot here.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

00:42:12  You are wearing a long-sleeved dark green tee appliqued with small silver stars, a pair of blue corduroy jeans, and a pair of washed light khaki canvas sneakers. Underneath this, you are wearing a pair of white cotton briefs and a pair of white socks. You are also wearing a keychain, a backpack, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a black leather phone holster, a solid silver ring engraved with dolphins, and a gold wrist-mounted chronometer. You are concealing a metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator, a leather briefcase, a flight control scanner, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, a scorched metal thigh holster, a golden Feng Wo coin purse, a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets, a camera bag, a black engineering tool case, and a black flightbag with a red shooting star on the side. Your head, face, both eyes, neck, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.

00:42:12 You are carrying nothing.

00:42:16 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Excellent pincer time."

00:42:28 You scramble to your feet.

00:42:29 [Starship "William Dove"; Airlock]
You see a large secure xenology storage container, a row of flightlockers, an early warning space defense device, a glossy sky blue ceramic felo chow bowl, and KitCat the humanoid service robot here.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:42:29 You exit the ship.

00:42:30 [New Earth; Piper Wincott Memorial Garage]
You can go up.

00:42:32 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]

00:42:32 You can go out and enter into the ship.
You hear a sharp click as the ship's hatch is locked.

00:42:33 [Starship "Firestorm"; Control Room]

00:42:34 You see a black leather captain's chair, a decoy beacon launcher, a bioaugmentation plant in a small pot labeled "Space Invaders", and a wormhole drive tracer here.
You can go south, up, and out.

00:42:34 You grasp a large lever on the control board and push it slowly away from you.

00:42:34 Status lights blink on all around you as faint hums and beeps begin to emanate from the various starship systems.

00:42:35 You use the ship's radio to ask flight control for launch clearance.

00:42:38 You sit down on a black leather captain's chair.

00:42:40 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Firestorm, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."

00:42:41 You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

00:42:43 The ship is already moving.

00:42:48 The ship is already moving.

00:42:49 The ship is already moving.

00:42:50 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

00:42:51 The computer says, "Destination selected. Two jumps to Old Earth Orbit. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

00:42:51 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:42:52 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Earthgate."

00:42:55 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:42:57 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:42:58 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:42:58 Earthgate Station dominates space here, acting as a watchpost for the approach to Old Earth.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. One jump remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

00:42:59 The computer says, "Final convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Old Earth Orbit."

00:43:00 The starship vibrates slightly as it nears the wormhole mouth.

00:43:02 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

00:43:03 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

00:43:03 Old Earth turns below you, blue and green and brown and white. The planet elicits a feeling of "home" in almost all who view it, even if they have never actually set foot on it.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically proceed to Old Earth in thirty seconds unless aborted or another navigation order is entered."

00:43:06 Via general sector communication, Old Earth transmits, "Greetings, Firestorm! Welcome to Old Earth Orbit!"

00:43:06 AutoStar detects 3 possible destinations.  Assembling destination list.  Please wait.

00:43:07 A destination appears on the ship's navigation controls: Old Earth.

00:43:10 You detect a faint rumbling as the starship begins to move through space.

00:43:45 The sound of the engines slowly fades away as the starship stops moving.

00:43:46 The ship's computer automatically requests landing clearance.

00:43:51 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "We detect you to be an AEU ship, Firestorm. The League welcomes you under the non-aggression pact."

00:43:51 You feel mild acceleration as the ship descends toward a planet.

00:44:00 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of gravity as the ship touches down smoothly on the planet's ground.

00:44:03 You pull a large lever towards you.

00:44:03 The faint sounds and status lights of the starship's systems slowly fade away, leaving you in a dim silence.

00:44:05 You scramble to your feet.

00:44:05 [Starship "Firestorm"; Airlock]
You can go out and enter into the ship.

00:44:05 You exit the ship.
[Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport]
The three-person clipper "Firestorm" is landed here.

00:44:07 You see a lacquered wooden bar, a public holovid, a small red trash can, a brightly-lit candy vending machine, and a salt lick here.
Sean Sloan, Jada Nelson, and Don Murphy are standing here. Bryan Stout is sitting on a cushy booth seat. Hakeem Oiadip is sitting on a comfortable wooden chair.
You can go out.

00:44:13 Hakeem Oiadip waves to you.

00:44:17 You wave.

00:44:20 Don Murphy nods.

00:44:21 Jada Nelson waves.

00:44:24 Don Murphy says, "Will do."

00:44:28 Bryan Stout says, "Just try and reload those chainguns and we'll be solid."

00:44:35 Your ship 'Firestorm' has been automatically moved into a garage.

00:44:36 Bryan Stout says, "Torps too, I forget if my pincer has them."

00:44:36 Don Murphy says, "Ok no probs."

00:44:38 Bryan Stout holds your hand, taking you into his group.

00:45:07 Hakeem Oiadip says, "Last time I was in you changed back to torps."

00:45:09 You hear chairs scraping as a group of people get up and prepare to leave.

00:45:46 Bryan Stout says, "Okay, torps then."

00:46:40 Don Murphy says, "Well just keep me right."

00:46:42 Don Murphy smiles.

00:47:09 A custodian sighs and begins sweeping together a large pile of broken glass.

00:48:16 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Trying to hurry."

00:49:52 Bryan Stout speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

00:49:52 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "Yep."

00:49:58 Bryan Stout speaks into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator:

00:49:59 [General Communication] Bryan Stout transmits, "It's gonna be a pincer when you get here."

00:50:09 [General Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Alright."

00:50:22 Hakeem Oiadip sighs and waves.

00:50:23 Hakeem Oiadip scrambles to his feet.

00:50:23 Hakeem Oiadip strides out.

00:50:47 The image on the nearest holovid trembles minutely as the image of the two-person Accord gemini "Kasztanka" launches from the outside landing pad and rises into space.

00:51:00 Bryan Stout shrugs helplessly.

00:51:42 Don Murphy orders a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:51:47 Bryan Stout takes a sip of a cup of sweetened hot black Colombian coffee with cream.

00:51:47 Don Murphy takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:51:55 Don Murphy sits down on a comfortable wooden chair.

00:52:10 Don Murphy exclaims, "Caffeine is always good for the headache!"

00:52:11 Sean Sloan sighs.

00:52:18 Don Murphy takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:52:24 Bryan Stout says, "Sorry."

00:52:25 Sean Sloan orders a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:52:34 Don Murphy smiles.

00:52:37 Don Murphy takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:52:40 Sean Sloan says, "No, all the coffee drinking made me have to drink tooo."

00:52:43 Sean Sloan nods.

00:52:45 Sean Sloan takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:52:45 Bryan Stout laughs.

00:52:49 I don't understand that.

00:52:53 Jada Nelson glances down at her watch momentarily.

00:52:53 You chuckle.

00:52:57 Jada Nelson
She appears to be 27 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has caramel skin. Her body is full-figured with pleasantly rounded hips and strong calves. She has rounded shoulders and rather large breasts. Her face is oval and lovely, with a delicate nose and round chin. Her lips are full and brown and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of expressive eyebrows, her eyes are brown and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, very curly hair is dark chocolate brown with gold streaks and hanging in tiny, delicate ringlets. She has oval clear fingernails.
 She is wearing a sleeveless amber cotton dress with a row of tiny matching ribbon rosettes at the neckline and hem and a pair of white flats. She is also wearing a keychain, a message board reader, a portable newsfeed aggregator, a violet backpack, a flight control scanner, a primrose yellow touch einrophone in a brown leather phone holster, a metachannel FTL communicator and watch, a personal filing computer, a bulky asteroid supply cannon, a purple vinyl duffel bag, a compact metallic sapphire blue camera with a gold fleur-de-lys embossed on the front with a glittery blue camera strap, a large expandable telescoping xenology container, and a thick synthleather bandolier with large pockets. Her head, face, both eyes, neck, both biceps, both elbows, both forearms, both wrists, both hands, both thighs, both knees, both calves, and both a
00:52:57 nkles are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

00:53:05 Don Murphy takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:53:09 A group of pilots is holding an intense meeting on the other side of the room.

00:53:25 Sean Sloan takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:53:35 Bryan Stout asks, "Oh my, what happened to our GSL?"

00:53:37 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the vostok-class capsule "The Atocha Star".

00:53:52 Don Murphy asks, "GSL?"

00:53:53 A bit of movement out of the corner of your eye draws your attention to the nearest holovid, where the image of a ship can be seen landing on the outside landing pad. An informative bit of text below it identifies it as the two-person medium transport "Silver Starlight".

00:53:59 Evangeline Adaire just arrived.

00:54:01 Bryan Stout says, "Ground squad leader."

00:54:07 Bryan Stout says, "Similar to space defense captain."

00:54:07 Jada Nelson nods.

00:54:07 Don Murphy finishes off a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:54:10 A loud laugh bursts out from a group at a nearby table.

00:54:13 Don Murphy puts a mug in a small red trash can.

00:54:14 Bryan Stout says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "What happened to GSL?"

00:54:19 You wave at a gold vase containing a bouquet of fire and ice roses and red roses.

00:54:21 Sean Sloan takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:54:24 You wave to Evangeline Adaire.

00:54:28 Jada Nelson says, "Hi hi."

00:54:33 Evangeline Adaire smiles.

00:54:38 Don Murphy says, "Hi."

00:54:39 Don Murphy waves.
Evangeline Adaire hugs you.

00:54:43 Evangeline Adaire says, "Hello."

00:54:48 Sean Sloan takes a sip of a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:54:48 Bryan says to you, "You don't mind flying right?"

00:54:56 Don Murphy says, "Nice to meet you."

00:55:03 Sean Sloan asks, "This is beacons right?"

00:55:06 Bryan Stout says, "Unless you guys don't mind waiting a few minutes while I show don a few things."

00:55:06 Evangeline Adaire says, "I'm Evangeline it is nice to meet you too."

00:55:11 Bryan Stout says, "Yes this is beacons."

00:55:11 You say, "I hadn't palanned on it, but I don't mind."

00:55:15 You say, "Planned."

00:55:22 Bryan Stout gives you a thumbs up!

00:55:23 Bryan Stout holds Evangeline Adaire's hand, taking her into his group.

00:55:25 Bryan Stout says into his ice blue metachannel FTL communicator, "Oh my."

00:55:31 Sean Sloan says, "Thank the space god, if it had be missions I'd be screwed."

00:55:32 Don Murphy stands up from a comfortable wooden chair.

00:55:34 Bryan Stout asks, "We all ready?"

00:55:35 Sean Sloan finishes off a mug of hot rich Colombian coffee.

00:55:36 Evangeline Adaire nods.

00:55:36 Don Murphy stretches.

00:55:38 Don Murphy nods.

00:56:16 Jada Nelson's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Weapon room 2 here."

00:56:31 You ask, "Ok, so I'm flying?"

00:56:33 Bryan Stout's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Excellent."

00:56:39 Evangeline Adaire's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Weapons room one, here."

00:56:53 I don't understand that.

00:56:56 I don't understand that.

00:56:57 [Starship "The Wolves Have Claws"; Airlock]

00:56:57 You see a large PANEL of environmental controls here. Lights overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is at Old Earth; Manhattan Spaceport. The hatch appears to be locked. A small green light near the hatch marks that the airlock currently possesses a safe environment.
You can go out and enter into the ship.

01:51:41 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
01:51:41 e-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white trash bin, a high tech silver star print holovid, Purr the humanoid service robot, and Mischief the large black felo here.
Lily Kaise is sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch.
You can go south and out.
(You are sitting on a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.)

01:52:40 You peer south...

01:52:41 
[Starship "William Dove"; Base Block]
The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a soft round ocean blue rug with a design of coral and turquoise seashells, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a round white rattan dining table with a glass top, a blueberry rattan bench with a long white and coral pink flowered cushion on it, a rattan floor lamp with a coral lotus shade, a blueberry rattan pantry cabinet, a small dusky pink trash bin, and a glossy azure blue ceramic felo chow bowl here.
You can go north, east, south, west, up, and down.

01:53:10 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws snaps its claws menacingly at a plastic frond of light green sea fern.

01:53:22 You say, "And many girls wouldn't be ok with their boyfriend wearing their panties."

01:53:26 You laugh.

01:54:48 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah it is a little odd but hey if you like wearing an item of your significant other's clothing, that's cool."

01:55:23 You grin.

01:55:31 Lily Kaise grins.

01:56:09 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

01:56:19 You say, "Then again, there are those who won't share a glass, cup or straw with their significant other."

01:57:21 [Notification from Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] The organization has gained 4,351,851.85 credits for a submission from a battle analysis scanner on AEU Battle-Scanning Nuclear Temporary Station involving the five-person hammerhead "Wherever Wolves May Roam".

02:00:15 Purr the humanoid service robot spasmodically shakes a container of fish food over a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks.

02:00:16 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "The results are in!"

02:00:17 A metallic silver metachannel FTL communicator beeps insistently as it receives a new notice.

02:00:17 0.00 credits of your income have gone toward your organization.

02:00:18 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps south.

02:00:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "We did not achieve any of our performance goals."

02:00:21 [AEU | 10: Conquest Status] An AEU pilot corps liaison transmits, "Our performance was down 61.3% from the last Conquest period."

02:00:54 Purr the humanoid service robot clomps into the room.

02:03:09 A large semi-transparent ovoid creature with medium-length dangling tendrils and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly past a small plastic statue of a Jinu.

02:04:09 Mischief the large black felo hums melodically to itself as it wanders out.

02:08:22 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.

02:14:09 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo jumps into your lap and settles in, purring.

02:14:16 You stroke the soft fur of Prissy the big violet long-haired felo.

02:14:17 Prissy the big violet long-haired felo purrs and rubs its head against your hand, looking up at you adoringly.

02:20:09 Mischief the large black felo rubs up against Lily Kaise's leg with a quiet "Mrrp."

02:20:22 Lily Kaise kisses you.

02:20:34 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:20:34 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "Hey and good day all."

02:20:38 You kiss Lily Kaise on the lips.

02:20:42 I don't understand that.

02:20:43 Lily Kaise kisses you on the lips.

02:20:46 You cuddle up to Lily Kaise.

02:21:00 Lily Kaise squeezes you affectionately.

02:21:03 Lily Kaise cuddles up to you.

02:21:11 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Hi Lily."

02:22:40 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Vernos Bailey transmits, "I got the accel and inserter back up at 285 but the only station left was the asteroid processor and I am not sure how much time is left on it."

02:23:10 A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws grips a white plastic undersea castle firmly in its claws, then gives up when it can't break the toy.

02:23:47 Lily Kaise says, "We do the Asteroid processor. I'll go check."

02:23:52 Lily Kaise says, "Oops."

02:23:54 You nod.

02:23:58 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:23:58 [AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Lily Kaise transmits, "We do the Asteroid processor. I'll go check."

02:24:02 Lily Kaise stands up from a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it.

02:24:04 Lily Kaise glides out.

02:24:05 The airlock hatch chimes quietly.

02:35:34 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Huh, okay. Can you guys make those?"

02:35:36 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:35:36 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I don't use them anymore though as although they squish the debris down so that it's smaller, it becomes less valuable. They are handy though for combat ships so that a pilot can salvage more debris."

02:35:56 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:35:56 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Yep."

02:35:57 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Yes, both of us can craft those."

02:36:10 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Does compressing the debris affect its point value, or just the cash value?"

02:36:30 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:36:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Mostly it's grade I think so would probably affect both."

02:36:49 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "I thought I had discovered the easy path to 3000 industry."

02:37:11 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:37:11 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "However some like them because you get more bang for your credit so to speak so just depends on what you're after."

02:37:55 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Can you turn them on and off, or is your storage space forever getting compressed once you install it?"

02:38:13 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:38:14 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "Obviously if you're going to be able to fit more in there, but I am not convinced you earn more. Also don't use them if you do salvaging mission for Accord."

02:38:18 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "You have to manual use it."

02:38:27 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Oh, I see."

02:38:30 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "Manually."

02:38:37 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "From the control room."

02:39:16 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone transmits, "Well, I may ask one of you to make me one after I do a mining site or two."

02:41:35 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire transmits, "No problem."

02:42:43 Lily Kaise speaks into her neon purple metachannel FTL communicator:

02:42:44 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Lily Kaise transmits, "I think we can give you the special discount hehe."

02:43:25 [Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Constantine Stone laughs.

02:44:03 Lily Kaise says, "If you want to earn something, then you can make it for him as I'd just make it for him and not charge him. Just ask that if he went out to GMG and got the supplies that he would provide them."

02:44:09 Lily Kaise grins.

02:44:28 You say, "Nah, go for it."

02:44:48 You say, "It's an org member. I don't charge org members."

02:44:53 Lily Kaise removes Lily Kaise's workbench from a lavender silk backpack embroidered with brightly hued butterflies.

02:44:56 Lily Kaise puts down Lily Kaise's workbench.

03:10:05 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:10:05 A voice comes over the speaker and says, "Striking Distance, you have clearance to launch. Good luck and come back to us safely."
You feel mild acceleration as the ship lifts off smoothly.

03:10:05 Lily Kaise glides up.

03:10:07 I don't see that here.

03:10:15 The ship is already moving.

03:10:15 The mild vibration of acceleration eases off and is replaced by the firm pull of artificial gravity as the ship pulls into clear space.

03:10:16 Which sector did you mean?

03:10:17 
[1] Hamilton's Funnel (Unclaimed)
[2] The Drift Funnel (Fringe)

Enter your selection:

03:10:18 The computer says, "Destination selected. Four jumps to Hamilton's Funnel. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:10:19 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:10:19 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Deep Wastes."

03:10:20 The computer announces, "Automatic post-launch wormhole jump aborted."

03:10:21 You press a button to cancel the current autopilot program.

03:10:23 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:10:24 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:10:26 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:10:26 The sensors tell you that this area is full of valuable salvage, but all you can see of it yourself is dark smudges that block the light of the stars.
The computer says, "Jump sequence aborted."

03:10:28 The computer says, "Destination selected. Five jumps to The Drift Funnel. Initializing quantum wormhole selection sequence."

03:10:28 You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:10:29 Via general sector communication, Beacon A-21 transmits in a robotic voice, "Detecting vessel 'Striking Distance.' Welcome to The Deep Wastes."

03:10:29 The computer says, "Convergent wormhole located. Expanding wormhole and jumping to The Borderlands."

03:10:32 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:10:34 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:10:36 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:10:36 Once the frontier of Known Space for many years, the Borderlands region is now a settled area of space, though rather poor compared to most others. A handful of beacons indicate the positions of clouds of debris, but a nearby star indicates a solar system may also be in this cluster.
The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Four jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:10:37 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Tuxtla Territories."

03:10:38 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:10:38 You stumble, then fall heavily to the floor.
(3 seconds roundtime.)

03:10:40 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:10:41 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:10:41 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Three jumps remaining."
You hear a sharp electronic whine as power suddenly flows into the wormhole drive.

03:10:42 Lily Kaise's voice comes over the loudspeaker and says, "Huh hope I still remember how to gun."

03:10:42 The computer says, "Rapid linking to next waypoint enabled. Expanding wormhole and jumping to Candelaria Orbit."

03:10:43 The starship shudders violently as it nears the wormhole mouth.

03:10:45 The windows automatically dim as space outside dissolves into a bright flash of light.

03:10:46 The bright light fades and is once again replaced by the black vacuum and stars of a different sector of space.  The vibrations slowly ease off as the wormhole shrinks and disappears.

03:10:46 The computer says, "Continuing jump sequence. Two jumps remaining."

03:32:39 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

03:49:26 Lily Kaise smiles at you.

03:49:30 Lily Kaise
She appears to be 28 years old. She is about five feet and two inches tall and has fair skin. Her body is thin with attractively curved hips and shapely calves. She has slender shoulders and slightly larger than average breasts. Her face is oval and pretty, with a delicate nose and understated chin. Her lips are lovely and blush pink and occasionally part to reveal a set of pretty teeth. Beneath a set of arched eyebrows, her eyes are blue-green and almond-shaped. Her mid-back length, straight hair is pale honey blonde and swept up into a thick fall of loose curls down her back. She has oval pink fingernails.
A small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her left earlobe and a small enameled cerulean blue dragonfly pierces her right earlobe.
 She is wearing a mystic purple synthcotton shipsuit and a pair of mystic purple suede clogs. She is also wearing an orange and white blessed prayer bracelet around her wrist, a slender bracelet of tiny tinkling silver bells around her wrist, a neon purple wrist-mounted chronometer, a solid silver ring engraved with dragonflies, a delicate ring of silver wire and small purple amethyst crystals, a light purple flightbag with a pastel kitten on the side, a metallic gold touch einrophone in a metallic purple reinforced plastic phone holster, an elegant white gold ring inset with a perfect solitaire diamond, and a soft fuchsia Tardick lizard snuggly labeled 'Asteria'. Her head, face, bot
03:49:30 h eyes, both wrists, and both hands are left uncovered.
She is carrying nothing.

03:53:27 You kiss Lily Kaise.

03:57:10 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl

03:58:39 You chuckle.

03:59:41 Lily Kaise says, "Yeah dunno. Maybe when I wake up later today, I'll look around a bit more."

04:00:17 You nod.

04:01:06 You say, "I'll keep an eye out too."

04:07:13 A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many tendrils.

09:03:00 [General Communication] Keegan Wantz transmits, "Maybe it was blind -and- couldn't smell?"

10:00:57 This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

10:03:01 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

10:05:05 The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked 'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the spaceport.

23:57:40 [Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purpl
