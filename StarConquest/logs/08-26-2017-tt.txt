-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small purple trash bin, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a
glass top, a pocket-sized purple holovid, a pair of gray canvas sneakers, and
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo here.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident is dozing on a white four poster rattan bed.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is at Space Market.

of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.

and an amethyst glowing interior drifts slowly over a white plastic undersea
castle.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident flips a high tech silver star print holovid to
WMOS.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The view pans slowly through a lush
forest.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An aged stump gradually comes into
view as the camera pans.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Once the stump is centered in view,
the camera zooms in slowly.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: You see a sizable green growth on
the stump. The camera continues zooming in.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: It becomes clear that the green
growth on the stump is indeed moss.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in to show the fine
details of the mossy growth and soft rotting wood.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident laughs.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: After a long, lingering gaze at the
moss, the camera zooms out and resumes panning around the forest.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A deep voice intones gravely, "You
are watching... The Moss Channel."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An excited man suddenly speaks up.
"Have you ever wanted the power of a computer in your very own home?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "You've been told it's impossible,
but not anymore! Introducing the PERSONAL COMPUTER!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image appears of a woman standing
next to a computer about twelve feet wide.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "International Computing Machines is
proud to present a computer that fits into about HALF a room!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Visit a local branch of
International Computing Machines and speak to a salesman today!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The view pans slowly through a lush
forest.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A patch of green on the ground
gradually comes into view as the camera pans.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Once the green patch is centered in
view, the camera zooms in slowly.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Some scattered fallen leaves lie
upon the green patch. The camera continues zooming in.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: It becomes clear that the green
patch on the ground is indeed moss.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The camera zooms in to show the fine
details of the carpet of moss.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: After a long, lingering gaze at the
moss, the camera zooms out and resumes panning around the forest.

From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image appears of a cartoon pilot
in a classic gray shipsuit just rising from bed.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The pilot stretches, smacks his
lips, and opens his mouth to yawn. Then he pauses, and suddenly looks ecstatic
as a lit light bulb appears over his head.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The pilot deliberately lifts his
wrist communicator to his mouth, pushes its send button, and yawns widely.
Yellow morning breath washes over the device as various voices emerge from it,
crying out in dismay.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An upbeat jingle begins, sung by a
number of women: "When you're rising from your bed! Keep just one thing in your
head:"
[General Communication] Melinda Michaels transmits, "Hi."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "Hey trouble."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Howdy Mel."
[General Communication] Ali Candan transmits, "Hello."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "No one wants to hear that yawn! Get
your finger off that comm!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A male voice adds in spoken word, "A
message from the Association For Clean Airwaves."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The view pans slowly through a lush

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident flips a high tech silver star print holovid to
ISNN.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays to the image of
a galaxy of stars swirling around rapidly. "Around the galaxy and into your
home... it's the Space News Break on ISNN! Dateline: 14 August 2317."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The scene cuts abruptly to show a
well-groomed newscaster seated at a desk. He nods to the camera and arranges his
papers before him.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Our top story tonight: The AEU
Outccord Negotiations."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: An image appears of the Accord logo
with a big red X superimposed over it.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident sighs.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "During the AEU election campaign,
President Best spoke of having the AEU leave the Accord of Free Worlds, but most
people dismissed his talk as hyperbole to win votes. Of course, in the beginning
of July this year the President proved his detractors wrong and began the
proceedings to allow the AEU to formally withdraw from the Accord."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Yeah we unfortunately did."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The newcaster turns to face another
camera. "Each alliance within the Accord of Free Worlds enters into an agreement
that they must abide by. This agreement is a monolithic document, but sets down
regulations the member alliances must follow."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image is replaced by a series of
bullet points.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: * Monetary remuneration to assist
Accord defense of interalliance space
From a high tech silver star print holovid: * Supply and resource shipments to
the Accord for Accord use, stockpiling, and transfer to other alliances
From a high tech silver star print holovid: * Personnel, both military and
civilian, sent to the Accord when needed
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The list vanishes to once again show
the newscaster. "Of course, the agreement also sets down how a member alliance
may leave. On 21st July, the Alliance of ExtraSolar Unions formally initiated
the withdrawal process and sent Edward van Dannikin, leader of the controversial
People's ExtraSolar Union party, to be their chief negotiator."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "We managed to get a quote from
Mister van Dannikin during a brief recess in the negotiations."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of a middle-aged man with
greying hair appears.  He smirks at the camera.  "Well, of course leaving the
Accord is the best choice for the Union. All it's ever done is restrict what we
can do. Once we're out we'll be a sovereign alliance again, free to make our own
choices. Who wouldn't want that? Only people who don't want what's best for the
Union."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Oh that's the jerk."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades, revealing the
newscaster once again.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Of course, not everyone is quite so
positive.  Leader of the Opposition Ginevra Culwyn gave her thoughts to us a few
hours ago."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image of a woman in her fifties
appears. She frowns and looks at someone off-camera.  "This entire process has
been chaotic, and there has been little in the way of debate or discussion. The
President may claim he has a mandate, but even though his party won the election
it doesn't give them the freedom to ignore disagreement."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "I agree with her on that one!"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: She shifts in her seat, looking a
little uncomfortable. "This needed to be a careful, considered event. The only
people who have had their say here are supporters of the President, basically
yes-men.  Where is the referendum to see what the rest of the population want? 
What about the people who voted for the National Patriots but don't want to
leave the Accord?"
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Culwyn shakes her head.  "There is
still no public plan, no discussion about what happens once we leave. Is it all
in President Best's head, or is there really no plan set down?  This is an
unparalleled act of self-harm, and the National Patriots are sleepwalking us
into it."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades, returning to the
newscaster.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "Of course, there have been some
significant events surrounding Outccord, such as the broadcasts from the now
familiar Eli Grey."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: A picture appears behind the
newscaster of an oddly blue-skinned man sitting in what is noted as the pilot
lounge located on Old Earth.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "As well as the strike by the
Union's civilian pilots initiated by the intentional destruction of several
transport ships."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Footage of three transports
exploding in New Earth orbit is shown, a fourth transport floating nearby.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: "By all accounts the withdrawal
process is almost complete, though Accord experts suggest the AEU won't fully
withdraw until the first week of September. After that... we shall have to see.
Until then, this has been the Space News Break, only on ISNN."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The ISNN theme plays as the camera
slowly pans out from the newscaster.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The image fades to black for a
moment.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The holoimage shows a bright flame
shoot straight upwards, gradually changing shape into a bird.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: Spinning, the fire bird creates the
words AEU TODAY out of its own flame.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The fire bird flies away, leaving
the words superimposed over the newly revealed image of New Earth.  Blocky text
appears underneath: JANUARY 6TH 2317
From a high tech silver star print holovid: New Earth's image is replaced with a
view of two men, one sitting at a desk while the other relaxes on a couch.
From a high tech silver star print holovid: The tall, middle aged man at the
desk nods towards the camera amiably.  "Good evening, I am Angus Ireman."
From a high tech silver star print holovid: He continues with a smile. "On this
special edition of AEU Today we will be speaking publicly for the first time to
a well known local boy - Ace Pilot of the Union's civilian corps Ather Jammoa -
about the state of the Union, the status of the corps, and perhaps a few other
things."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Evangeline Adaire transmits, "Wow, there is
never a day I can remember when not getting anything from my trustfund."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident turns a high tech silver star print holovid off.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident asks, "I suppose taht is more important than why?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "Getting your trust fund money Evangeline is
more important than what we're standing up for."

hate."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Only 3 reapers in here now."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I hate that for an entirely
different reason."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Just don't salvage with the
rats. Find another sector and you're fine. I only fight rats fighters when I'm
salvagin. Them rats'll whoop up on me. So I just go to a different sector."
[General Communication] Sausage Lover Jada Nelson transmits, "Aww."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "The reapers will I mean."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I go to a different sector by
default."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't notice they're any
more a problem there in Orion than elsewhere like the various beacons in the
Tesla pipe they send me to."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I know, I just don't like
being able to see how much is in there from the outside for some reason, I
prefer it when I jump in there rather than auto-vec in, I don't know why."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Don't seem no different from
some of the other beacons. I've found Rats in the sector them places too. I like
Orion 'cause I'm so close to the station."
A large thickly-shelled creature with a yellow shell and four small claws beats
its claws together.
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders out.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "So, how are we doing
today?"
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Tara Flores transmits, "Watching the holovid
right now."
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Doing alright
I suppose."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.
[AEU | 1: Alliance Communication] Aldis Whylita transmits, "And it's going
reasonably well for me, all thing considered. It seems the Moss Channel is the
only thing good on right now. After all, there's only so many times you can
watch the reruns of the 2310 Competitive Tea Drinking finals."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an
insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, Purr the humanoid service
robot, Prissy the sleeping big violet long-haired felo, and Shine the big white
glowing felo here.
You can go south and out.

Things are looking ok so far, just lots of rain. this is supposed to continue
for several days though and I'm not one for putting much trust into forces of
nature doing what you think they will
I hope everyone else who might be in the path of the storm here is doing alright

Having always lived in Australia, imagining these horrible storms is difficult.
May you and yours stay safe, and anyone else in the path of this.

A firmly rooted animal with dozens of smooth yellow tendrils slowly waves its

caress lily on back
You gently caress Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident's back.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "But people think badly of
cannibalism, yet it's OK for beef fed corn stock but not beef fed beef stock if
that's true."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "As would a corn-fed cornstalk.
Both cannibals."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "'cause it ain't eatin its own
kind."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Seriously though, I would
imagine if you killed a cow and buried it in a corn field, it would make great
fertilizer."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah chortles. "You guys have clearly had a
while to consider this carefully."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Not long."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "But why should eating beef be
wrong for beef but not corn?"
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Why should eating humans be
wrong for humans, but felo takin a chomp outta us is all fine."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I never said that was fine."
kiss lily on neck
You kiss Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident softly on the neck.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I'm makin an analogy..."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's just interesting, how we
decide what's right or wrong."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "And we also laugh half the
time when we walk aboard a ship and they attack us by jumping at our heads."
Lily gently rubs your back.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "We do. But we ain't happy when
they attack each other."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Only because we know we'll be
healed in a few minutes."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "Nah, that's true too."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "They only bite us
because they like the way we taste, so it's kinda our fault."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "But if they bite each other
'cause they like the way they taste, is that right or wrong?"
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "If they bite each
other, it could just mean they're getting ready for some light boning."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "As long as them biting each
other is a sign that they will be good bari fighters."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Umm."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I suppose that depends on
perspective. To us it's wrong because we don't like seein' 'em hurt each other.
But for all we know. It's like. Part of the felo hierarchy."
A firmly rooted animal with dozens of rough green tendrils slowly waves its many
tendrils.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Yep."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "Now, there's a thought."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, she put a better
way. I just meant that animals bite each other all the time for different
reasons."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Still, I don't like to see 'em
hurt each other but don't mind if they hurt me."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "I don't mind eatin beef, but
somehow cattle eatin each other seems wrong."
Prissy the big violet long-haired felo wanders in from the airlock.
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It's interesting how that kind
of feeling comes about though."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Yeah, it does just have
a certain inherent wrogness to it."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And corn eatin beef...is just
weird 'cause in general, with a few exceptions, plants ain't sposed to do nothin
but sit there and absorb sunlight and nutrients."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er,  wrongness."

You beam at Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "And corn is a plant that does
that sittin round absorbin really well...so the tought of it eatin beef...is
just...the stuff of nightmares."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Thought I mean."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "No it's not. Can you imagine
steak flavored corn on the cob? That owuld be amazing. Especially wrapped in
bacon."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "It would be a whole lot
scarier if it started eating humans."
[General Communication] Evenia Callseah transmits, "I sometimes wonder something
else too. If felo have come from the same nest, perhaps the first from that nest
sorta have a protective nature. So maybe, they hurt a kitten if like...maybe
they can sense it's sick, or something. So perhaps in a strange way, it's the
felo protecting the herd."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "That's a good thought,
Johann."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "New Earth that can eat
people."
[General Communication] Johann Schraft transmits, "Now what they really need is
bacon fed corn."
[General Communication] Morris Corlew transmits, "Ain't much of a stretch to go
from corn eatin a big ol cow to corn eatin a lil human."
[General Communication] Rogue Pilot Eli Grey transmits, "Er a plant from new
earth that can eat people."

about that."

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident suddenly awakens.
[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an
insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid
service robot here.

thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this

starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. Lights
overhead indicate that the ship is on green status. Looking through the windows,
you see that the ship is in space.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.

to do a mission and a half because of people doing that with missions the other
day."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "How do you mean a mission and a
half?"
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "They must have had a wreck in
the same place as one somebody else had, so when they thought they were full,
they went back to Orion, and it didn't all count as their mission, so they had
to go back out again."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I've not heard of that happening
before, but oh well."
[General Communication] Ted Warburton transmits, "I've had something similar,
two of us with missions in the same place at the same time, and one of the
wrecks I did didn't count."
[General Communication] Emily Ford transmits, "I keep trying to fill up with a
round hundred pieces, just because. So I end up expelling the larger pieces and
taking twice as long to fill up."

not sure the extra rewards would be worth the extra time to me."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.

leather and has a polished steel frame. The high back, seat, and armrests are
firmly but deeply padded to mitigate the vibrations, shaking, and sudden changes
of velocity of both normal starship operations and combat. The chair swivels
smoothly from side to side to provide an extended reach of control room
instrument panels.
On top of it you see a long-sleeved dark pink tee appliqued with small neon pink
dragonflies and a dark pink lace bullet bra.

Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "When you are curious or have time, just
come look over the terminal and I know we'd appreciate your help with building

[General Communication] A space bus driver transmits, "Space Bus 213 to Nouveau
Quebec now boarding at Space Station "Foxtrot"! Departure in one Earth hour!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "We only have one plant at the moment. Since
we are a newer organizaiton, we weren't one of the original orgs who were able
to get first cuttings."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "They are pretty expensive to obtain so in
time we'll get a few more."
Tara Flores nods.
Tara Flores asks, "I'm guessing they take time to grow?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "The one we do have is the Double-Laser
plant and it is great."
Tara Flores asks, "What does that do?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It adds to the percentage of damage that
lasers can effect."
Lily says to you, "Maybe has a better explanation."
Tara Flores says, "Oh, so an offensive upgrade."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident grins.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "You do lose some of the damage output from
Minicannons but we don't typically encourage anything but the use of lasers on
AEU Combat ships."
Tara Flores asks, "Yeah, since the systems on the ships highly amplify the
effect of lasers, right?"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "It's a very small percentage that you lose
so it's a very worthwhile plant on a Gunship or a pulsar and on a Cruiser."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident nods to Tara Flores.

guessing."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "If we use some other Alliance ship, they
aren't really going to effect more than they would for another alliance."
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "But they really are awesome for us!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.
Tara Flores nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Lily says to Tara, "For Organizaiton members, plant cuttings are free per the
number of ships you have that are applicable."
Tara Flores says, "I still mainly use my Cadet fighter for combat."
Tara Flores nods to Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident exclaims, "Yeah that's a ship you will probably
have forever!"
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident smiles.
Lily Kaise, Phoenix Dissident says, "A lot of us prefer them."

zip around with automated efficiency. A row of couches face toward the windows,
leaving a relatively open section in the middle of the room. The news broadcast

Mutuality. Ugh the thing that disgusts me the most about Best's campaigning is
how he's trying to kick so many people out of our space."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.

[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "Just remember who the
person that wants to privitaze the corporation is, and who the people of the
pilot corps are acting agaisnt. My biggest fear is this will allow best himself
more control over who can and can't be a pilot. Privtization in a nutshell means
pulling a organziation out of the public sector into the private sector. Which
means we'd also lose what little influence we have with the government entirely.
At least, that's probably what Best wants to do. I hope im wrong."
tr or That's why we didn't vote for the president who wanted privatization
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Shule Elemmire, Phoenix Dissident transmits,
"That's why we didn't vote for the president who wanted privatization."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "I'm not
really sure about any of that. Best isn't the only one who has called for
privatization -- another presidential candidate also did, and I think right now,
most everyone would be happy to have him instead."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "Really
it all depends on who controls the corps once it's privatized. It could be
terrible, or it could be basically the same, or even better."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "We
really have no way of knowing."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Certainly Best wouldn't have control over who is and isn't a pilot unless he
were the owner of the corps, though."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits,
"Currently he does have control over that."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "And
presidents have closed the corps off in the past."
[Tactical Communication] Alko Delovega transmits, "Beacons?"
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Tara Flores transmits, "The biggest question,
would you rather work for the AEU itself and aid it as a whole, or work for a
private corporation who probably doesn't give a damn about the well being of the
masses."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "The
corporation would still work for the AEU."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "All I'm
saying is we basically have no details about this."
[Space Explorers Amidst The Stars] Patriot Constantine Stone transmits, "What if
the corporation were pilot owned and run? There are a lot of possibilities."

Destroyers:
Three-Person Light Escort 15,000,000.00 (New Earth Blazing Trails)
AS-0A AEU LIGHT ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 50 industry points        15 combat points
Model number: AS-0A                     Designation: Light Escort
Turret hardpoints: 10                   Launcher hardpoints: 1
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 10
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The light Escort is the first destroyer that an AEU pilot will ever have access
to. It's a reasonably well armed vessel, with no major bonuses. However, it can
still pack quite a punch, especially with more advanced upgrades and its single
launcher.
Three-Person Heavy Defense Vessel 7,500,000.00 (Endymion)
AD-1N AEU HEAVY DEFENSE VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 100 industry points       250 combat points
Model number: AD-1N                     Designation: Heavy Defense Vessel
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 4
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The defense vessel is a very well armed vessel, holding 12 turrets. It does have
a major disadvantage though, which likely also explains the cheaper cost. That
disadvantage is that it has no FTL drive. However, it can still be a very useful
ship, but just know if you want to take it anywhere you'll need to dock it
inside a bigger ship, or tug it around using a tugboat.
Three-Person Clipper 200,000,000.00 (New Earth Allied Technologies)
AS-4F AEU CLIPPER-CLASS ESCORT VESSEL
Class: Destroyer
Requirements: 750 industry points       750 combat points
Model number: AS-4F                     Designation: Clipper
Turret hardpoints: 12                   Launcher hardpoints: 0
Standard storage capacity: 20000        Standard battery hours: 14
Docking bay size required: 40
Class Modifications:
Damage vs. Small Ships: 105%            Hull Hit Chance by Small Ships: 95%
Max Cruising Speed: 102%
The Clipper is the most advanced destroyer that the AEU has. It's as armed as
the defense vessel with 12 turrets, but has the further advantage of a vastly
increased engine speed when it's going at maximum burn, and also has an extra
hull failsafe over the other two destroyers.

A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically

You see a corvette here.
"Deadly Strike" is written along its hull in flaming metallic yellow letters.
The designation "AW-2" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is gleaming and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its laser
turrets are sleek and dangerous-looking and outlined in silver. Its landing
struts are flawless and strong and painted gunmetal grey.
It has an AEU logo forward on the port side and a smooth dome and a geodesic
radome on the forward end.

[Starship "Albatross"; Engineering Room]
The engineering room is much cleaner and sterile than most people expect when
they first board a starship. Though there are some exposed, thick bundles of
wires running here and there, most of the actual workings of the ship are deeper
in its structure. Instead, the room is virtually bare and brightly lit, with one
wall dominated by a large graphical representation of the ship and its
components, alongside current estimates of damage levels. On the right is a
small starmap set into a wall, displaying a bare minimum of information so that
it is not a distraction to the one keeping the ship together. A simple control
board allows the operator to prioritize repairs. The status lights overhead are
currently not receiving power. Looking through the windows, you see that the
ship is in a garage.

l mosaic
a mosaic star box
This square box measures about twenty centimeters in all dimensions. It is made
of silver metal covered with a mosaic depicting a large stylized white star on
the top with a pale blue center and a deep midnight blue background spotted with
smaller red, blue, orange, and yellow stars. The white star's tendrils stream
outward in smooth arcs down the sides of the box, curving around additional
smaller stars. The mosaic's tiny pieces of broken plastic and the thin lines of
silver-colored cement holding them in place are covered with a thin high-gloss
glaze that is smooth to the touch.
It is closed.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, a dark green leather
captain's chair, and a small red insulated cooler here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[1] Lordy, The Phoenix Flies
Enter your selection:
1
You see a scout here.
"Lordy, The Phoenix Flies" is written along its hull in blocky silver letters.
The designation "AY-104" is stamped in tiny letters near its landing struts.
This starship advertises its function with its form. It does not look
particularly flightworthy, with protruding turrets, communications equipment,
and a box-like protrusion in the rear where the reactionless drive and wormhole
drive reside. But, of course, it is not intended to fly through an atmosphere. A
small protrusion on the nose of the vessel is its main sensor relay. Only the
bottom appears smooth, and even that is marred by the extension of its landing
struts when not in flight.
The hull is somewhat dull and painted a deep green color with silver trim. Its
laser turrets are blackened and outlined in silver. Its landing struts are clean
and painted gunmetal grey.
It has a smooth dome and a geodesic radome on the forward end.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at The Torus; Dock Alpha.

You glance at your communicator's screen.
Notice from the Voice of the Corps: Pilots, an update on the availability of
services and upgrades in Mutuality space -- apparently a level of technology
exchange was part of the QSA agreement. The Mutuality has lost access to
upgrades they were able to buy from us (they made sure to tell me the ugprades
were useless to them anyway, so we likely won't be using them to strike a new
bargain), and in turn, we can't buy any from them. This is pretty disappointing
to me, and I'm sure to many others, as it means we won't be outfitting new
expedition ships any time soon. Hopefully when this Outccord business ends we
can turn our attention towards repairing our relationship with the Mutuality.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

brown sleeping mat with a sleeping hefty red soldier felo kitten on it]
This strange, six-legged creature is vaguely wolf-like, though its head appears
almost vulpine. It is large in size and covered in short, striped red fur,
possessing a short, sleek tail that slowly flicks back and forth. The felo's
short, thick legs each end in three-toed paws with thick, curved white claws,
visible only when not retracted. A black, horizontal nose sits below a pair of
clear blue eyes with vertical pupils. It appears to be sleeping.

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They
don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses
than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require
ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you
cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit
as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be
stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

seems I need a translator."

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

         Variables differ from the %0-99 arguments in the fact that you can
         specify a full word as a variable, and they stay in memory for the
         full session unless they are changed.  They can be saved in the
         coms file, and can be set to different values if you have two or
         more sessions running at the same time.  Variables are global for
         each session and can be accessed by adding a $ before the variable
         name.

[1;37mExample[0;37m: #alias {target} {#var target %0}
         #alias {x}      {flame $target}

         The name of a variable must exist of only letters and numbers in
         order to be substituted.  If you do not meet these requirements do
         not panic, simply encapsulate the variable in braces:

[1;37mExample[0;37m: #variable {cool website} {http://tintin.sourceforge.net}
         #chat I was on ${cool website} yesterday!.

         Variables can be nested using brackets:

[1;37mExample[0;37m: #var hp[self] 34;#var hp[target] 46

         You can see the first nest of a variable using $variable[+1] and the
         last nest using $variable[-1]. Using $variable[-2] will report the
         second last variable, and so on. To show all indices use $variable[].
         To show all values use $variable[%*] or a less generic regex.

[1;37mComment[0;37m: To see the internal index of a variable use &<variable name>

[1;37mComment[0;37m: A non existent nested variable will report itself as 0.

[1;37mComment[0;37m: You can remove a variable with the #unvariable command.

Author: AEU Pilot Liaison Office
Posted: 07:29 28 August 2317 GST

Edward van Dannikin's escape plan proves that the Accord withdrawal negotiations
are being carried out in bad faith. If the president's chief negotiator believes
that the withdrawal will damage the Union, how can any citizen be expected to
support it? Whether Best was ignorant of or complicit in van Dannikin's
treachery, his own fitness to lead and his motives in the withdrawal are called
into serious question. The civilian pilot corps demands an immediate end to the
withdrawal attempts.

Star Conquest Help: Aces and Veterans
--
Category: Background
--
In Star Conquest, we have a few levels of pilots beyond your standard pilot.
* Ace pilots are well known by most, if not all pilots in the leagues, and their
actions have been recorded in the annals of history, such that anyone with a
vested interest in the pilot leagues would know of their deeds.
* Veteran pilots transcend the ace classification, in that they tend to be
'larger than life'. A veteran pilot tends to be well known in popular (non-pilot
and otherwise) culture, and more often than not have holovids detailing their
exploits.
Obtaining ace or veteran status is handled primarily ingame, through one's
character's actions, although in some cases it can also be obtained through a
special application in character generation.

[Starship "Fighter Sigma Omega Theta"; Control Room]
The core of every starship is the control room. A dais lies at the center of the
room, raised several feet into the air with a smooth curve leading down to the
floorplates and a slight indent at the mostly flattened top.  Dozens of monitors
surround it, split into two separate sections on either side of the dais. There
do not appear to be any keyboards or buttons visible, instead a collection of
pads rest on either side of the dais.  The entire ceiling appears to be a single
light, leaving the room slightly uncomfortably bright.  In a ring around the
outer edge of the floor is a mesh-like grating, from beneath which can be heard
a slow hiss.  The walls are covered in brightly colored murals of an alien
landscape, with several Children of the Sun standing together in similar poses,
as if in the middle of fluid motions. Fierce light shines down from the ceiling,
and the air hangs heavy with moisture. Looking through the windows, you see that
the ship is in space.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the

The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The

Chainguns are components one does not often expect to find on an AEU ship. They
don't hurt the combat grid too badly, and some of them have higher hull bonuses
than any other weapons, but they do have their downsides. Chainguns require
ammunition, and time to reload when the turrets run dry. This will mean you
cannot fire for a certain period of time. Also, without bonuses they do not hit
as hard as the other weapons available to us which means you will likely be
stuck in a battle for a longer time than you might want.

Lasers are most often an AEU pilot's favorite weapon. This is mostly due to the
fact that most AEU ships get nice bonuses for our laser turrets, which makes
using them more worthwhile than using something like chainguns. In some
instances, the lasers also get a really good hull bonus which make them more
useful than heavy launchers if you have a strong enough laser upgrade. The
downside to using lasers however, is that they really drain the combat grid. So
you'll want to find a laser turret that has a good balance between damage, hull
bonus and combat energy grid. There is also a time issue, too. Some of the
heavier lasers pack a nice punch, but have a five second firing time. This could
theoretically hamper your ability to destroy ships in a timely manner. Note: the
potential damage points information in the above stats do not reflect the
additional bonus damage points available in some AEU ships.
