Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "William Dove"; Living Quarters One]
This is a small room designed to give crew members a place to sleep while on
long journeys, and it isn't large enough to do much else. A long counter is
bolted to the wall opposite the entryway, and two narrow bunks have been bolted
to the two remaining walls. A small keypad is next to the door, controlling a
simple lock. The status lights overhead are currently not receiving power.
Looking through the windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a dusky pink rattan cabinet, a small red ball containing a realistic
Bari horde noisemaker, a glossy pale purple ceramic felo chow bowl, a large oval
dark purple and light purple cloth rug, a white four poster rattan bed with a
heart-shaped headboard and filmy deep purple hangings with a soft periwinkle
cashmere blanket, a set of lavender silk sheets, a large periwinkle bed pillow,
a hand-made purple and amethyst flower quilt, and a large periwinkle bed pillow
on it, a small oval turquoise rattan table with a glass top, and a small purple
trash bin here.

[Starship "Effervescent Zephyr"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green
leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Humanity has just emerged from the lowest point in its collective history, and
the closest it has been to extinction since the advent of agriculture. By the
year 2304, the Coalition of humans and their alien allies the Jinu has spread
across the stars, and thought themselves powerful. But the Outsiders, an alien
empire occupying vast reaches of Rimward space, proved them wrong. First contact
between the two allies was severed, and suddenly humanity was alone. Then the
Outsiders attacked in force, and human planets and governments fell one by one.
                         It was the apocalypse.
But contrary to the beliefs of many, not all hope was lost. After five years,
a single starship, the Percival Lowell, returned from Rimward space, bringing
with it the means to nullify the Outsiders' greatest weapon. With this, and the
help of many other brave pilots, the occupying Outsiders were driven off human
               worlds and back to where they came from.
 Humanity is now trying to rebuild, and trying to regain what it has lost. The
Outsiders are finished with occupation, and now desire only to see humans
extinct.
New threats and new mysteries seem to appear every day. In the midst of it all,
civilian starships span the stars, maintaining an open threat against any new
       invasion and trying to make a few credits while they're at it.
You too have felt the lure of this; the desire for a unique freedom that most
citizens will never know, the drive to explore, the need to defend your species,
         and yes, greed for the vast wealth that is to be had.
                   It is time to take to the stars.

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.

The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the

EAOS transport "Registered Merchant 595" departed to League sector Earthgate
(Alpha-1) approximately 7 minutes ago.
A handful of lonely beacons watch over this area of space, their lights glowing
palely in the dark, surrounded by tendrils of drifting dust and debris.
A planet once existed here, until it was destroyed by the Outsiders. Now only
large chunks of the planet remain, still drifting slowly away from each other,
with clouds of debris filling the sector.
A circular space station dominates this sector, made of darkened metal
reinforced against attack. By the look of it, this is probably the most heavily
armored station in human space, excepting The Torus. This is the heart of the
Accord of Free Worlds.
The computer announces, "Autolander beacon detected. The ship will automatically
proceed to AFW Command (Dock One) in thirty seconds unless aborted or another
navigation order is entered."
Via general sector communication, Accord of Free Worlds Command transmits,
"Hello, William Dove. Welcome to Accord space."

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a

Subject: Regarding Helios Felo Tonic
Author: Morris Corlew
Posted: 19:14 24 August 2317 GST
--
Howdy, folks. I received this letter from 'Doc' Anatolius of Stavros in response
to a photo I sent him of one of the felo that the tonic from Helios was used on.
--
To whom it may concern:
Firstly, thank you for bringing this to my attention.
These creatures, while beautiful, are an unintended side effect from triggering
the felo gene reexpression
 hormone. This genetic realignment can be seen in the 'wild' by introducing felo
to a bari infestation. The
 next generation of felo will contain more aggressive characteristics that are
commonly called 'soldier' felo.
However, this treatment regimen forces immediate reexpression of its genetics as
opposed to requiring the
 next generation to arise. The intended effect was to vastly increase its
lifespan beyond normal expectations
 versus Miracle Tonic(TM), and is effective in a double-blind study against
Miracle Tonic(TM), placebo, and
 my formulation. Unfortunately, it seems that the compound is somewhat more
sensitive than expected. Human
 DNA on the felo may cause expression of human-like characteristics. Similarly,
melanocytes are easier to
 create than take away, which means that the flesh coloration will trend towards
deep browns, excepting
 instances of albinism in any contaminant and within the felo's genome.
My team will consider researching a more robust formulation that is less
sensitive to contamination, but we
 suspect that to reliably increase lifespan beyond that which is provided by the
Miracle Tonic(TM), a large
 (and thus sensitive to contamination such as the current formulation) dose may
be required. There are some
 analogues that we might explore, but that has not had much energy applied to
it.
Similarly, I postulate that a human proving to be a constant threat towards a
nest of felo will develop
 similar characteristics in order to best ensure survival. However, this is far
beyond the pale and I condemn
 anyone who attempts such experiments - humane treatment of living things is
very important for ethical
 science.
Finally, there seems to be a misconception that this formulation contains
mutagen or is tainted with the DNA
 of some individual or another. It does not, and would be quite safe to drink if
one were so inclined, though
 I do not advise anyone to. The primary active ingredient of it is a solution of
felo genetic reexpression
 hormone and a carefully selected stimulus to trigger extended lifespans.
Love,
Anatolius of Stavros

Shule,
 
I hate to dredge up the QSA meeting again, but the liaison office is telling me
that the reason no agreement was reached is because "the Mutuality refused to
properly discuss any particular trade option." This was not my understanding of
what you guys said happened at the negotiations or my understanding of what you
said happened at the meeting we had with Mr. Lambeth about the negotiations. I
thought I would ask one last time for you to clarify your thoughts on what
happened, in writing, so that we might have a more permanent record and the
opportunity to present the information to the liaison office, if necessary.
 
Did we offer anything specific in return for QSA access? Did the council
explicitly explain why they weren't interested in these offers?
 
Did the council ever explicitly state what they wanted in return for QSA access?
If so, what was it that they wanted?
 
Was the encroachment into Mutuality space by the AEU fleet brought up at all
during the negotiations? If so, by which party, and in what context?
 
There's no rush to answer, I just wanted to straighten these details out for
myself and for the office in case we ever reopen negotiations. This is looking
less and less likely, at least in the near future, but at least this way some
future Voice serving in less mad times will have more detailed notes about the
chain of events.
 
I beg to remain your most humble and obediant servant,
Constantine

[Starship "Deadly Strike"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is at New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad.
You see a decoy beacon launcher, a wormhole drive tracer, and a dark green
leather captain's chair here.
You can go east, southeast, and out.

[New Earth; Spaceport Landing Pad]
The busy landing pad of New Earth's capital city's spaceport sits over a large
bay at the tip of the southern continent. The pad itself is a huge square sheet
of white plasteel surrounded by gleaming new starship service structures. On the
southern side of the pad is a circular structure with wide transparisteel
windows affording a fabulous view of the ocean. A softly lit sign over the
transparisteel doorway reads, 'Pilot Lounge,' and a separate doorway is marked
'Liaison Office.' It looks like you can GO into either of those places. To the
west, a bridge spans the gap between the landing pad and the rest of the
spaceport.
The vostok-class capsule "Hummingbird Express", the four-person mule "Lion's
Den", the long-range sightseer "Wandering Soul", and the two-person flare
"Deadly Strike" are landed here.
You see an automatic teller machine, a small trash can, and a sanitation drone
here.
You can go north, south, west, and down.

[Starship "Kalina"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.

Lily,
 
I hate to dredge up the QSA meeting again, but the liaison office is telling me
that the reason no agreement was reached is because "the Mutuality refused to
properly discuss any particular trade option." This was not my understanding of
what you guys said happened at the negotiations or my understanding of what you
said happened at the meeting we had with Mr. Lambeth about the negotiations. I
thought I would ask one last time for you to clarify your thoughts on what
happened, in writing, so that we might have a more permanent record and the
opportunity to present the information to the liaison office, if necessary.
 
Did we offer anything specific in return for QSA access? Did the council
explicitly explain why they weren't interested in these offers?
 
Did the council ever explicitly state what they wanted in return for QSA access?
If so, what was it that they wanted?
 
Was the encroachment into Mutuality space by the AEU fleet brought up at all
during the negotiations? If so, by which party, and in what context?
 
There's no rush to answer, I just wanted to straighten these detail out for
myself and for the office in case we ever reopen negotiations. This is looking
less and less likely, at least in the near future, but at least this way some
future Voice serving in less mad times will have more detailed notes about the
chain of events.
 
I beg to remain your most humble and obediant servant,
Constantine

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an
insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid
service robot here.

[Starship "William Dove"; Control Room]
The control room is the hub of every starship. Large metal conduits protect
thick bundles of wires carrying information from every part of the ship to this
one location. A large transparisteel viewport provides a view out the front of
the ship, but experienced pilots in space will have eyes only for the large
starmap dominating the right side of the room. Standing before the viewport is
the main control board, providing essential functions like the shipwide power
lever and alert status. Secondary control boards can be pulled up and folded
back to provide a working surface, or pulled down from recesses overhead as
needed. Though the room is spacious enough for a few others to sit or stand, the
entire architecture of the room is built around the small space before the
control board and the person who will stand there: the starship's pilot. The
status lights overhead are currently not receiving power. Looking through the
windows, you see that the ship is in a garage.
You see a sleek metal quantum entanglement communication device, a rattan floor
lamp with a light purple lotus shade (casting a white-colored glow), a wormhole
drive tracer, a dark purple leather captain's chair, a large oval white and
black cloth rug, a rare black EAOSian contoured couch with a hand-made white and
sapphire star quilt on it, a round white rattan coffee table with a glass top, a
glossy silver ceramic felo chow bowl, a wall-sized bubbling neon purple-lit
aquarium containing yellow and red aquatic life and coral rocks, a small white
trash bin, a black plastic tray of spider chow, a compact white refrigerator, an
insulated black cooler, a robotic chef named Nellie, and Purr the humanoid
service robot here.
